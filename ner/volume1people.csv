Taylor	PERSON	, no doubt , justly thinking proper to have his eye toward , went after them to the cabbin , door without going down ; whereupon he was immediately menaced and insulted , as suspecting the honour of the king 's men , and although he made no other than a moderate civil reply , as several passengers on board can testify , he was immediately furiously attacked and knocked down , where he was beaten in a most inhuman manner till the deck was besmeared with blood , and at the same time shamefully insulted with the infernal language common to such crews , -LRB- and which but for offending the civilized ear might be repeated -RRB- they then threatened to throw him overboard and drown him , took the command of his boat , and after gratifying their malice by towing her about in the river , took her along side the schooner , where the illustrious Captain detained her a considerable time , insulting and abusing the skipper , and justifying and applauding the conduct of his heroic men , who ` had thus brought him a common shallop with two or three men on board , without the least appearance of clandestine conduct ; after the gallant Captain with his crew had somewhat glutted their rancour , they dismissed the shallop , but

Taylor	PERSON	immediately produced them , The hatch was then opened and the hogsheads counted and compared , which agreeing with the papers , the officer asked further , whether
Taylor	PERSON	had not something more on board , or in the cabin , and in a very scoffing manner enquired whether he had not some teas ,
Taylor	PERSON	replied , he was welcome to go into the cabin and see himself , assuring him at the same time that nothing was on board besides the rum and limes : then the officer and two sailors went into the cabin and stayed some time , on which
Taylor	PERSON	went to the cabin door and looked in ; the Officer asked what he wanted ,
Taylor	PERSON	replied , I did not know there was any body in the cabin but you ー the officer then got into a violent rage , cursing and swearing in the most dreadful manner , and coming upon deck used many horrid imprecations and threats against
Taylor	PERSON	, that he would kick him over-board , & c. for suspecting the
Taylor	PERSON	so that the deck was prodigiously besmeared with his blood .
Taylor	PERSON	gave not the least provocation , but , on the contrary , both in his words and behavior shewed the greatest respect and submission , and never resisted or attempted to touch the officer .
Graves	PERSON	, who was walking on the quarter-deck of the schooner , that `` this fellow has rum and limes on board '' whereupon the Capt. immediately got into the boat with several sailors , came on board the shallop and without any examination highly approved of the conduct of the officer in beating
Taylor	PERSON	, -LRB- who at that time was leaning bleeding violently in the cockpit -RRB- and said that if he had been on board he would have given him twice as much , and threatened to kick his teeth down his throat , and to take him on board the schooner , and there to tie him up and whip him .

Arnold	PERSON	, after we had generously told him our whole plan , strenuously contended and insisted that he had a right to command them and all their officers , which bred such a mutiny among the soldiers which had nearly frustrated our whole design , as our men were for clubbing their fire-locks and marching home , but were prevented by Colonel
Allen	PERSON	and Colonel
Easton	PERSON	, who told them that he should not take the command of them , and if he had , their pay would be the same as though they were under their command ; but they would damn the pay , and say they would not be commanded by any others but those they engaged with ; and after the
Garrison	PERSON	was surrendered , Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	again assumed the command of the
Garrison	PERSON	, although he had not one man there , and demanded it of Colonel

-LSB- James -RSB- Easton	PERSON	himself , is so replete with falshood , and is so great an imposition on the public , that I think it my duty , in order to undeceive the public , and to do justice to modest merit , to give you a candid detail of the whole matter , for the truth of which I appeal to every officer and private who were present , which is as follows : Some gentlemen arrived in the
-LSB- Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	and
Easton	PERSON	, the former , with the assistance of Captain -LSB-
Seth -RSB- Warner	PERSON	, collected about 150 men , with whom they marched to
Easton	PERSON	, and proceeded 10 miles towards
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	, arrived at
Allen	PERSON	, -- when Col.
Arnold	PERSON	made known his commission , & c -- it was voted by the officers present , that he should take a joint command with Col.
Allen	PERSON	-LRB- Col.
Easton	PERSON	not presuming to take any command -RRB- -- When the party had marched to
Arnold	PERSON	, with much difficulty , persuaded about 40 men to embark with him in a batteau accidentally taken there , and landed half a mile from the fort , and immediately sent back the batteau , which by reason of a violent storm of wind and rain did not return until break of day with a small boat , and near 50 men in both , -- It was then proposed by some gentlemen to wait open day , and the arrival of the remainder of the men which amounted at that time to near 100 ; this Col.
Arnold	PERSON	strenuously opposed , and urged to storm the fort immediately , declaring he would enter it alone , if no man had courage to follow him -- this had the desired effect , he with Col.
Allen	PERSON	headed the party and proceeded directly to the fort -- when they came within about 10 yards of the gate , the centry discovered them and made a precipitate retreat , he was pursued closely by Col.
Arnold	PERSON	, who was the first person that entered the fort , and Col.
Allen	PERSON	about 5 yards behind him -- this I was an eye witness of being only a few yards distant .
Arnold	PERSON	immediately order 'd the men to secure the doors of the barracks , and went himself with Col.
Allen	PERSON	to the commanding officer ,
Easton	PERSON	until 9 o'clock , and was told he was the last man that entered the fort , and that , not till the soldiers and their arms were secured , he having concealed himself in an old barrack near the redoubt , under the pretence of wiping and drying his gun , which he said had got wet in crossing the
Easton	PERSON	, in a base and cowardly manner abuse Col.
Arnold	PERSON	behind his back , though always very complaisant before his face -- Col.
Arnold	PERSON	was soon made acquainted with the liberty he had taken with his character , and upon his refusing to give proper satisfaction , I had the pleasure of seeing him heartily kicked by

Newbern	PERSON	a motley mob , without any previous notice of their purpose , appeared coming towards my
Abner Nash	PERSON	, an Attorney , ard the oracle of the
Newbern	PERSON	then present to signify their purpose in waiting upon me , that it was in consequence of a general alarm , the People of the place had taken that morning at my dismounting some pieces of old cannon which lay behind my house , and which had occasionally been made use of on rejoicing days ; that this circumstance had caused alarm , because the Governor of
Nash	PERSON	, and satisfied also that it was a mere pretext for insulting me , I replied that the visit of the inhabitants of
Newbern	PERSON	and to give them every reasonable satisfaction , I then declared to them that I had dismounted the Guns , and laid them on the ground because the carriages were entirely rotten and unserviceable and incapable of bearing the discharge of them on the King 's birthday that was at hand , and for the celebration of which I was making the usual preparation of those Guns .
Nash	PERSON	said he was persuaded the Answer I had condescended to give would be very satisfactory to the Inhabitants of
Gage	PERSON	, and that Lieutenant Governor
-LSB- Cadwallader -RSB- Colden	PERSON	at
Gage	PERSON	, would be at once betrayed , and to fear at the same time that the expected Stores might come in a Merchant 's Vessel to

Gage	PERSON	of my situation , and I set out almost at the same time for this place , where one of His Majesty 's Sloops of War is stationed , intending as well as the security of my person in all events that I could not yet expose with any possible advantage to His Majesty 's Service , as to employ the most effectual means with the assistance of Capt.
-LSB- Francis -RSB- Parry	PERSON	Commander of the Cruizer Sloop of War , to secure the Arms and Ammunition if they should be sent away before my advices , dispatched with my family , should reach
Parry	PERSON	the circumstances I have here related to your Lordship , suggesting my wishes at the same time , that he could spare from his Ship a sufficient force to waylay at
Parry	PERSON	to whom my Lord , I owe it in justice to say that he embraces with the utmost alacrity every occasion to promote the
Gage	PERSON	, which caused Mr
Colden	PERSON	and myself so much anxiety , were what I have since received a few , that contained nothing more than an Account of the Affair of the 20th of April between a Detachment of the King 's Troops and the People of the neighborhood of
Gage	PERSON	.
Gage	PERSON	, I could not only maintain the sovereignty of this Province to His Majesty , with the power I could collect immediately among the Emigrants from the Highlands of
His Majesty	PERSON	and His Government , that I am assured by the best authority I may compute at 3000 effective men , but should be able to draw together under that protection , out 01 the interior Counties of this Province , where the People are in General well affected , much attached to me , at least two thirds of the fighting men in the whole Country ; which may be computed according to my best information to exceed Thirty Thousand and with which I could effectually restore order here and in
Gage	PERSON	is at this time employed , may not afford him leisure to attend minutely to objects at this distance , I should ardently wish , that the importance of my proposition above mentioned , may be taken into consideration by your Lordship , and submitted to the King , and in the case of its meeting with His Majesty 's Royal Approbation , that the supplies of arms and ammunition I have requested of General
Gage	PERSON	should be sent in a fourfold proportion to me from

Fort Johnston	PERSON	was intended to protect the Inhabitants of

Collet	PERSON	has now come to our knowledge , a glaring invasion of private property in unwarrantably seizing a Quantity of Corn , the more inexcusable as provisions have never been withheld from him when ever he would pay for them , which provisions so seized we beg your Excellency would order him to restore to the proper owner , as also any Slave or slaves the property of other persons which he now harbours and detains .

JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	TO LORD
John -RSB- Collet	PERSON	's just and well grounded Representations that he would not pretend to hold the place , with only three or four men that he could depend upon , against a multitude said to be collecting to attack it , determined me to dismount the Artillery that is considerable in value , and to lay it under cover of the Cruizer 's Guns .
Garrison	PERSON	, with the shot , and movable Stores , and shipped them on Board the vessel lately arrived from
Johnston My Lord	PERSON	, is a most contemptible thing , fit neither for the place of Arms , or an Asylum for the friends of Government , on account of the weakness and smallness of it , so that the keeping of it is of little consequence , and the Kings Artillery which is all that is good about it , will be as well secured under cover of the Cruizer 's Guns , at less charge , as upon the Walls of that little wretched place ; if I could furnish it with a sufficient
Garrison	PERSON	, which I could now only collect out of the Highlanders upon whom , by drawing forth a number of them for such a service , I should immediately turn the resentment of the whole Country , before they are provided with the means of defence , and by that step perhaps frustrate my best and fairest expectations , formed upon the strength and good dispositions of that people in this Colony .

STEPHEN	PERSON	BULL TO
HENRY LAURENS	PERSON	, PRESIDENT OF THE
Beaufort	PERSON	19th of August 1775 Sir Yesterday I did myself the honor of writing to the President of the Council of Safety by Captain
-LSB- Clement	PERSON	-RSB- Lempriere who commanded the Schooner which has the Gun Powder on board , and in that Letter I would have been more full , had not the Wind and tide suited for Captain
Lempriere	PERSON	to sail immediately ; but soon after they got under Sail a thunder Squal came up the River by which means the tide was lost ; which has given me an opportunity of writing again by Captain
Lempriere	PERSON	, in my last I mentiond that I should keep a sufficient number of men in this Town , untill the Powder was safely out of this River , which would have been in a few hours , had not the
Squal	PERSON	happend ; as soon as the Vessels were under Sail I discharged a detachment from two Companies of
Lempriere	PERSON	had lost the tide and could not proceed , I detain 'd a number of other Men so as to have one hundred & Sixty of my Regiment , which added to the detachment of Provincials under Captain Cattles -LSB- either
Benjamin	PERSON	or
William Cattell	PERSON	-RSB- command , with the detachment of Grenadiers and Artillery from
Charles Town	PERSON	amounting in all to two Hundred and fifty , a force which I thought would be sufficient for the intended Service ー these Men I shall detain untill the Vessell with the Powder is out of this River , which I expect will be by one O'clock , when I will discharge the Men until farther Ordersー In your favor of the 3rd Instt , you are pleased to say , that the Report of My being censured by the
John -RSB- Joyner	PERSON	, -LRB- the Person who was suspected -RRB- before I had related to you the manner of the Powder being left here , and requesting the favo -LSB- ur -RSB- of you to acquaint me , who the ungenerous Person was that presumed to make so free with my Conduct , but as Captain
Joyner	PERSON	has declared to one of my Officers who spoke to him on the Subject that he was innocent of the matter ー gives me occasion once more to repeat my requisition , and I shall take it as a singular favor if you will let me know as much as you conveniently can , being fully convinced I have been unfairly dealt with in some representation , if not with regard to the Powder , or I flatter myself the
Joyner	PERSON	or -LSB- Tunes -RSB- Teabout -LSB- Tibout -RSB- to raise an
Joyners	PERSON	influence and Conduct on the expedition he was sent to take the Powder from -LSB-
Richard -RSB- Maitland	PERSON	, you may form some Idea , when I tell you that some days after my return from
Charles Town	PERSON	I accidentall -LSB- y -RSB- fell in here , where I heard that a Canoe had come up from the
Joyner	PERSON	, had but fifteen Men , six of which were the provincial Recruits left at the Camp by Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Barnwell	PERSON	, and I judgeing it expedient did send Captain
John Bull	PERSON	with upwards of twenty Volunteers , who staid with
Joyner	PERSON	and assisted in taking the Powder , and had he applied as he should have done to me I Could with the same ease have sent him two Hundred Men or more if necessary .
Joyner	PERSON	in your esteem but to shew you that he is a Man of no influence , and that a command of the sort he expects , will be takeing him entirely out of his Element ー In his own Sphere I would give him the preference of a Command to any Man in this Countyー You may perhaps be a little surprised to find 400 1b of Powder being again left here , which was mentioned to me , tho ' I approved of the Scheme , knowing the necessities of the People , to avoid Censure , I declined haveing anything to do with it ー I have the honor to be -LSB- & c. -RSB- Step n
