<P>THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY </P>

<P>WASHINGTON </P>

<P>March 3, 1969 </P>

<P>FOREWORD </P>

<P>On 13 October 1775 the Continental Congress authorized the first two ships of the Navy. From this small beginning we have seen the country's Navy grow into a most powerful force for the security of our nation. It has also continued, as it began, as a force for the defense of freedom-our own and that of our allies, who are united to us by the sea only if we keep strong on it. </P>

<P>In this valuable documentary series, through the words of participants and eye witnesses, we read of a small Continental Naval force which promptly challenged Britain's absolute control of the sea. Our first amphibious expedition landed in the Bahamas 3 March 1776, and captured gravely needed munitions, proving to the foe that the infant American Navy was a threat to be reckoned with. </P>

<P>Likewise we read in this volume how the tight siege by Gen- eral Washington's army forced the British garrison out of Boston. Yet because the Royal Navy controlled the sea, the troops embarked in their transports and sailed away without loss under the guns of the Royal Navy. . Where or when they would come over the hori- zon to strike again from the sea anywhere down the long coast, no one could predict with certainty. But with their powerful fleets it was clear they would strike again and soon. From the letters and other documents in these pages we can also sense the quickening of the Revolution and inexorable march toward the Declaration of Independence -and in time to the entry of France, Spain and Holland to turn the conflict into the fourth World War of the 18th century. </P>

<P>As our nation approaches the two hundredth anniversary of its birth, this series emphasizes once again the unchanging significance of seapower. </P>

<H1>3n Memoriam </H1>

<P>On 31 October 1968, when this Volume was still in page proof, William Bell Clark left his typewriter, beloved manuscripts, and notes for the last time. He never awakened from that evening's sleep but instead quietly embarked upon the great Joyage beyond earth's last horizon. His was a full and satisfying life of devoted work and marked achievement. Mr. Clark's unique knowledge of early naval history and his great industry will be sorely missed, and will be an inspiration to those of us who carry forward this monumental series. </P>

<H2>INTRODUCTION 
</H2>

<P>&quot;No man is an island unto himself&quot; in this age of satellite communication, jet aircraft and intercontinental missiles. Yet even in the 18th century, as the documents in this volume point up, the Ear reaching sea made the affairs of the small emerging American nation in some ways the affairs of all. The spark of liberty could not have survived in America without extensive aid from overseas. Among the many significant events in these nautical pages, none had greater impact than France's secret policy to prolong the war through undercover aid that could come only by sea and lvould eventually involve her powerful fleets to bring victory. </P>

<P>It is interesting that at the outset Bourbon autocracy promoted Ameri- can freedom-fanning the fires that would spread to France and destroy the monarchy. Surely Providence works in mysterious and unforeseen ways- as America experienced often during the Revolution and in the stirring years to come when this land of freedom has become a beacon of hope to all men. </P>

<P>The initial decision to include foreign documents relating to the war at sea seems more than ever justified as we get deeper into the years of con- flict. They bring breadth of perspective, significance and deeper meaning. At the same time the growing sea of documents has vastly increased our task of selection. It has taken four broad-beamed volumes to reach to the first months of the second year of the Revolution. Documents printed in the volumes contain the principal, but by no means all the large holdings collected in the Naval History Division for this period. Through drastic editorial review, extracting or eliminating material, and footnote references, we have been able to extend the time span of Volume 4 over that covered in Volume 3. We will hold this course of selection even more closelv in sub- sequent volumes. </P>

<P>The wholehearted support of libraries, historical societies, museums, </P>

<P>archives, other depositories, and private collectors and researchers in the </P>

<P>United States and abroad continues to make this work a reality. Unpub- </P>

<P>lished Crown copyright material in the publib Record Office is reproduced </P>

<P>by permission of the Controller of H.M. Stationery Office. </P>

<P>We were able to get this great editorial project underway a decade ago </P>

<P>because of the knowledge and dedication of William Bell Clark. In his </P>

<P>heart was an abiding love for the American Revolution as affected by naval </P>

<P>events. In his mind he had stored information from a lifetime of research </P>

<P>and reading. In his library he had tens of thousands of pages of transcripts </P>

<P>relating to the Revolution. Therefore, when he quietly sailed on into vaster seas we suffered a grievous loss indeed in a splendid American, an esteemed friend, and an editor whose knowledge can not be fully replaced by any man alive. We will carry on this series but will not cease to think of him and miss him. </P>

<P>Within the Naval History Division the key to this project's success and steady progress continues to be the intelIigent know-how, intense interest, and hard work of Dr. ?Villiam James Morgan and his devoted crew in our Historical Research Section-Lieutenant Patrick A. Lyons, Mr. Robert I. Campbell, Mr. and Mrs. Henry J. Scheffenacker, Mrs. Eleanor Roll, Yeo- man First Class Joseph V. Eckert, Miss Anne Kenenski, and a talented part time worker in our vineyard, Mr. arti in Petersilia. </P>

<P>Lieutenant Raymond P. Schmidt and Chief Personnelman George K. McCuistien, on summer Naval Reserve duty with us, made significant con- tributions. Mr. W. Bart Greenwood, Navy Department Librarian, and Miss Mary Pickens did a fine job with the maps as did Mr. Charles R. Haberlein Jr., of the Curator's Branch, with other illustrations. </P>

<P>France's secret decisions that highlight the importance of the sea for the future of America represent only a small portion of the material in Volume 4 that points up this unchanging verity in history of the sea's mighty role. For example, on one day in 1776, 19 April, the first anniversary of the embattled patriots' stand at Lexington and Concord, we find these wide spread indications: </P>

<H2>EDITOR'S PREFACE 
</H2>

<P>Several of the most significant events of the war for independence appear in the pages of this, the fourth volume of~Naval Documents of the Ameri-can Revolution. Foremost are the resolves of the Continental Congress establishing a definite naval policy. Operations of all war vessels, whether Continental, those under General Washington, or those of the Colonies, had been limited to protection of ports and coastal waters, and capture of British ships of war or any vessel carrying troops, munitions, supplies or provisions to the enemy. But, in March 1776 Congress authorized commis- sioning of privateers (letters of marque and reprisal) and allowed unre-stricted capture of any vessel of any description carrying the English flag. In early April Congress implemented this action through specific instruc- tions to its commanders on land and sea, and to each of the thirteen c010- </P>

<P>nies. </P>

<P>Second in importance, and following along a month later, was George 111's proclamation banning all commerce with his rebellious colonies under the Prohibitory Act. This, also, provided for unrestricted warfare against his disobedient subjects in North America. </P>

<P>Thirdly is the &quot;Considerations on the Affair of the English Colonies in America,&quot; by the Count de Vergennes. In a document intended primarily for the eyes of his Spanish counterpart, the French Foreign Minister set forth the aims of the two Courts-prolong the war for at least a year by continuing surreptitious aid to the British colonies in America; assure Great Britain at the same time that they ardently desired peace; and make no treaty with the Americans until the latter had declared independence and had demonstrated ability to maintain it. &quot;Because a year gained,&quot; wrote Ver- gennes, &quot;for measures of vigour and foresight, may, in many respects, change the aspect of affairs.&quot; </P>

<P>Resolves and pronouncements, however, are but a small, though con- sequential part of this volume. The first Continental Fleet made a success- ful amphibious assault on New Providence, in the Bahamas. Commodore Hopkins' ships carried off the island governor, cannon, and stores, but a bungle denied the American raiders any sizeable quantity of the garrison's gunpowder. All this is described in letters and other documents, along with accounts of the inexperienced Fleets' rather ignominious encounter with </P>

<P>H.M.S. Glasgow. </P>

<P>xiii </P>

<P>Two more vessels were added to the Continental Navy in this same period: ship Reprisal and brig Lexington. Early cruises of the latter are related, including the sharp engagement with and capture of H.M. Sloop Edward: &quot;We shattered her in a terrible manner as you will see.&quot; Likewise, these pages reveal the building progress of some of the thirteen frigates authorized earlier by Congress, as well as the expansion of the navies of six of the colonies-Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Vir- ginia, and South Carolina. </P>

<P>The British side.of the picture during the months covered in this vol- ume is amply depicted. Letters and ships' journals tell of frustration in the attempt to recover all of the rice ships in Savannah harbor; of the futile effort to ascend the Cape Fear River and join force with the Scotch Tories already defeated at Moore's Creek bridge; of the storms that delayed the arrival of the naval and military expedition against the Southern colonies; of the evacuation of Boston and sailing of the British army to Halifax; and of the lone success, relief of Quebec and rout of the bedraggled American besiegers. </P>

<P>It was during this period that Congress sent Silas Deane as its first envoy to France. Deane went armed with contracts for the military stores it was hoped he could obtain from the French court, or profit-minded French merchants. His instructions and his difficulties in getting clear of the American coast are set forth in considerable detail. At the same time, is des- cribed how Richard Lord Howe was cajoled by the King to take command of the British fleet. Howe was the third admiral to attempt the impossible task of stopping the flow of powder and arms from Europe and the West Indies to the American fighting forces. </P>

<P>Twice the enemy probed the defenses of American ports. One was an abortive raid by a sloop-of-war into upper Chesapeake Bay, and the other an engagement-in the Delaware River between two British frigates and Penn- sylvania row galleys. The first day of this inconclusive battle brings Volume 4 to a close. </P>

<P>The editorial policy followed in this documentary series is detailed in Volumes 1 and 2. The editor wishes to repeat his sincere appreciation to the individuals and depositories whose cooperation has made possible the com- pleteness of these hefty volumes, and to the zeal of those listed in Admiral Eller's introductions in this and preceding volumes, for supplying the &quot;bookmaking and infinite labors to make the series as accurate and useful as possible.&quot; </P>

<P>From February 19, 1776, to April 17, 1776 </P>

<P>SUMMARY </P>

<P>The British still held Boston, but their tenure promised to come to an early end with the arrival of cannon dragged across in mid-winter from Ticonderoga. General Howe and Admiral Shuldham were sitting uneasily under the threat of the rapidly growing Continental Army, which sur-rounded the closely beleaguered town, save for the single opening to the sea. Finally using the mobility which naval control assured, the British evacu-ated Boston on March 17 and sailed for Halifax. </P>

<P>In New York, Sir Henry Clinton and Captain Hyde Parker, Jr. viewed with misgivings the sudden arrival of General Charles Lee with several thou- sand men from Connecticut. Then Clinton departed southward; Lee with- drew, and the Tory-minded citizens breathed with relief. </P>

<P>In Canada, a bleak winter, an inadequate army, lack of heavy cannon, insufficient provisions and a wounded commander had stagnated the siege of Quebec. The senior general officer, David Wooster, after the death of Richard Montgomery, had remained in Montreal despite requests from Benedict Arnold to take over before Quebec. </P>

<P>The Continental fleet under Esek Hopkins had sailed from the Capes of the Delaware and launched a successful amphibious assault on New Pro- vidence in the Bahamas where cannon and a large quantity of stores were seized. In Congress, one of the principal subjects in agitation was that of legalizing privateering. Memorials and communications from individuals pressing for letters of marque and reprisal had been received, but no con- clusions reached. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, from most of the thirteen embattled colonies, Provincial Congresses, Committees of Safety and private citizens dispatched unarmed vessels, with local produce for exchange in the foreign West Indies for car- gos of much needed gunpowder and other war material. </P>

<P>Another colonial governor had joined his brethren in flight from his office. Sir James Wright, of Georgia, had been stripped of all authority, and had fled to the protection of British naval vessels. A small British naval squadron would shortly wrest eight merchant ships laden with rice from </P>

<P>the Savannah River, but fail to save others from being burned by the provincials. </P>

<P>In South Carolina, defenses were being strengthened in anticipation of the threatened arrival of a strong expeditionary force from Britain. Off the North Carolina coast, General Clinton had arrived from New York, and awaited the coming of the long-promised and long-delayed army. Its failure to appear in time caused the disastrous defeat of Highlanders and Regu- lators at Moore's Creek Bridge. </P>

<P>Lord Dunmore fumed in futile arrogance in the ashes that once were Norfolk, and Robert Eden sat precariously in the governor's chair at Annap- olis. Only Maryland to this point tolerated a Royal Governor. </P>

<P>[Extract] 	Watertown, Febry 19th 1776. </P>

<P>Yesterday a Gent arrived here, said to be a Prussian Knight, from France to the W Indies, thence bound to Phia, but brot on upon the back of the Cape, from thence hither, &amp; now at head Quarters, has many Letters for Dr [Benjamin] Franklin, a Packet for the President of the Congress, &amp; another for the Secretary of do 'Tis supposed that the Vessel was bound in- to Boston, 'tho he took passage for Phia 'Tis likely you will know more about it before you receive this. -</P>

<P>. . . I've heard more about this Stranger Monsr La Baron &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c, He is a native of Dantzick [Danzig], has been many years in the K of Prussia's Service, is one of the Knights of Malta, has 2 Letters for Dr F, one for Mr Secretary [Charles] Thomson, &amp; many others; he is a Gentleman &amp; a Politician; &amp; says, that all Europe wish our Prosperity; &amp; that the Ho[use] of Bourbon, in particular wish the Colonies to declare for independency, so that they may have nothing to fear from the English. The Baron took pas- sage at the Mole, in a French Vessel bound to Phia, as he understood it; but </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>I suppose she was bound for Nantuckett; &amp; we are credibly informed, that there are 6 or 7 more soon expected: There not being English Vessels to take off their Melasses, they send it in their own Bottoms. This Vessel was loaded with Melasses, &amp; 1 hhd Sugar; she got upon the Sholes within Sight of Nantuckett, lost both Anchors &amp; Cables, &amp; great part of her Sails, &amp; then drifted on upon the back of Chatham; both Vessel &amp; Cargo will be saved, as 'tis supposed. </P>

<P>I dont particularly recollect what I wrote to you in my last; but since that time, conversation has much turn'd upon Independency; &amp; aEter having considered the matter as fully as oppo admited, I am Satisfied in my mind, that this Colony wou'd rejoice most heartily in a Declaration by Congs in favr of it; &amp; it is clear in my mind, that, upon such a Declar[ation], Trade ought to be regulated so that we may be our own Carriers; this will encour- age Ship-building, be a nursery for Sea-men, &amp; will prevent Foreigners ob- taining any great knowledge of our Coasts &amp; Harbours; &amp; if possible, &amp; I think 'tis possible, let us not enter into any Treaty offensive &amp; defencesive with any European Power, so that we may avoid being involved in their Wars. I depend upon it, that [if] we declare for independency, F[rance] &amp; S[pain] will soon attack G[reat] B[ritain], but they v:ill not do it 'till the break between her &amp; the Colonies is incurable. In the mean time we shall grow in Military Strength &amp; Knowledge; &amp; once the Enemy are dislodged from Boston, &amp; we can obtain a Sufficient Stock of Powder &amp; other Military Stores, there will be very little danger of their ever possessing it again; for it can't be long before our own NIanufacturers will furnish all necessary Stores in the Military way; &amp; inspired by our cause, we shall very soon equal, if not exceed Our Enemies in Military Knowledge. -. . . The enemy have burnt 6 or 7 Houses on Dorchester Neck, &amp;stolen two or 3 of the Guards. </P>

<P>of this Part of our Harbour,.you would have been immediately sensible, of the Ease with which an Excursion may be made from the Castle, either upon Squantum Neck, or the Main; where, before a sufficient Force could be col- lected to repel them, our Enemies might rob us of our Provision, burn our Houses, murder or captivate the Inhabitants, who could not escape, and re- treat again to the Castle in less than an Hour, as it is not distant more than a League. Your Excellency would also have seen, two line of Battle Ships, one Frigate, and about 15 large Transports, which have been, above six Weeks past, in Nantasket Road; besides, two or a Dozen arm'd Cruisers, wch are constantly going out in Pursuit of our Privateers, or coming in with their Captures, or expected Transports under their Convoy. </P>

<P>If our Army should take Post upon Dorchester Neck, have we not Rea- son to apprehend, the Shores will be attacked, from a Spirit of Revenge? Certainly, sir, a Fleet can easily spare, and have Boats enough to transport four or five hundred Men, who may, and when the inevitable Impulses of Hunger, or Thirst for Blood, inspires them with sufficient Courage, I fear will, land and ravage along Shore for Miles; any Force we have, at present, to oppose them notwithstanding. </P>

<P>New-York, February 19. We hear from Elizabeth-Town, in New-Jersey, that on Monday the 12th inst. Intelligence arrived in that Town about 11 o'clock at Night, that the Man of War, Transports and Tender, which fell down the Day before from the Harbour of New-York to the Watering Place, with 200 Marines on board, intended to commit Depredations on Staten Island, and furnish themselves with live-stock; General [William] Livingston ordered 300 of the Militia to march forthwith to prevent the intended Robbery; and having dispatched the necessary Orders, and a Party to reconnoitre the South Side of the Island, and to procure all possible Intelligence of the Motions of the Enemy, marched himself about three in the Morning. The several Detach- ments met at Ward's, in Sight of the Light-House, and were there joined by a Company of Light-Horse, under the Command of Captain Blanchard, but learning that the Fleet had left the Hook the Day before, the greater Part of the Troops, still on their March were ordered back, and a proper Number directed to guard the Coast, under the Command of Col. Thomas (lest the Departure of the Enemy might prove a Feint) to give constant Notice of their Return. ' His Majesty's ship the Phoenix of 40 Guns, Capt. [Hyde] Parker [Jr.], sailed for Sandy-Hook last Saturday Morning; and about 2 o'clock the same Day Capt. Vandepot [George Vandeput], in the Asia, of 64 Guns, got under sail, in Company with the Ship Dutchess of Gordon, a ship loaded with salt, and two sloops (the three latter seized by the men of war) but it being half flood, the Asia got aground off Whitehall, and did not float till near High- Water. She now lies in our Bay, with the Dutchess and her Prizes. </P>

<P>[Extract] Philadelphia Febry 19th 1776 Dear Sir Yours of the first Inst is now before me, and would inform you, that the Marine Committee look on you as fully authorised, to Build the Ship to be Built in Neru hampshire and finish her fit for the Sea; if any thing is wanted that you Cannot procure, they Expect you will Give them timely notice: The Draught is Sent forward &amp; you wilI no Doubt receive it before this Comes to hand; I Enquired Concerning the length and Bigness of Cables &amp; weight of anchors, but the Committee has not betermined on it: Govr [Stephen] Hopkins Says he told their Contractor that the Cables must be fifteen Inches, &amp; 120 fathoms Long at least, and had Sent them the De- mentions of the Pallas frigate as a rule for the masts &amp; yards of the 32 Gun Ships; However the Committee advised to apply to the Comissioners for Building the Ships in this City, to know their Determination on those arti- cles which as Soon as I can procure I will Send you. The Marine Committee have given me an order in your favor, for twenty Thousand Dollars, which I was to have Sent by a man who is to take some money for the Ships to be built in Massachusetts, But as you inform me, yo11 have Drawn one and are likely to Draw more orders here, I Believe I Shall not Send the whole by that oppertunity. In Yours of the 29th ulto you informed me that Col Willm Whipple was to Set out for this place the then next rveek, and in Consequence I now look out Sharp for him, &amp; hope he will be here this week, as I am ExtremeIy anxious not only for his Assistance but to be informed of what nature the Difficulties are rvhich you say have u[n]accountably turned up in regard of the Civil Goverment of the Colony, what you have hinted, has Given me vast uneasiness and Could wish you had mentioned the particular Difficul- ties, for I am greatly at a loss to Guess at them: . . . General Lee is ordered for Canada &amp; Schuyler to New York, Col Dickenson [Philemon Dickinson] was Countermanded Just as he was on the march, hearing that Clinton had Sailed. The Common opinion here is, that Comissioners are Coming from England to treat with the Congress, I think it not unlikely, but fear no good will accrue to the Colonies from that meas- ure, if no hurt I shall be glad: Dr [Benjamin] Franklin, Mr Chace [Samuel Chase] &amp; one Caryl of 34aryland are going as Deputies from the Congress to Canada. As to an agent being appointed in the Several Colonies, I Believe it will be a useful Expedient for the Continent, But as yet nothing is Done about it in any of the CoIonies when any thing of that Kind is Done by the Congress in any of the Colonies I rvill take Care that the same be Done for us, and make no Doubt you will be appointed, But think it not proper to </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>you have much more Reason to be so now when you are told of the Arrival of another Ship of WaE ruith a Transport -Col. [Patrick] Henry had certain Information of this Yesterday -they arrived in Hampton Road on Saturday, 8c we are still ignorant who they are or what Force they bring- &amp; what is worse Sir, we have not a Force sufficient to oppose them if they have not brought a single Soldier -for the 5 Men of War now here are able to land 6 or 700 Sailors 8c Marines exclusive of the Tories &amp; Negros Ld Dunmore can furnish -Sc we have not 300 Men at Hampton -not 100 at York, nor 300 in this City -8c the Country People &amp; Militia are not only tvithout Arms, but are lulled into a Stupid Security by the Tales which flatter them with Peace -</P>

<P>I moved on the arrival of the Roebuck that the Neighbouring Militias should be ordered to hold themselves in Readiness to march at an Hours Notice -that such Companies of Regulars as were compleated should be or- dered to this Place, &amp; that all of them should repair with the utmost Expedi- tion to their Rendesvous but the Committee thought these Things quite un- necessary &amp; only gave a Common Order appointing Places of Rendesvous, &amp; alloting Regiments &amp; Officers, which indeed ought to have been done long ago -I moved too, with the like Success, that the Sum of 40 Pounds should be paid to -Bucktrout for his Ingenuity it1 constructing &amp; to defray the Ex- pence of erecting a Powder Mill &amp; to enable him to prosecute his Plan of working up the Salt petre which may be collected in the neighbouring </P>

Counties, with his Hand Powder Mill now at ~vork in this City -The Presi- dent, altho' I told the Committee I would engage to make 100 lb of Powder pr Day with it &amp; endeavoured to shew the Necessity of encouraging such a Work, declared that in his Opinion it was a Bauble Sc 5 Members were of Opinion that it was not xvorth the Rervard I proposed. I was ashamed for the Committee &amp; very much hurt to find that my Recommendation of a Ma- chine which I understood perfectly &amp; had seen tried, &amp; of a Man whose Inge- nuity I had before produced Proofs by sllerving Powder of his Making &amp; proving its Excellence by actual Experiments, had not the least Weight of this Corn: -This Mill Sir alone well attended might supply a great Part of our Country with Powder -I shall do all I can to encourage the Man to go on with his Work. I think private Subscriptions ti1 the Convention meets may enable him to be Very serviceable -The Corn: indeed on finding that many People in Town entertain an high Opinion of this Mill, begin to ap- pear willing to give some kind of encouragement to it -I have scribbled with peat haste in a cro[~v]d so I hope you w~ill excuse my Scrawl </P>

<P>I think it absolutely necessary to follow your Advice respecting our Phil- ada Fleet -I am Much pleased with your sending the Express -I am called to the Committee, urhere they are to consider a Letter from Ld D -I will let you know by my next Opportunity the Result of our Deliberation I am yrs </P>

<P>It never entered into my Thoughts to build Gondola's on Lake Cham- plain, as I well knew that they could not without great Danger If at all, be got into the St Lawrence. Altho' we have very good Ship Carpenters here, Yet none acquainted with the Construction of Gallies. It will therefore be proper to send a few Good Hands from Pennsylvania, as none are to be had in Canada, these ought to be sent immediately. Altho' no Pitch, Tar or Oakham can be sent on until Hudson's River opens, For these Articles I shall apply to the New York Convention. -</P>

<P>[New York] Die Martis, 10 HO. A.M. Feby. 20th, 1776. A letter from Major-Genl. Lee of this day was read and filed, and is in the words following, to wit: New-York, 20th Feb. 1776. Sir -I am just informed that the Asia and Phoenix have seized sev- eral provision vessels from the Jerseys. I must submit it to the Con- gress whether the compact is not to be considered as broke, and whether it is not our duty to withhold all further supplies. For my own part, the measure of suffering ourselves to be plundered, and at the same time feeding our plunderers, appears a degree of lowness of spirit which reflects dishonour and must encourage the enemy still to take greater liberties. I am, sir [kc.] Charles Lee. To Col. Woodhull, Prest. of Provincial Congress. A draft of an answer to Major-Genl. Lee, was read and approved of, and is in the words following, to wit: In Provincial Congress, New-York, Feb. 20th, 1776 Sir -Your favor of this morning has been considered by Congress, and they are of opinion that it is totally impossible to prevent the Asia and Phoenix from supplying themselves with pro-visions. They have received information that the seizing of the vessels from the Jerseys is occasioned by the supplies from the agents in town being stopped, and are apprehensive, if it be contin- ued, that the town will be reduced to the utmost distress. While the navigation of Hudson's river is obstructed by the ice, our prin- cipal dependence for corn, provisions, fuel and hay, is from Con- necticut and the Jerseys; an embargo prevents the supplies from the one, and if we provoke the captains of the ships of war, by way of retaliation to prevent them from the other, the inhabitants will not only be destitute, but our commissary will be incapacitated from procuring the necessary supplies for the army now in town. You will please to consider that the ships of war have it in their power to seize all the provisions that they may find afloat, by which means they will have an opportunity of supplying the enemy at Boston. By order. Major Genl. Lee. Ordered, That a copy thereof be engrossed, and signed by the president and transmitted. </P>

<P>Dear Sir -Williamsburg, February ZOth, 1776. I have just received yours of the 15th instant, and have snatched a mo- ment to write a few lines in answer to it. I approve much of your plan of publishing the hand-bill, and would, before this, have executed it, if my in- disposition and Mrs. Page's illness, added to an incessant round of business, had not prevented me. The method you mention for removing the spikes from cannon, is cer- tainly good; but it is said the cannon at Norfolk are rendered useless, by being broken at their trunnions and buts. I will endeavour, sir, to prevail on our committe to send you regularly authentic accounts of every material occurrence here, and of the state of the enemy's strength. I wrote you yes- terday an account of the arrival of another man of war, and a transport or two; this report has not been contradicted, nor have we yet heard from whence or what these ships are. Captain Hammond of the Roebuck, we are well assured, has behaved with great politeness and humanity to several of our people. Lord Dunmore had written a letter to Colonel [Richard] Corbin, in which he offers to go to England to negotiate peace; he professes the warmest attachment to this country, and says that he lays hold on the last sentence in the king's speech, to offer his services to procure a lasting, speedy, and honourable accomodation. No one, but Lord Dun- more, could have applied that sentence in the manner he has. I will send you a copy of the letter by the post. Colonel Corbin laid the letter before the committee of safety, and received a letter from the committee, which I will also send you. In it we told the colonel, that we were neither empow- ered nor inclined to intermeddle with the mode of negotiation; that we looked to the Congress for the management of this important matter; but added, we would lay his letter belore the assembly, which is to meet on their adjournment, and that Lord Dunmore might manifest his good intentions by suspending hostilities. Colonel Corbin set out this morning to Hamp- ton, with orders to Colonel [William] Grayson to send him with a flag of truce to Lord Dunmore. We gave him to understand, that his lordship should deliver up the slaves now with him immediately. The old gentle- </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 	23 </P>

<P>man went off in great hopes of procuring a month's truce at least, and seemed determined to give Captain Hammond a true statement of Lord Dunmore's conduct. Since writing my letter of yesterday, the committee have ordered down the saltpetre which had been sent to Petersburg, to be worked up by Buckstrout. I hope from this that they will at length encour- age him, and enable him to carry on the manufacturing of gunpowder to a considerable extent. The report of the burning of Portsmouth was entirely </P>

<P>Norfolk, February 20. In my last I acquainted you with the destruction of the greatest part of Norfolk by the Shirtmen, on the 1st of January; they continued plundering and destroying until the 6th inst. when, at Four o'clock in the morning, a sig- nal was made, every Ilouse from Mr.Farmer's plantation, tan-works, wind- mills, church &amp;c. were set on fire, and so quick you could not tell which began first. The people are in great distress; they are driving them all up to the back country; and they intend serving all Norfolk county, Princess Ann, and the lower part of Nancymond in the same manner. The Shirtmen remain at Kemp's Great Bridge, and Suffolk, and stop all provisions corning to the shipping. If troops do not soon arrive, this part of the country will be in a most dreadful situation. Capt. Chesholm and £am- ily have lived in a tent in the woods since New Year's Day. My wife and children stay most of their time with him, hut I have never been so far from </P>

<P>Antigua. Be it known unto all Men That on this present Tuesday the.twentieth Day of February in the Year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred and seventy six Before me John Wilkins Notary Public by Lawful Authority duly admitted and sworn residing in' Antigua, Personally came and appeared Christopher Kelly, William Armitage, and Robert Welford Surgeons Persons worthy of good Credit, who being all duly sworn upon the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, severally depose and say -That on Wednesday the twenty fifth Day of October last past they sailed, from the Downs by Virtue of an Order from Government, in the Ship Fanny Daniel Sinclair Master which said Ship was laden with Porter, Coals, Hospital Stores and sundry other Ar- ticles, and bound to Boston for the use of his Majesty's Garrison there. -</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 25 </P>

<P>That on Sunday the seventh day of January following they discovered land, which they were told was about five Leagues distance to the North West. -That towards noon the following Day it grew calm and a fog came on which continued an hour or thereabouts, and between three and four o'clock the same afternoon they saw plainly a Building of a Pyramidal form at a considerable distance which they took to be a Light House, and the Captain's Orders being very strict as they understood, they for a great part of the Night kept sailing &amp; two Hours then wore Ship and sailed outagain for the same space of time in hopes of meeting with a Man of War or getting a Pilot on board, but could not meet with either. -That on the next Day being the ninth in the Morning the Wind shifted and blew very fresh, and towards noon it became so violent that for the preservation of the Ship and Cargo and their own lives they endeavoured to get out of the Bay as soon as possible which they did in the Evening when it blew a perfect Storm and continued so for some time. -That being under the apprehension of not having sufficient Water to serve them to any of the West India Islands should the Captain be again frustrated in his Attempt to get into Port, and being also at that time actually limited to an allowance of no more than a quart of Water per Day and obliged to catch all the Rain Water they could as it fell from the Clouds, they bore away, and arrived in Basseterre Road, St Christopher's on Monday the fifth day of February following. -</P>

<P>And the said Christopher Kelly and William Armitage speaking for themselves depose and say that on the Day following in the forenoon hap- pening to be at the Tavern commonly known by the name of Stro[torn] Tavern in the Town of Basseterre in the said Island of Saint Christopher's they met with Captain Sinclair, who informed them that he intended to Sail that afternoon for Jamaica, where he meant to dispose of the Cargo he had on board and said he should be answerable to Government for his Conduct in that respect, that in consequence of such his resolution these Deponents must leave his Ship; or else proceed to Jamaica with him where he had no objection to putting them on shore; But farther advised them to go to An- tigua where they would meet with a Passage to Boston for a small considera- tion and might probably go much sooner from thence than from any other place. -</P>

<P>And the said, Robert Welford speaking for himself deposeth and saith that in consequence of the information he received from the before men- tioned Deponent Christopher Kelly of the sudden intended departure of Captain Sinclair to Jamaica, he went directly to the Tavern where he met with the said Captain Sinclair, and taking him to one end of the room ex- pressed his Surprize at what he had heard, and asked him if he was really de- termined not to go to Boston. To which he answered he had formed that resolution and had acquainted the Gentlemen with it, meaning the said Christopher Kelly and William Armitage, and that he should proceed immediately to Jamaica, Whereupon this Deponent then demanded of him what they were to do there, and how they were to be conveyed from thence to Boston; When he replied that our best way was to [hire] a Vessel in St </P>
<Figure>

<ImageData src="images/volume4_part1_img_10.jpg"/>
</Figure>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 </P>

<P>Christopher's to convey us to Antigua where in all probability a passage might be got at a trifling expence; that if we pleased he would take us to Ja- maica, but as he was determined not to go to Boston, it would be much out of our way, as in that place he should finally set us ashore, that if he took us to Jamaica we should certainly be a fortnight or three Weeks bearing up from thence to Antigua, and concluded by adding that he should be obliged to us if we would go aboard and pack up our Baggage. </P>

<P>And these Deponents further deposing say that they accordingly did pack up their Baggage and got it ashore, and also say that the said Captain Sinclair sailed from thence the evening of the same Day. -</P>

<P>That on Thursday the eighth of the said Month of February they hired a Sloop to bring them to Antigua where they arrived on Saturday the Tenth and on the Day following the Deponent Robert Welford waited upon Vice- Admiral [James] Young Commanding his Majesty's Squadron in these Seas and informed him of the above Circumstances. -</P>

<P>All which Matters and Things being solemnly sworn to by the said Christopher Kelly, William Armitage, and Robert Welford, I the said No- tary, Do hereby Certify and make manifest the same. -</P>

<P>In Testimony of the Truth whereof the said Deponents have hereunto respectively set their Hands; And in Faith and Testimony whereof I, the said Notary have hereunto set my Hand and affixed my Notarial Seal at An- </P>

<P>[New Brunswick] Wednesday, February 2 1, 1776. A letter from the Right Honourable William Earl of Stirling was re- ceived and read, and is in the words following: New York, 20th February 1776. Sir: -As the Asia man-of-war, with her attendants, have now taken their station in the bay below this city, and the Phoenix between the Narrows and Sandyhook, and do take every provision vessel coming from New Jersey; it is become highly proper to prevent any provisions or produce of any kind being shipped from New Jersey to this or any other place whatsoever, while those ships con- tinue in a situation which will enable them to make seizures of them. I have, therefore, General Lee's directions to request, that the Congress of New Jersey will give immediate directions to pre- vent any provisions or other produce being shipped or sent off from any part of East New Jersey, that can possibly fall into the hands of the enemy. I am, sir [kc.] Stirling. The President of the Congress of the Province of New Jersey, at New Brunswick. The Congress, sensible of the expediency of the above request, do Re-solve, That provisions and all other kinds of produce of this Colony, be immediately prevented from being sent to New York, or other parts, where- by they must pass New York bay, or the bay between Sandy-hook and Perth Amboy, or Staten Island: And all owners and masters of vessels of every kind, are prohibited from sending any provisions or produce from any part of this Province as aforesaid, until permitted by this Congress. </P>

<P>[Philadelphia] Febry 21st [I7761 last Evening the Secret Committee met, Signed the Contract &amp;c which I shall Enclose to you, they have likewise Drawn an order for the money, which order I have taken and have given my Recept that I have Recd it for you, but how to Conduct the affair I know not, whether the treasurers, if I should Desire it, will be willing to Deliver me the money as I have no order from you to Receive it I know not and if I Should Receive it without order, and Send it Down &amp; any mishap befall it, I may bring my Self into Difficulty, without any prospect of advantage, How or when I shall have a Safe op- ertunity to send Down So large a sum as 30,000 Dollars I know not; the man that Mr [John] Hancock Expected is not Come and when he Does I arn un- certain whither he will be willing to take Charge of it, I Could wish you had given some more particular orders about the money as I am puzzeled how to Conduct for the best. I shall write you again in a few Days. ... I Believe it is Certain the British parliament, has ordered all american vessels to be Seized, as you will See by the publick papers, two of the out- ward bound vessels fitted out by the Secret Committee, for the purpose of necessaries, are taken and Carried into the west Indies, the master of one has got back. Vn short we have nothing to Expect from Brittain, but war &amp; Bloodshed, notwithstanding the pretence of sending Comissioners here to treat. I am this Day informed that a petition to the Congress, is Signing fast by the Inhabitants of this City, for Leave to fit out privateers, and make re- prisals on all Brittish vessels, to indemnify them for the Losses they have Sustained by the Depredations of Brittish men of war. Indeed it seems very hard that Brittain is Seizing all american vessels and the americans are </P>

<P>Josiah Bartlett </P>

<P>P S by the latest account it seems the parliament has altered their measure of treating, and the Comisrs are to treat with Each Colony Seperate, which will Certainly, and unfailingly, Destroy the whole, for I am Sure no Colony will, at this time, treat Seperately; I think I may venture to Engage for New hampshire. </P>

<P>[Extract] off Norfolk, 21 Feb. 1776. What was left of Norfolk is now totally destroyed by the Rebels and the inhabitants of that and Princess Anne County ordered away from their plantations. We are informed Sir Peter Parker is on his way out, is to have the command here and convoys out a number of troops their appearance here will soon alter the face of affairs. Genl. Clinton called at N.York. It seems Gen. Lee was dispatched to the South when they knew Gen. Clinton departure. Lee had got to New York and is expected here. Washington has sent expresses to inform that a number of ships had left Boston and it was expected they were coming South. I believe it is so because last night old Coll. Colvin was brought on board this ship, there were some Rebel officers with him in a flag or truce boat from Hampton. Capt. Hammond stop'd them on board the Roebuck and sent to his Lo[s]p. It seems they have a letter from the Committee of Safety offering to lay down their arms if all the acts of Parliament are re- pealed that have been made since 1763. If this is all it is doing nothing. </P>

<P>Gent -Portsmo, Feby 22d, 1776. I've just enroled near one hundred of men in the ship yard,2 have or- der'd every man to attend the muster at an appointed day with a good fire arm, powder and ball, some of which are already completely equipp'd; but as there is no powder to be had only what is in publick stores, would submit it to the consideration of the Honble Committee, whether it would not [be] best to order that those men who are not supplied already be furnished by the publick, when occasion requires, or if tho't best for each to appear with one half pound powder in his horn, for which a receipt to be taken, and if its not Return'd or made use of against the enemy, to pay double of the value at this time, which I will stop out of their wages, which I think will effectually prevent wast, and put those who have no powder upon the same footing with those who have bro't their own amunition. I think I may with safety, serve the Colony in this matter, and not the least interfere with the Continental business. Should be glad to have some answer from the Honble Committee relative to this matter, as I've order'd every man to be ready for musterg at such a day, and should be glad to have every man furnished. I am with great Respect [kc.] Jno Langdon In case of failure they are to be Dismist the yard. </P>

<P>Sir -Information is given to us, that a brigantine and a sloop now appear upon the coast. We have therefore ordered Capt. [Thomas] Smith, in the pilot boat Hibernia, immediately to reconnoitre and bring.in those vessels if practicable -possibly they may be cruizers. You are to get the scooner De-fence as speedily as possible under sail, and to proceed, according to circum- stances, to attack and seize either or both those vessels, and conduct them within this bar, or to some other safe harbour, if practicable; or retreat and cover the pilot boat, if in your apprehension the enemy is too formidable for your power, which must be left to your fortitude and discretion. If more men than are now on board the Defence are necessary, give us immediate notice, and how many; but let no time be lost. </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 39 </P>

<P>Charles-Town, So. Carolina, </P>

<P>Feb. 22d, 1776. Gentlemen -We received your favor of -the 5th inst. by Mr. Barnley, and having duly considered the contents, and had reference to your articles of agreement with that gentleman, we find that we are prohibited by a resolu- tion of the Continental Congress from suffering exportation of produce from this colony, except to some other of the united colonies or to part of the same colony, unless such exportation to be on public account or in re- turn for the means of defence actually imported. We beg leave to refer you to the particular resolution by which we apprehend we are restricted, dated the -;a copy of which we here inclo~e.~ </P>

<P>We have, under that resolution, made several contracts. Our orders and conditions are: </P>

<P>The cargo to be purchased on the best terms for, and to be paid for by the public, to be sold at some foreign market, the nett proceeds to be laid out in gunpowder, saltpetre, good muskets, with bayonets fixed; in failure of these, wool and cotton cards, coarse foreign cloths, blankets, coarse linens, sail cloth, Russia canvas, writing and printing paper, nails. of all sorts, spades, good musket locks, pins, needles, whip and hand-saw, gunsmiths and other files, tin plates. We always give special charges against purchasing slight muskets and fuzils. </P>

<P>If powder, saltpetre and muskets are purchased and imported, we allow 50 per cent. on the purchase, and insure the vessel out and home, at a reasonable computed 'value. This is to be in full satisfaction of freight, commission, and all other charges whatsoever, except such as are incidental to the bare loading and delivery, as wharfage and porterage, and unavoid- able duties, if any, and so in proportion on the value, if only part of the proceeds are invested in those prime articles; if other articles are purchased, we allow 60 per cent on the purchase in lieu of freight and charges as afore- said, but we do not insure the vessel. </P>

<P>It may possibly happen that none of those articles may be at market, and that the master of the vessel, or agent, may be reduced to a necessity of making returns in gold or silver; in such case, we allow a freight of £4 Barbadoes money per ton of 3000 Ib. rice, together with commission on the invoice here and the salks abroad, and incidental petit charges and no more, not commissions or freight on the money, nor insure the vessel. </P>

<P>By this plan, the public may reap an advantage from the low price of </P>

<P>-</P>

<P>commodities here, as they are to be entitled to the whole nett proceed of sale, on which an allowance of 50 per cent. will be very considerable to the owner of the vessel, considering he runs no risk of losing more than an ex- pected profit. This security will induce him to purchase powder, kc., in preference to other goods, and the proposed commission on goods will lead </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>him to prefer a purchase of such to making his return in gold or silver, by which he can make at best but a common saving voyage; and we do not suf- fer those vessels to clear out at the Custom House. </P>

<P>We wish these hints may prove of any use to you. If you think proper to renew your engagement with Mr. Barnley, and will give orders to load his vessel with rice on public account, we will readily grant a permit. You may pay the persons from whom the rice will be purchased, or we will do so, and receive a reimbursement at some future time. It will afford us great satis- faction upon every occasion to promote the interest and safety of your col- only, which are closely united with the welfare of this. </P>

The whole of the said report being gone through, the Congress came to the following resolutions thereupon: That, of the matrosses on the present establishment, the seamen in the colony navy, and the matrosses and seamen expected to arrive here, from the New-England colonies and other parts, in the whole upwards of nine hun- dred men, two hundred may, if found necessary, be established as marines on board the navy. Resolved, That all the regular forces of this colony, both naval and mil- itary, shall, upon any emergency, and when the Congress or Council of . Safety shall think proper, be liable, under either of their order and direc- tion, to serve and act in any part of this, or of a neighbouring colony. </P>

<P>Sir Exeter Feb 23d 1776. We have just rec'd your favor of the 22d inst, and with pleasure con- sider the arming your Carpenters,' as a fresh demonstration of your zeal and attachment to the cause of your country. The delivering out [of] the very small public store of powder we are possessed of, a half pound to each man not provided, we ~vould cheerfully do, was it not that the Militia all round Portsmouth who have often applied for the same and professed themselves ready to move on an alarm at the least warning, have been denied, fearing our small Scanty magazine would be emptied in that way and perhaps wasted. We are sensible the danger of it's being misapplied is not so great with your Carpenters, in the way you mention, as with the Militia, but if as we have denied them, if we should now deliver some to the Carpenters, the country would be in an uproar and perhaps injure the cause. Therefore we have directed Major Gains, the Quarter Master, in case of an alarm and appearance of going into immediate action to deliver each of your Carpen- ters not supplied half a pound. And as the powder house is so nigh your </P>

<P>yard, we imagine there can be no great inconvenience, in omitting it now, and so escape the censure of the Militia. In behalf of the Committee, I am [kc.] Meshech Weare </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 </P>

<P>of your way for St Nichola Mole &amp; on your arival there you be well assured if Capt [Nathaniel] Silsbee is gone to Jamaica, if he is not gone you had best to tarry there a short Time to wait for him, or if Capt [Nathan] Nichols is there advise with him in what manner you had best to Proceed to git to him, if he should be gone down, if he is gone I think best either to leave your Schooner in the Mole &amp; hire a Passage to Jamaica in any small Vessell down, or to go down the No side with your own Schooner &amp; to be set ashore at Port-Antones &amp; to let your Vessell put to see again &amp; to meet you at some other harbour in ten days from that time or iny other way you like Better. If you go to Jamaica in any other Vessell take your Regestirs with you as I sup- pose Silsbee will Obtain a Clearance for you, Espetially at the Northside at Lucea, if you can get a Clearance at Jamaica it will be as well to Clear for Cape Besue in Nova-scotia, but I hope and trust you will meet Silsbee at the Mole &amp; whether their or at Jamaica take his advice in all Matters relateing to the Voyage &amp; if it turns out Rong I shall be satisfied, I suppose y[ou]r Dominica Regest[e]r &amp; a Clearance from the Mole with goods Consign'd to any Merchant at any Part of Hallafax Goverment, might be safe but all the Papers must agree, if you should get taken 20 leags to the westward of your Port &amp; had not made the land I suppose you safe &amp; so think you had best to come but a small distance to the Eastward of Georges Bank &amp; so over the Northshore, but if you meet thick Easterly weather when you are to the Northward of Georges Bank, think it best to run home bold to the land, &amp; the first Harbour you get into if to the westward let me know of your ar- rival, if you obtain an EngIish CIearance be sure you have not the least thing but what is Clear'd as Capt [David] Ingersoll lost his Vessell for haveing but 3 barrils ~u\gar more then he had in his Clearance, but I do not Much ex- pect you will be able to get the Clearance, &amp; as you hav[e] an Order on Sils- bee for so much Money as you &amp; he may think can be layd out to Advantage 1 would have you advise with him about it, as I have wrote him my mind fully on the affairs, if you go to Jamaica there will be great Enquirey for news from home, but do not be know[n] there by any of them. Your Schooner is Insured from Salem to the Mole &amp; while trhere for ten pc but if she goes to Jamaica it is to be 5 pc more, so that the Insurance down will be </P>

<P>not less than 100 Dollers, so that I had much Rather you should hire a Ves- sell if it costs as much or more, but take y[ou]r Regesters with you &amp; be very Careful1 of your Money in comming as a Passenger with straingers, &amp; should think you had best take your own Crew or Part of them &amp; keep all your affairs to yourself &amp; for your Goverment I have sett the Price of Goods here </P>

<P>Salem [23] Feby 1776 The above is Copy of what 1 wrote you by way of Cape-Ann since which I have got leave to send Capt Hallet in the Nancy to let you know my mind about the times and what I think about your comming home &amp;now I Cannot write Positively but still think it not safe for you to come home with the Vessell. I have given Capt Hallet an Order on you for so much Money as you &amp;he shall think Can be layd out to good Advantage on my acc[oun]t say from five hundred to one Thousand sterling &amp; I shall depend on your ad- viseing him in all matters relateing to it &amp; of his comming to the Eastward in his way home he has no Clearance &amp; therefore suppose it not safe to go to Jamaica for a Clearance but you will judge of that, I do not mean to load his Vessell too deep he has two Regeste[rs] &amp; if you think it safe &amp; </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 </P>

<P>Best he may go down to Jamaica as from the Mole in Ballast belonging to Dominica, but I suppose he may be as safe with a Cargo of Molasses, Sugar, Cocoa, &amp; Cotton from the Mole without any Clearance at all, Provided it is Consigned to some Merchant at Cape besue, &amp; the French Clearance to agree with that as any Clearance at all the reaison of my wanting his Pap- ers so is I think if he is taken there he must be safe if he is leased to that Goverment, &amp; if not taken if he meets an Easterly wind, as it will be the Right season of the year for it he will stand a good chance to get into some of our Harbours, on the North shore, &amp; I am well asured if he dos well, &amp; has a good Cargo of Goods, he will make not less than 100 pc[t] after Paying the Insurance &amp; Charge which at Present is high, I have insured the Schooner out &amp; while she lays at the Mole against all Risques at ten pct at Present I have not made any Insurance home, as I suppose I cannot at this time get it done under 25 pc &amp; shall not make any at Present for by the last acc[oun]ts from England it sems they are tired of this unnatural War, but of that you can f[o]rm a much better Judgment than we can here as it is but Seldom wee have accounts that can be depended on, if you have a good op- pertunity in 4 or 5 Vessel[ls] from the Mole to ship Goods so as to divide the Interest you may ship most or all your Stock home to me, but no Indigo, &amp; then you may settle your affairs in Jamaica, if you think there is any danger of a French or Spanish War, if not I shall be very Easey about it, but be sure do nothing Contrary whereby I ~[hould] have any Reaison to be though[t] hard of, the Reaison of my Make[ing] any mention of your Schooner Load- ing with Salt is the Committees in all ouer Towns are very exact, &amp; the more so of such Vessells as there is the least suspition of ther haveing ever gone Rong, &amp; they suppose your Vessel1 has &amp; Partly for that Reason I am against her corneing, &amp; if she does come think it best with Salt from Turks Island for Boston, &amp; so into any Harbour near, Salt is now none at market &amp; is worth 301. 8[d] p [bag] or you may Charter the Schooner for any Voyage you like, Provided it is not to the Northward &amp; if you &amp; Capt Hallet Can ag[ree] you may take his Schooner &amp; Come home &amp; he to go in yours but the times at Present are such that I in my own mind Cannot determin, what will be for the best, &amp; must therefore leave it wholey to you, not doubting but it will be Conduct[ed] with Care &amp; should any thing turn out Rong, I have no doubt but I shall be satisfied with all your Conduct, as I have not the least doubt but all you do will be done for the best if you have a mind to send any Interest of your own home[in]the Schooner I have no objection, there is but very few art[icles] you can Purchase at the Mole but what will answer ~vel-gin, Brandy, &amp; all such things are wanted here -</P>

<P>Should Capt Nichols be at the Mole, I would have you all adv[ise] to- gather &amp; deterrnin what to do for the Best, what I have wrote I would have kept to yourself, &amp; not to have it made the least mention of in Jamaica, in regard to the Private[e]ring, Espetially, I should have wrote Nichols but did suppose he must be away belore the Nancy Could be there, I have Or- </P>

<P>dered Hallet to throw all the Papers Over in case he gets taken, &amp; would </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>have you Order the same in what you write by him home, but I do not think of loosing her as the Schooner Sails very fast -</P>

<P>If so large a fleet should come on this Co[a]st in the Spring as is talked of I should think it best not to ship so much Interest to the Northward as I should otherways but it is now said that Commissioners are appointed to come over to accomodate the affairs, but I fear it. -Should you think of Tar- rying in Jamaica wit11 the schooner, I think it best to discharge all hands ex- cept your Mate who I suppose to be John Shannon &amp; Mingo &amp; to keep them with you least any thing should happen to you, I shall write you again if I have any oppertunity, as I have already under Cover to Dolbear by way of Philadelphia, you may if theirs is no Prospect of a Settlement &amp; the Schoo- ner cannot be sold, send her for Mules to Gibralter &amp; so to Jamaica, or any other Island, not haveing any thing further to write at this time, I committ you to the Almightys Protection, not doubting but we shall once more carry on Business at Salem in Peace &amp; Safety </P>

<P>From y[ou]r Friend </P>

<P>Elias Hasket Derby </P>

<P>I have Rote you a long letter &amp; hope you will fully know my Mind by it wich is for you to keep most of the Interest in Your hands till You think the Danger not so much as at this time -if You Can get 30 or 40 Bags of Cotten at Jamaica or any where Else Ship it by Hallet as it is not Conterary to Congress -</P>

<P>who appears to be a Gentleman, &amp; a Veteran, Charectors you will esteem him for he has with him other recommendations to your Notice, from some of your Paris acquaintances; if I had never fallen out with Royalty for any other reason, I should detest it, upon the poor Barons account, for the Tyrannical treat- ment he has received from The King Prussia: -may he enjoy in This Land of Freedom that Comfort which has been denied him in Germany; &amp; may this Land continue to Embrace with her wonted Cordiality, every Oppress'd Subject from every other Quarter of The Globe -</P>

<P>Last Night our People surprised A Corporal, &amp; Two Sentrys of the Ene- mys, &amp; brought them this morning to head Quarters, they declare General Clinton took with Him when he Saild from Boston a considerable Quantity of Artillery, &amp; Artillery Men; besides The Detachment of The Troops; this convinces me that he design'd to take post at New York 'from whence, as I hinted to you in my last Letter, I am satisfied the Enemy meant to com- mence their Summer Operations: as The Baron goes by Providence, &amp; that way to New York, I shall not write anything Further to day. a few days </P>

<P>The Memorial, Remonstrance and Petition of the Freemen and Others, Inhabitants of the Town of Newport, in legal Meeting assembled, humbly sheweth, </P>

<P>That, as it is the distinguishing and unalienable Privilege of every English Subject, to Petition those, who are vested with the legislative Authority of Government, for that Protection, which from the Laws and the Constitution, he hath a clear and indisputable Right to expect and demand; We therefore presume, humbly, to exercise that Privilege, and are extremely concerned, </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 
</P>

<P>that the peculiar Circumstances of Difficulty and Distress, which we, your Memorialists, have had to encounter for Months past, reduce us to the Ne- cessity of making such frequent Applications to your Honors. </P>

<P>As we wish and mean to make this Application as little tedious as possi- ble, and unimbarrassed with the enumeration of unnecessary Facts, tve will lead your Honors Attention no further back, then your last Session, from which Period, notwithstanding your Honors generous Intention towards us, in permitting the Town Council to supply the Ships of War, in this Harbor, with fresh Provisions, for their own Consumption, designing thereby to pur- chase the Security of this Town, we have perceived, with the deepest Anxiety and Concern, the dark and alarming Train of Calamities to in- crease, with the gradual Approach of that Ruin, which Nothing but your Honors benign Intervention can ward off. </P>

<P>In every Application that we have made to your Honors, for Liberty to supply the Ships of War in this Harbol with Beer &amp;c, we had not only in View the Preservation of the Town from immediate Destruction, but the ad- ditional Advantage of obtaining Permission for the free Passage of the Mar- ket, Wood and Ferry Boats, to and from this Town, and which was clearly your Honors Intentions, by the Tenor of your first Vote; but, notwithstand- ing Capt. Wallace had on his Part granted Passes for that Purpose, we, your Memorialists, were unexpectedly deprived of many and singular Benefits, which we are confident your Honors intended tve shou'd enjoy, as we cou'd not obtain Permission for the free passing of the aforesaid Boats, until the Second Day of this Month. But, that your Honors may have a more com- prehensive Knowledge of our Negotiations with General [William] West, we beg leave to refer you to the Letters which passed between him and the Town upon that Subject, and make no doubt, your Honors will pay them that Attention which their Importance demands. </P>

<P>Your Honors, in Order the more effectually to Guard against Supplies not warranted by Law, and to prevent Intelligence being carried to the Ships of War &amp;c, detrimental to the Common Cause of America, passed an Act, and punished the Offence with Death: This we perfectly acquiesced in, and used every Precaution in our Power to prevent a violation of the Act. We knew the Ground we stood upon, and the Tenure by which we held our Lives: But the Hopes of Safety and Peace, however flattering then, were but of short Duration, for General West in his Letter of the 23d, of last Month expressly declared &quot;that if any Vessel or Boat shou'd pass so near the Ships, as to be hailed, they shou'd be immediately taken up and dealt with as Persons giving Intelligence to the &quot;Ministerial Fleet&quot; -A few Days after this, we saw, with Concern, the Master of a small Boat, from North Kings- town, arrested by a File of Soldiers, carried to Middletown, and there detained lor a Night by Military Force, without the Aid or Countenance of the Civil Authority: This unfortunate Man had conformed to the Law, and conscious of the Rectitude of his Intentions, he thought himself justifia- ble, in transporting the Necessaries of Life to this Town; but, unhappily, he violated Orders, which were never published, and found himself involved in </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>a supposed Crime. -Since this, we have also seen Proceedings of a similar </P>

<P>Nature, which, if not discountenanced by your Honors, must prove Fatal to </P>

<P>the Inhabitants; because, if those Persons, who supply this Town with the common Necessaries of Life, are subject to military Prosecutions, upon a mere Suspicion of their having departed from their Duty, it must effectually discourage all Intercourse with this Town from the Continent, which, from our being situated on an Island, hath already produced such a Scarcity of many of the most essential Articles that tend to render Life comfortable, especially Fuel, that Numbers of your Memorialists daily experience the most distressing Necessity. But with still greater Concern &amp; Anxiety, we, your Memorialists have beheld a large Body of armed Men, march into this Town enter the Dwellings of some of the Inhabitants, contrary to the Rights of the Subject, as Established by Law, seize the Proprietors, and hold them during Pleasure, under military Duresse, out of the Body of the County: These Proceedings, may it please your Honors, are so destruc~ive to our Civil Liberties, that we consider it, as our bounden Duty, publicly to remon-strate against them; For, shou'd we supinely bear, such alarming Encroachments, upon our sacred and invaluable Rights, we must inevitably forfiet that Character we are solicitous to sustain. -In this opin- ion we think ourselves fully supported by the Proceedings of the Honorable Continental Congress, who with a Dignity and Integrity that will procure them immortal Honor, have expressly declared, &quot;That the Second great Right of the Subject is, that of Trial of Jury, which provides, that neither Life, Liberty nor Property can be taken from the Possessor, until Twelve of his unexceptionable Countrymen, and Ours, of his Vicinage, who from that Neighborhood may reasonably be supposed to be acquainted with his Char- acter, and the Characters of the Witnesses upon a fair Trial, and in full In- quiry Face to Face, in open Court, before as many of the People as chuse to attend shall pass their Sentence upon Oath against him [&quot;I. We entertain the highest Regard and Veneration for the Laws and Liberties of our Coun- try, and therfore to your Honors, as our Guardians and Protectors, we make this solemn Appeal, humbling beseeching your Honors at this Time'of Dan- ger and Difficulty to give such Orders to the Commanding Officers of the Troops stationed here, as may free us, your Memorialists, from the Appre- hensions of Martial Law. </P>

<P>We, your Memorialists, do not wish for any particular Benefits, which may prove injurious to the common Interest of America; but as the Destruc- tion of this Town, in our Opinion, must give a Wound, to the united Ef- forts of the Colonies, for the Preservation of their inestimable Rights, we beg leave to suggest, that if the Army is permitted to enter the Town, it will bring on its immediate Ruin, without their having it in their Power to an- noy the Ships of War, as we are accessible at every Part; A Calamity we sincerely deprecate, and which, we flatter ourselves, your Honors will give the necessary Instructions to prevent. </P>

<P>We cannot sufficiently express our Gratitude for the Attention your Honors have manifested towards this Town, and had we have realized those FEBRUARY 1776 51 </P>

<P>Benefits and Advantages which your Honors undoubtedly intended we shou'd have enjoyed from the Truce with Capt Wallace, such Ruin and Devastation in Buildings and Fences wou'd not have taken Place, thro' the Want of Fuel, but unhappily, many of the Inhabitants have been compelled, thro' extreme Necessity to commit such Waste, as in any Situation, not so distressing, wou'd have been highly Criminal. </P>

<P>As Poverty and Distress, are the first Objects that present themselves in passing thro' the Streets of this once flourishing Metropolis; And as the very Being and Existence of the Town depends, principally, upon supplying the Ships Stationed in this Harbor with fresh Beef &amp;c, Your Honors cannot but mingle your Anxiety with ours, and we trust, will go as far in relieving us as may appear consistent with the General Safety; We therefore, in behalf of ourselves, the Common Cause, and that of Humanity and Benevolence, most humbly Pray your Honors, that you wou'd be pleased to take the Premises into your serious Consideration, and Order, that this Town, for its immedi- ate Preservation, be permitted to supply the Ships stationed here with fresh Beef &amp;c, for their own immediate Consumption, under the Cognizance and Direction of the Town Council: And that the Commanding Officers of the Troops in this Colony, be Instructed, to permit the Ferry and Market Boats, with Provisions and Fuel for this Town, to pass and repass, without being subjected to unnecessary Restrictions and Conditions: And, as it may be- come highly Necessary in this Time of Difficulty and Danger, to have some Persons appointed to go onboard the Ships of War, that may from Time to Time be in this Harbor, your Memorialists also Pray, that your Honors would be pleased to authorize such Persons, Inhabitants of this Town, as in your Wisdom you may think suitable, to go onboard such Ships, upon any important urgent Occasion under the Direction of the Town-Council; And we, your Memorialists, as in Duty bound, shall ever Pray kc. -</P>

<P>[Extract] Albany Feby 23d 1776. . . . No Time is also to be lost in forwarding the Cannon and what Mili- tary Stores there are at Tyconderoga and Crown point; they will however be of little Service unless a considerable Quantity of powder is immediately sent: What is gone is very trifling. On Board of the Vessels which were taken near Montreal on the 19th of ~ovkmber, 760 Barrels of pork and 675 of Flour were found -A Quantity sufficient of the first Article to have served 2000 Men to the 3d Instant of the other to the 22d Ult: -a considerable Quantity had been taken a Month before at Chamble; a large Quantity was at St John's; Bedels and Warner's Detachments had provisions bought for them; much has been bought since the Surrender of Montreal, hence a Waste or Embezzlement must have taken place -I can easily account for the Loss by only imputing it to the Inabil- ity of the Commissarys and the culpable Inattention of the Officers -I gave Orders last Year, which if they had been complyed with would have pre- vented this Evil Ek Extra Expence in sending the Supplies -. . . I am this Moment informed that some Nails are arrived from Canada, and a considerable Quantity are on the Way. The Shipwrights to construct the Scows on Hudsons River are not yet arrived -These Vessels will be greatly wanted. </P>

<P>The Mercury frigat, capt. Graham [Alexander Graeme] (former [John] Macartney, who is gone to England) having general [Henry] Clinton and lord [Hugh] Percy on board, and two transports, with between 3 and 400 troops, chiefly light infantry of the 4th and 44th regiments, and a number of officers belonging to the 16th and 40th regiments, besides some engineers, are arrived in Hampton road, from Boston; since which they have been joined by the Kingfisher, and four or five tenders, who now lie off Hampton, and it is supposed are bound up Potowmack, or for North Carolina, where some disturbances have broke out among the people who lately styled them- selves regulators. </P>

<P>Capt. Montague, we hear, is promoted to the command of the Mercury and capt Graham succeeds him in the Kingfisher. Two brigs went up Norfolk river, accompanied by some tenders, a few days before the arrival of the Mercury. </P>

<P>It is said that troops with lord Dunmore, to the amount of 500, are in- trenched at Portsmouth, and that a considerable number of our people are intrenching some little distance below them. The Roebuck is gone up to Norfolk, where the Liverpool and Otter, with the ships Dunmore and Wil- liam, a number of tenders, and other craft, still remain. </P>

<P>A considerable quantity of gunpowder (5000 wt. it is said) with osnabrugs and other linen, is safely landed in North Carolina. The ship Rockingham is now in Hampton road, with upwards of 60 passengers, bound for Glasgow. </P>

<P>[Extract] Wilmington 23rd Febry 1776 Gentlemen On the 9th Instant upon the Arrival of an Express that the Reg- ulators and highlanders were in Arms with an intention to join Govr [Jo- siah] Martin. I had Notice from the Committee of Wilmington to have my regiment in readiness, and soon after, Orders from Col. [James] Moore to prepare for marching against the insurgents -My Zeal for the [illegible] com- mon Cause in some measure surmounted every difficulty -I dispatched part of the [regiment] and Captain Youngs rangers, by Order of the Committee to [?]Horses Carts Boats &amp;c for the service of the military, and during up-wards of eighty hours of severe Service Night &amp; day with the Ass[is]tance of the Regulars &amp; minute men whilst they were here, happily effected every- thing necessary The Two companies of minute men in this County, and somewhat above eighty others under the command of John Ashe, Esqr, and stiling </P>

<P>themselves Volunteers, together with a considerable number of disaffected Persons, reduced the Number of fighting Men in my County so much, that it was thought necessary with the small Number that remained, that I should stay behind, to protect the Town &amp; adjacent County from any insults that might be offered in the Absence of the Troops by the Ships of </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>War. unequal as I know myself, and as indeed I must necessarily be, to any military command, I chearfully exerted myself to fill a department which of Course fell upon me and which there was not any other to undertake . . . </P>

<P>On Wednesday the 14th instant in the evening the committee rec'ed re- peated expresses from Brunswick that the Cruizer Sloop of War with a Tender had passed that Town, and was on her way up. We had then, in the general Confusion, no doubt but that the intention was to destroy Wil- mington, unless we Should submit to ignominio[us] terms. This opinion had such an instantaneous effect upon the Inhabitants, who had a number of enemies among them, that they, as if by concert, immediately began to remove their Effects. The Town is now almost cleared of all kinds of Goods, and of the women &amp; Children. Since that time I have been reinforced by Captain Clintons Company of minute Men from Duplin, a minute company from Onslow, and part of the Militia of this last County under the Com- mand of Col. [William] Cray. I have also had between 50 &amp; 60 Men under Major [Parker] Quince from Brunswick county, and with all those forces I have been almost constantly employed, in throwing up Breastworks on the principal Streets &amp; Wharfs and the hills above &amp; below the Town. these I shall soon have Compleated, so as to prevent the landing of any men from the Ships -I am making the necessary preparations for fire rafts and shall be able to make use of 'what swivels are mounted, and of a number of blunderbusses. But I am now assured the Ships never will venture to Wilmington. They too much dread the rifle men to approach us. The Cruizer and her tender attempted to go up the North West River, on the West side of the great Island, opposite to Town, but found there was not sufficient Water all the Way, and th[ere]fore returned. It is thought the in- tention was to favor the [Relgulators &amp; the highland banditti, whom they expected in Triumph, and to protect the Provision Boats which would Con- sequently come from Cross Creek for their Army and Ships. after the Cruizer Had fallen down below the Island, her people went several times on Shore at Mr [John] Ancrums Plantation, Carried off his live Stock and vegetables, and attempted to seize his Negroes, who fled to the woods. They have even taken away a parcel of printed Books, Old Cloths &amp;c &amp; threatened to burn the house. I therefore thought it necessary to dispatch Major Quince with his detachment to [proltect the inhabitants on the West Side of the River, &amp; I found that the more necessary, as Col. Davis of Brunswick County informed me yesterday, that there were 50 men from the Ships at the fort, pillaging the Inhabitants. Captn Dupre with only 15 Men arrived at Mr Ancrums plantation just as the Cruizer Boat was coming ashore the third time -fired up on them, which was returned, and kept up about a minute, when the Sailors pushed off with precipitation. we certainly did some execution, tho' they carried off their Men. The Cruizer fired three Guns without effect. Since this the ship is gone down below the flats </P>

<P>On Wednesday last, I reced intelligence that a boats crew from [the] Scorpion, which is also below the flats, went ashore on the East [side] of the River, and killed some hogs steer &amp;c -Captaia Clinton's minute men are </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 </P>

<P>gone down &amp; I make no doubt but with prud[ence] they will be able to seize the next party that presumes to come on Shore, as they are to remain there three days. I have got in confinement several tories and suspected Tories. Many of those still here had inrolled themselves with Col. Ashe, in order, as is believed, to skreen themselves from duty; but when the day of trial came they shrunk back -That Gentlemen went so far as to inlist an Open Enemy who had been disarmed by the Committee and even presumed to require his Arms- It was not however thot proper to comply with this preposterous requisition. on the Contrary the Committee disarmed every man who would not take the Test of the Cong~ess in form of an Oath -The Neutrals as they call themselves, have been forced greatly against their inclinations to work at the breastworks </P>

<P>24th February </P>

<P>The Ships of War, which threatened us for sometime, are all fallen down to Brunswick. Their people have been so much harrassed on both Sides of the River by the Riflemen, that I immagin their station became uneasy; but I am inclined to believe they lost all hopes of the arrival of their friends, and probably might receive intelligence (notwithstanding all the precaution that was used) [thalt their friends were so situated that it was scarcely possible for them [to come.] I have upwards of twenty tories in Custody &amp; expect a considerable number more to morrow.

<P>23 Febry 1776 -Dear Sir, I hope this will find you safe arrived at Cape Fear, which will give me great pleasure to hear. I had a very tedious passage here of thirty days having nothing but hard gales of Wind, most of the passage, The Transports parted with us in a very severe Gale the night after we left Boston -They arrived here a week after us, </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>We have found this province in the utmost confusion which we did not expect when we left Boston, which has frustrated us in our plan of getting a Supply of Provisions for Boston, </P>

<P>The Rebels to the amount of two or three hundred have taken posses- sion of the Town of Savannah &amp; have erected two Batteries of eighteen Pounders upon a Bluff Land forty feet high which a Ship passing or repass- ing to Town must go within Pistol Shot off, they have likewise sunk a Ves- sel in the narrowest part of the Channell, which prevents any Ship of Force going to the Town, there is fifteen Sail of Merchant Ships above the Town mostly loaded with Rice -If we coud get possession of them, they woud be a sufficient quantity to supply Boston or any other port where they may be wanted for the use of the Kings Troops </P>

<P>To come at these Ships we must get possission of the Town &amp; distroy their batteries, but to effect that I am afraid we have not a sufficient force But if it is found practicable we will attempt it, but to Insure success a greater force shoud be sent us, </P>

<P>I woud sincerely recommend to your Judgment to send a small force here, In that case If it cou'd be sent, I coud promise to keep this post open, by which means a Constant Supply of Provisions coud be sent to any part of the Continent without depending upon its being sent across the Atlantick </P>

<P>I will not enlarge upon this Subject as Sr James Wright has fully done it in his Dispatches to you </P>

<P>If we find it prudent to attack the Town with the small force we have, &amp; succeed, &amp; to evacuate it afterwards, it would involve the King's Service &amp; Servants in greater difficultys than what they were upon our Arrival, you are Sensible the Orders Major Grant is under is to return Immediately to Bos- ton </P>

<P>Sir James Wright is retired from the Town; he &amp; his Family are now on board of the Scarborough </P>

<P>He can never think of returning there except he has a sufficient force to protect him, he thinks five hundred Men with two ships of War in the harbour, woud keep possession of the Town, &amp; most likely the whole Prov- ince. </P>

<P>I hope therefore upon the rekeipt of this you will be so good as to Dis- patch something to us to let us know, wether any force may be expected, but these Circumstances I must intirely refer to your better Judgment. </P>

<P>And only wish I coud Co'operate with you in any respect concerning the Distress'd State, of the Kings affairs in this Country I am Dear sir [kc.] Andw Barkley </P>

<P>In my passage here I took a Schooner from Salem, bound to South Carolina, with about Eight hundred pound Continental Money to purchase a Cargoe of Rice for the Rebel Army at Cambridge which I have got in my posses- sion, I likewise took a Sloop off this Harbour, from StaCroix, having </P>

<P>No 26 Bermuda febry 23d 1776 My Lord Under the charge and care, of the Revd Mr Lyttleton, I send your Lordship several Dispatches; which I hope hath reach your Lordships hand, to Inform your Lordship that the People here, had Chosen Delegates (or Deputies,) and had Petitioned the Congress at Philadelphia. And that some evil minded People, had prevented the Owner of a Ves- sel, to fulfill his engagement to me, to hire His Vessel, to inform General [Thomas] Gage, of the Robbery committed, on the powder Magazine, in the night of the 14th of August. And the Attempt made to detain or stop a Sloop, I had engaged and hired to go to Boston, to carry the Intelligence of the loss of the Powder, and to forward letters, by way of Boston to your Lordship. And on the 3d of September, the Master of another Sloop, I had en- gaged, with only three Negroes, got under Sail, and put to Sea, when about 16, or eighteen People, and two of them were Delegates, and three of them were assembly men, took a Boat and pursued the Sloop, and the wind being at that time light, it seems they got up with the Sloop, and four or five white men, got on board, and asked the Captain for letters, and upon his answer- ing that He had not any (which was true, for my Negro had the letters) they beat and abused the Captain, but the Wind springing up pretty fresh, they got into their Boat, and returned into Harbour: and the Sloop made Sail, in obedience to a Signal by a fire I made from the Hill, and carried my Dispatches Safe to Boston. And did not wait for Mr Lyttleton, who was to have gone in the Sloop. I have been in constant expectation, of having some Support, either by the arrival of Some Soldiers, or a Sloop of War but I am disappointed hith- erto. And as most of the Assembly Men were Delegates and Some of them, had acted in that audacious manner; to go in pursuit of the Vessel, that I had sent, with Government Dispatches, I have been obliged to adjourn the </P>

<P>Assembly, from time, to time, as I thought, it would be very improper, to Suffer them, to Act in both Capacities, as assembly Men and deputies; espe- cially as some of them had acted so audaciously. And having received, nei- ther any Orders, or any Support, I Dissolved the General Assembly, on the </P>

<P>The Committee with pleasure will undertake &amp; perform all in their Power -&amp; can engage to purchase the necessary Articles wanted, except Gunpowder -Of that essential Article, they with reluctance say, not a Cask can be procured here at any rate -The pressing demands of this Town have called for every Exertion in their power to raise Monies, notwithstanding the Town is greatly in debt, not being able to furnish enough to pay the nec- essary current Services -therefore to make it possible to comply wth the aforesd Resolve, the Committee humbly hope the honble Council will fur- nish them by the Bearer Capt Michael Hodge one of their Members, with as much Money as the present Occasion calls for -Which by a moderate Calcu- lation for two Months Cruize only, with the fixing the Vessels will amount to five hundred pounds lawful1 money -exclusive of the cost of Gunpowder </P>

<P>(which is not to be had here) &amp; of which Capt Obrien thinks there ought to be five hundred pounds weight beside one hundred &amp; twenty pounds now on board -The Committee apprehend that the fifty Men for each Vessel1 or any considerable number of them cannot be found in this Town -owing to a large number being in the Continental Army, &amp; to several Privateers out on Cruises -Capt Obrien says he can make up the Deficiency in the East- ward Harbour, if your Honours think it proper to let him depart hence without his full Complement -As Capt Obrien must probably collect his Men from thence, &amp; his present Officers, whom he approves of may be most </P>

<P>COPY/ Sir, I beg leave to inclose herewith a Copy of the Letter, which I did myself the honor of mentioning to you lately to have written to Admiral Graves rel- ative to the State of New Hampshire; LBy several Accounts from that Province I learn that the People are making many Preparations and daily erecting Works of Strength on the different Islands at the Mouth of Piscata- qua River, where a Body of Troops is kept to obstruct and prevent Access for the King's Ships that Way, the only navagable Inlet, into the Province;-That they had entirely.subverted His Majesty's Authority and proceeded to establish and administer a new mode of Government of their own Formation, enforcing Obedience to their Measures by Violence and Outrage on the Persons and Properties of Individuals, who, if not acquiesc- ing in Rebellion, are unavoidably exposed to destructive Resentments, being wholly destitute of any Protection or Defence, of which Circumstance the Rebels have also availed themselves in fitting out Armed Vessels from Portsmouth to commit Depredations on the Transports bound for Boston. </P>

<P>Permit me, Sir, to assure you of my utmost Attention and Readiness to- ward restoring the King's Authority in that Government, and Zeal to apply </P>

<P>[Extract] COPY . Halifax 25th February 1776. -I thought it my Duty to give you the Earliest Notice, that proper steps might be taken to prevent, if possible a Descent on this Province, from that Quarter [Canada], which unless opposed, they might easily effect, if they [the Americans] are in possession of Quebec, they will thereby, have in their hands a Frigate, a sloop of War, and the Gaspee Brig, and therefore will re- quire a considerable Naval Force to oppose them: I apprehend they will not be able to leave Quebec, till the first of May unless there should be an early Spring, the Navigation of the Gulph is free about a fortnight before the Riv- er of Canada is open, and as the places of Descent must be either in the Bay of Verte, Tatamagouch, or Pictou Harbour, a Course of Shore about twenty Leagues. Ships Stationed between St John's Island, and that part of this Country, would effectually prevent it. </P>

<P>Dear Sir New York Feby 25: 1776 The enclosed Affidavits were this day Delivered to me, 'by Mr Michael Kearney, who was proprietor of the Boat York of Amboy; which was im- pressed into the Continental Service; and made Use of in taking the Ship Blue Mountain Vally; and which Boat it seems is Seized and detained by Capt [Hyde] Parker [Jr.] as a prize, on the.pretence of her having been em- ployed on that Service. I have encouraged Mr Kearney to hope that the Congress will not Suffer his private property to be Injured on this Occasion and that his loss will be made up to him out of the proceeds of the Ship &amp; Cargoe. I must beg the favour of you to lay his Case before Congress, and to Obtain their final Answer on this Matter, as soon as possible as his At- tendance at philadelphia will tend to increase his damage. I am [&amp;c.] Stirling. </P>

<P>CAPTAIN HYDE PARKER, JR., R.N., TO VICE ADMIRAL MOLYNEUX</P>

<P>SHULDHAM </P>

<P>COPY Sir, On the fifth of this Month Mr [Charles] Lee the Rebel General came into this City, with a large Body of Men said to Amount to Three Thou- sand, on the Eleventh they removed, all the Guns upon the lower Batteries up to what is called the Liberty Pole near the Barracks, this it was impossi- </P>

<P>ble for His Majesty's Ships to prevent, the Battery being so situated, that I Should have been Obliged to place one Ship in the North River, which at that time was Absolutely impossible; from there being a Strong Wind at WNWt and a Flood Tide, which effectually prevented our moving out of the East River; besides very large fields of floating Ice that would have Sub- jected the Ships to the most extreme danger of being carried Adrift. ,Firing upon the Town was judged by the Governor, General Clinton and myself, too Severe a Measure, being Confident that the Majority of the Citizens, par- ticularly those of Property are faithful to the King; neither was this Act of Violence, an Act of the City's, but of the Rebels who have invaded it, as ap- pears by the Minute of the Committee for removing the Records. I must Sir, beg leave to remark, that I feel myself in a very difficult Situation to know how to Act, Convinced as I am of the Attachment to His Majesty of many Men of great Property in this Town, at the same time knowing that it is Garrisoned by Rebels. And they have even had the Audacity to place Centinels immediately before Me, which I could never Submit to, was I not 76 AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>persuaded that my firing upon them would involve the City in ruins, which I must confess I cautiously Avoid, being determined if possible to make the Act of committing Hostilities theirs and not Mine, I should hope I am doing right, and that this lenity on my side, may not be Misconstrued, as a want of Zeal in carrying on the King's Service. </P>

<P>We have had a most severe Winter during which it has been with the greatest difficulty we have maintained our Stations, this has not been done without the Ships Sustaining some damage, the Asia making Sixteen or Twenty Inches of Water in Twelve Hours, the Phoenix does not make Wa- ter but her Bottom is a good deal cut with Ice. On the Eleventh we hauled off from the Wharfs to which we had been fast ever since the Twenty Ninth of December. Our fasts to the Shore were watched by the Citizens, to pre- vent their being Cut by I11 disposed persons, until the Arrival of Lee. We did not haul off without great apprehensions of Ice, but after the taking away the Guns, I thought it prudent to have the Ships in a Situation to Act; Until the thirteenth our Minds were much Agitated for fear of the Ice, having had many large Fields come in upon us, but fortunately of no Substance. </P>

<P>On the Sixteenth Mr Clark the Officer Commanding the Armed Tender came and reported he had seen a great nu\mber of Armed Rebels upon ,the Bluff Point of Staten Island and that he imagined they were Fortifying; Upon this information I thought it my Duty to throw every Obstruction in the way of such an Undertaking; I therefore sailed with His Majesty's Ship under my Command to the Narrows, and Anchored close off the Point of Staten Island, lay there four or five Hours, but could not, either from the Mast Head, or from the Deck, discover any ground to be broke, or that there was any appearance of such an Intention. A great number of Armed Reb- els paraded about, but as I could not fire upon them with any certainty, I did not choose to accustom them to Cannon Shot, where there was so little probability of having any good effect, </P>

<P>. At the same time I moved down with the Phoenix, I ordered Captain Vandeput to move into the North River, and place himself in such a Situa- tion as to prevent the Rebels taking Post, upon either Governor's or Hang- man's Island. I am now laying in the Phoenix off of the Narrows, where nothing can pass but must come within reach of my Guns, nor can any thing move upon the Heights but must be seen from the Mast Heads. Should any attempt be made to Fortify, I shall endeavour to retard it as much as possible, but cannot flatter myself with a Hope of being able to Stop such Proceedings effectually the Land being above the height of my Tops. In this Situation I also Command the View of the Hook, and can see a great way to Sea; am therefore ready to dispatch the Armed Tender with Pilots to any Ship or Vessel that may be coming in. The Asia Commands the most Material passage up to the Town, and I am persuaded the Rebels never will dare to take possession of either of those Islands while she is able to keep her Station, which nothing but Ice can drive her from. </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 7 7 </P>

<P>Mr Lee much against the Inclination of the City, has cut off all supplies of Fresh Provisions; in return I have given Orders to Stop every necessary from going to it. It is reported and I have it from good Authority, that Lee means to Fortify the back part of the Town by Intrenchments, and to erect some Batteries upon the Heights to Obstruct the Passage of both Rivers; as yet nothing of that sort is begun, nor do I apprehend any Batteries he can erect will be of any great consequence while we are able to prevent his doing of it at the Two passes where the Ships now lye. </P>

<P>I was much hurt at the Rebels taking the Ship Blue Mountain Valley, One of those loaded with Coals, Porter &amp;ca for the Troops, but in that case was particularly unfortunate, having the day before she was taken, dis- patched a Lieutenant and fifteen Men in a Pilot Boat to the Hook, upon the report of a Ship being off; The Master on that day had stood off to Sea, the Lieutenant therefore returned and reported that there was not any Vessel in sight; The day after the Ship stood in and was taken not without some Sus- picions of Treachery on the Master's side. The Sloop that brings you these Dispatches was the Vessel Seized upon as the Owners say for the above pur- pose, but I thought it a proper step to Seize upon her, leaving it to you to determine how far they can justify such an Act of Piracy. </P>

<P>Governor Tryon's Letter of the 19th of January was of such an Alarm- ing Nature, that I thought it my Duty to guard against the consequences if possible; I therfore Ordered the Cargo to be taken out of the James Schoon-er lately Seized, and Armed the said Schooner (having no small Vessel of the King's upon this Station) to enable her to be so placed as to give me the earliest Intelligence, should the Enemy attempt to Assenible the Vessels mentioned in the Letter; since the Hauling off the Ships from the Wharfs she has been of infinite Service as a Cruizer. </P>

<P>I am Sir, to Acknowledge the Receipt of your Orders by the Mercury, she Arrived here the third of this Month and Sailed the Eleventh, I com- pleated her Provisions for three Months, during her stay the three Trans- ports also Arrived and sailed with her. </P>

<P>On the Twentieth arrived the Harriot Transport from England bound to the Army with Coals, Porter &amp;ca she left England the Ninth of December; I propose as soon as she is refitted, pushing her, the Ship with Salt and the Sloop loaded with Naval Stores, on to Rhode Island, in hopes of their get- ting from thence a Convoy to Boston. </P>

<P>I have received a Letter from the Mayor of New York, dated the Twenty first Acquainting me that His Majesty's Ships are to be supplied as usual with Provisions; In consequence of which I have given orders to allow the Market Boats to pass to the City. </P>

<P>I am just now informed that the Rebels are pushing large Supplies of Flour &amp;ca from New York up Long Island Sound, this it is impossible for me to prevent; there is a Battery erected upon Long Island to defend the passage through Hell Gate, Another is began upon the Island of New York at a place called Benson's Bay, which will annoy any Vessels that may be coming hither through the Sound; as it is meant to defend the passage be- </P>

<P>78 	AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>tween Blackwell's Island and New York; It is also said Mr Lee's plan is to Fortify the Wharfs by raising Platforms in the Cellars, where he means to place Guns so as to be upon a height with the level of the River at high Wa- ter; but this will never Answer his purpose, as Ships of any size may come within Twenty Yards of the Wharfs. </P>

<P>On the 24th January, Died Mr George Clephan, Purser of His Majesty's Ship Asia; I appointed Mr John Saunders to be Acting in the Station until your Appointment shall take place. </P>

<P>In future I find by the Agent's Letter there is little probability of his being Able to Supply His Majesty's Ships with Rum, Pease, Beef or Pork; the first from it's not being allowed to be imported; the latter Articles from the Country People being terrified at the thoughts of being detected bring- ing them in. </P>

<P>I must Sir, beg leave to request you will be pleased to Order, by the first Man of War or Vessel that may come here, the stores for both Ships, ac- cording to the enclosed demands, the Asia being distressed for want of them, and the Phoenix in great want of many Articles, </P>

<P>We are much distressed for want of small Vessels, I should therefore hope Sir, you would be pleased to dispatch this Vessel to me Again; with such Orders as you may have for me. I have the Honor to be, Sir [kc.] </P>

<P>Sir Cambridge Feby. '26th 1776 I had the honour of addressing you on the 18 and 21st Instt by Mr [William] Hooper since which nothing material has occurred. We are making every necessary preparation for, taking possession of Dorchester Heights as soon as possible, with a .view of drawing the Enemy </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>out -How far our expectations may be answered, Time can only determine: But I should think, if any thing will Induce them to hazard an engagement, It will be our attempting to fortifty these heights, as on that event's taking place, we shall be able to command a great part of the Town, and almost the whole harbour and to make them rather disagreable than otherwise, provid- ed we can get a sufficient supply of what we greatly want. </P>

<P>Within these three or four days I have received Sundry accounts from Boston of such movements there, such as taking the Mortars from Bunker Hill, the putting them with several pieces of Heavy Ordnance on board of Ship with a quanting of Bedding; the Ships are taking in Water; the baking a large quantity of Biscuit kc, as to Indicate an embarkation of the Troops from thence -A Mr Ides who came out Yesterday says that the Inhabitants of the Town generally believe that they are about to remove either to New York or Virginia, and that every Vessel1 in the Harbour on Tuesday last was taken up for Government service, and Two Months pay advanced them -Whether they really Intend to embark, or whether the whole is a feint, is impossible for me to tell. However I have thought it expedient to send an express to General Lee to Inform him of it, in order that he may not be taken by Surprize (If their destination should be against New York) and continued him on to you -If they do embark, I think the possessing themselves of that place and of the North River, is the Object they have in view, thereby securing the communication with Canada, and rendering the Intercourse between the Northern &amp; Southern United Colonies exceedingly precarious and difficult. To prevent them from effecting their plan is a matter of the highest Importance, and will require a large &amp; respectable army and the most vigilant &amp;judicious exertions. </P>

<P>Since I wrote by Mr Hooper some small parcells of powder have arrived from Connecticut, which will give us a little assistance. </P>

<P>On Thursday night, a party of our men at Roxbury, made the Enemies Out Sentries consisting of a Corporal and two privates, prisoners without fir- ing a Gun or giving the least Alarm. </P>

<P>I shall be as attentive to the Enemies motions as I can, and Obtain all the Intelligence in my power, and If I find 'em embark, shall in the most expeditious manner detach a part of the light Troops to New York and re- pair thither myself If circumstances shall require It -I shall be better able to judge what to do when the matter happens, at present I can only say, that I will do every thing that shall appear proper and necessary. </P>

<P>Your Letter of the 12 Instt by Colonel [John] Bull came to hand yester- day evening, and shall agreable to your recommendation pay proper notice to him -the supply of Cash came very seasonably, as our Treasury was just exhausted and nothing can be done here ~vithout It.

<P>Sir Chatham Boston 26th February 1776. I acquainted you in my last that on the 27th of January, a few days pre- vious to the departure of Admiral Graves, who Sailed the 2d instant, I took upon me the Command of His Majesty's Squadron in North America, and finding upon enquiry a great Scarcity of Naval, as well as Ordnance Stores at this place, belonging to the King, and few or none of either to be purchased but at the most extravagant Prices, I thought it the first part of my Duty to dispatch a Transport under Convoy of an Armed Vessel to Halifax, to bring a Supply of both kinds of those Stores, on which Service they Sailed from hence the 11 th Instant. On the 13th instant an Advice Boat belonging to General [William] Howe Arrived here from that Port, and brought me a Letter from Captain [Charles] Hudson of His Majesty's Ship Orpheus with the satisfactory Ac- count of his Arrival there, tho' in a very shattered Condition, together with one from Capt [Hugh] Bromedge of the Savage Sloop (Copies of both which accompany this) and the latter informing me of the Seizure of Two Vessels laden with Naval Stores, which tho' perhaps legally cleared out in England, were certainly designed to Supply the Rebellious Inhabitants of the Ameri- can Colonies, as the Owners and Claimants of both of them are reported here to be notorious and principal inflamers of the present unhappy Rebel- lion, as a confirmation of which I transmit to you, Sir, herewith a Copy of a Letter to me from General Howe on that Subject, and shall be glad to re- ceive through You His Majesty's or their Lordships pleasure, with regard to these two Vessels, as well as to Thirty Six More, Seized and detained by Vice Admiral Graves's Orders and now lying in this Harbour under similar Cir- cumstances, Application having been made to me lately, by the Agents, for my direction relating to them, Copy of whose Letter I send you herewith. In a former Letter I took the liberty of recommending to their Lord- ships through You, that all Supplies to this Country might be sent in Armed Vessels, I mean such as our old Forty Gun Ships with only their upper Tier of Guns, for however Numerous our Cruizers may be, or however attentive our Officers to their Duty, it has been found impossible to prevent some of our Ordnance and other valuable Stores in small Vessels falling into the hands of the Rebels; and here I must take occasion to say that in the Course </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>of my Service I never found Officers perform their Duty with so much per- severance and Vigilance as Ours, on this important Service, indeed, the firm- ness with which they have resisted the riguor of this long and Severe Winter, in constantly keeping the Sea on their respective Stations, is unprecedented and incredible; at the same time I must beg leave to observe to you the very few Ships I am provided with to enable Me to Co-operate with the Army, Cruize off the Ports of the Rebels to prevent their receiving Supplies, or pro- tect those destined to this place from falling into their hands, and as it must be the first and principal object of my Consideration I have not been able yet to comply with their Lordship's Order of the 10th October for sending a Vessel to Bermuda for the safety and defence of the Ordnance Stores belong- ing to His Majesty at that Island, but intend sending the Nautilus Sloop on that Service immediately on her Arrival from her Cruize.

[George] Vandeput in the ship Asia, who demanded of him what his cargo consisted of. That Capt. Vandeput ordered the hatches of the sloop to be opened, and took out 42 tierces of bread, 5 firkins of butter and 30 barrels of flour, for the payment whereof, he gave this examinant an order on Abm. Lott, Esqr. and then put 14 or 15 men on board the sloop and brought her along side of the ship Dutches of Gordon; that he was there ordered by Govr. Tryon to get his tackles ready; that Govr. Tryon directed all the flour to be taken out of the sloop and put on board of the Dutches; that 149 barrels were taken out of the sloop by Govr. Tryon's order and put on board of the Dutches; that 2 barrels of the finest flour was set by for the ship's use, and the rest stowed in the hold; that Govr. Tryon asked for his account; that he, this examinant asked 19s. per hundred for his flour, as he had been informed that was the market price; that Govr.

Vandeput's barge stopped the vessel of Thompson from Brunswick; that they detained him some time and then sent him back again; that Capt. Vandeput told him, seemingly in a low voice and when he was alone, that he might inform his countrymen that if they sent up provisions fit for shipping he would stop it, but he would not stop loose or unpacked provisions, such as butter, eggs, or pork in quarters for the use of the city, but that he could not let any thing pass which was in barrels; that he, the examinant saw a considerable quantity of beef and mutton in quarters, and pieces hanging between decks in the ship Asia. </P>

<P>Sir Philadelphia, Feby 26th, 1776. The Enclosed order of Congress of the 23d inst I am Directed to trans- mit to our Colony, and I make no doubt (if they have not already) they will speedily comply with the Recommendations. The necessity of arms &amp; ammunition for our Defence and the Danger of a Disappointment, shows the necessity of using our utmost efforts to be sup- plied as much as may be within ourselves. And tho' I can with pleasure in- form you that large Quantities of Powder and salt petre have arrived here, and more is Dayly expected, yet as we have reason to believe that as soon as the spring opens, our harbors will be much infested with the British cruis- ers, who have orders to seize all American vessels, and as large Quantities of military stores will be wanted for sea, as well as land service, I humbly con- ceive it will be prudent to endeavour to supply ourselves with the necessar- ies of life &amp; Defense within ourselves and leave as little to the uncertainty of winds, weather &amp; Enemies as possible, at least for the present. You will please, sir, to see that the several orders of our Convention or assembly for manufacturing arms, gunpowder &amp; saltpetre be transmitted to me, and an account of what has been done in consequence of such orders, as it is necessary the Congress should know as soon as may be, the true state of all the Colonies with regard to. their supplying themselves with these neces- sary articles; And when our Assembly meets, you will please to lay these re- solves before them, and, in the mean time, communicate them to the Coun- cil, or Committee of Safety, or avhoever they have left to transact Business in their Recess. I am [&amp;c.] Josiah Bartlett. </P>

<P>Having received intelligence that there are two Arm'd Vessels belong- ing to the Rebels which lately escorted some others Laden with Flour down the Chesepeak bay, and are now supposed to be laying 'off Baltim~re.~ </P>

<P>You are therefore hereby required and directed to use all possible dispatch in getting his Majesty's Ship under your command ready for the Sea, to take with you the Liverpools Tender, which is now Cruizing about the Capes, and'proceed imediately up the Bay to Baltimore in search of the abovemen- tioned Pirates, to pursue them wherever you may get intelligence of them, and to use every means in your power to take or destroy them. </P>

<P>When you arrive off Baltimore and should not be fortunate enough to meet with the Rebel Privateers, you are to endeavour to cut out of the har- bour any vessels you may suspect to be Laden with any kind of Provisions or that have the appearance of being proper for Arming; and in case you should be obstructed in so doing, by the Town of Baltimore, you are imedi- ately to fire upon the Town, and do your utmost to destroy it. And whereas it is expected that the Rebels have erected a Battery on a point which commands the Mouth of the River leading to Baltimore; should that prove to be so, and appear to be such that, it cannot possibly be destroyed with your force, you will in that case content your self with taking an exact Survey of it, rather than expose his Majesty's Arms to an insult: </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 	93 </P>

<P>And whereas his Majesty's Ships on this station are in great want of Pro- visions, particularly fresh Meat; When the above service shall have been ef- fected, you will consult with Mr Goodridge [Bridger Goodrich] (who is to accompany you with an Armed Sloop) and use your best endeavours to pro- cure a quantity of live Stock; And wherever you find the inhabitants disposed to Supply you, you are to pay them ready money for every thing you take from them; But if they refuse to do so you are to take it by force of Arms. </P>

<P>You are to annoy the Rebels by every means in your power, and to Seize and detain all American Vessels you may meet with, as well as those of any other Country that may be Trading with the Americans, and send them to me for examination. </P>

<P>Upon your return you are to call at Annapolis, and deliver the enclosed Packet to Governor [Robert] Eden -</P>

<P>Sir-As you intimated that you could conveniently assist the smaller armed vessels with forty good men from on board the ship Prosper; and as we judge it to be very necessary for the public service immediately to equip these vessels for cruizing on the coast, we desire you will order thirty such men on board the brigantine Comet, to obey the orders of Capt. [Joseph] Turpin and his officers; and ten men on board the scooner Defence, to obey the orders of Capt [Simon] Tufts and his officers. </P>

<P>Since writing the above I have considered that as Hudsons River is not yet open, the Delay of laying the Matter about the pork before Congress for their Determination cannot be attended with any evil consequences and they may probably adopt a better Mode, if not they can give Orders to some person in Jersey to purchase the pork, and send it as above -Mr Peter Zabriskie of Hackinsack a real Friend to our Cause might be employed to see it transported to Hudsons River. </P>

<P>[Extract] , Phila 27 Feby 1776. . . . I called on Mr [Robert] Morris to know &quot;the quantity'of Arms &amp; powder imported by him for the province, he was from home, his Clerk in- form[ed] me about 400 stand of- arms &amp; 3500 lbs of Cannon powder, I have directed a Gent of Maryland now in this city to receive them &amp; to forward them by the stages to Elk from thence to'send them in a Boat to Back River </P>

<P>in Balt. City, with orders for the skipper of the boat to proceed to Balt Town &amp; there take directions, in what manner to land them. I have taken this precaution to avoid all danger for should any Tender or armed vessel be cruising in Patapsco River, the boat can proceed to the head of Back River &amp; land the arms &amp; powder within five mile; of the town -if no vessel of the Enemy, she can run round without any great expence incurred by the delay -last night a ship arrived here from Bristol which' she left the 17th of Decr she cleared out for Cork to avoid suspission, notwithstanding which, she was strictly searched &amp; a letter being discovered, directed to a Mercht in Philadelphia, the'ship was detained but the letter being merely on private business the Capt on his petition, was discharged &amp; permitted to sail some News-papers &amp; private letters are brought in they were stowed away by a messenger in the: bottom of a Barrel of bread, which being placed in a care- less manner, as if for the ships use, it escaped the search, one of the letters was directed to Willing '&amp; 'M~rris,~ a</P>

Britain, &amp; the only alternative, absolute slavery or Independency, the latter 1 have oftens;eprobated both ,in public &amp; private, but am now almost convinced the measure is right &amp; can be justified by necessity -the Gent who inclosed the Bill to W &amp; M, writes that 26000'troops are to be employed in America that a sufft body of men are to defend Boston, while difft bodies are to attack New York, Virginia &amp; South Carolina, that Lord [Charles] Cornwallis is destined for the last place with 5000 men &amp; was to sail in January. . . . </P>

<P>Colonel [Richard] Corbin is returned from his fruitless journey to Lord Dunmore, who refused to give a commission for holding an Assembly, and only proposed that the principal gentlemen in the country should sign prop- ositions for an accomodation, with which he would go home; but we pre- sume he must get them signed by his old friends in the fleet, or about Nor- folk, as he will get very few Gentlemens names to it. He said Commissioners were to negotiate, but did not say who they were. </P>

<P>His Lordship is not recalled, but has leave to go if he chuses it. His conduct is appr&amp;ed of, and he has unlimited powers to draw on the treasury. Col. Corbin says that he, General Clinton, and Capt. Haminond, all appeared in good humour, the latter declaring he had forbid his tenders to offer injury to individuals or their property, his sole design being to watch the water, and enforce the acts of trade. General Clinton had four companies who had not landed, but, on the contrary, the transports with the Mercury had fallen down into the road (Hampton) under sailing orders; he did not mention his destination, but it was gathered from the young officers, that they were to pay a visit to Governor Martin, at Cape Fear, and then proceed to South Carolina. On hearing that part of our letter to Col. Cor- bin read, &quot;that we were not authorized or inclined to intermeddle in the mode of negotiation, which must be left to Congress,&quot; the General said there was nothing America could ask in a constitutional way but would be granted, but if we relied on the Congress, we had nothing to expect from Parliament. Lord Dunmore wanted to borrow his troops to drive ours erom Kemp's; he asked if ours would not return? the other said he supposed they would; then, says the General, I don't think it worth while to meddle- with them. </P>

<P>P.S. We have just received intelligence from Hampton, that Gen. Clin- ton, with his troops, the Mercury, Kingfisher, and two or three tenders, went out of the capes yesterday. . </P>

<P>[February 17' to February 27,17761 </P>

<P>. . . on the 17th [February] we took the advantage of a favorable Breeze to pay a Visit to the Earl of Dunmore in Virginia, where we found his Lord- ship on board a Ship in Hampton Road, driven from the Shore and the whole Country in arms against him. On which Account I must confess I could not see the Use of his Lordship's remaining longer there, especially after the failure of his Attack on the Rebel Post at the Great Bridge. I how- </P>

<P>ever let his Lordship retain the Detachment of the 14th Regiment than at- tending him, as he seemed to flatter himself that some opportunity might yet offer for his acting to advantage. Unfortunately the day after our Arrival a Gale of Wind had considerably daniaged our Transport by driving her foul of the Mercury; which made it necessary to get her repaired before we could move. This accident &amp; contrary Winds detained us within the Capes until the 27th, when we at last took our departure for Cape Fear. </P>

<P>N[ol 3 Wilmington 27th Feby 1776 Sir The Inhabitants of Wilmington by their representatives in committee in answer to your Excellencies demand of One Thousand Barrels of flour </P>

<P>for his Majesties Service: beg leave to assure your Excellency: that they have been always most cordially disposed to promote his Majesties real Service, which they think consistent only with the good of the whole british empire -But the Inhabita[nts] are aston-hed at the quantum of your Excellencies requisition, as they cannot conceive what service his Majesty [has] in this part of the world for so much flour. -In the most quiet &amp; peaceable Times, when the Ports were open &amp; Trade flourished, it would have been impos- sible to procure such a Quantity in this Town in so short a time as your Excellency mentions -How then can your Excellency expect a Compliance from the Inhabitants of Wilmington during the present Stagnation of Com- merce? At a Time too, when you well know that an army raised and com- missioned by your Excellency hath been for some Time possessed of Cross Creek and the adjac[e]nt Country from whence only we can expect the Ar- ticle you have thought proper to Demand </P>

<P>We can with Truth assure your Excellency that it is not in our power to comply with your requisition either in whole or in part, many of the In- habitants having for sometime past wanted flour for private Use, and the dread of Military Execution by the Ships of War hath induced most of the Inhabitants to remove their effects. The Inhabitants Sir sincerely wish they had not reason to suspect that your Excellencys Demand is only a prelude to the intended destruction of the devoted Town of Wilmington. If this should be the Case, it will not however make any alteration in their determination. It will be their duty to defend their property to the utmost and if they do not Succeed altogether to their wish, they have one Consola- tion left, that their freinds will in a few days have it in their power to make ample retribution upon those whom your Excellency thinks proper to digni- fy with the epithets of freinds to Government. These faithless &amp; selfish people are now surrounded by three armies above four times their Number and the Town of Cross Creek now in our hands will make some, though a very inadequate, compensation for the destruction of Wilmington </P>

<P>This Sir is no boast &amp; we would not treat your Excellency with so much disrespect as to make use of Threats -The Accot we have given you is sa- credly true and we have the most convincing proofs of it in our possession I have the honour to be by order of the committee Sir Your Excellencys </P>

<P>Sir The reasons why his Majesties ships have not been supplied with the usual Quantity of Provisions, is so obvious, that it cannot possibly have es- caped the sagacity of Captain Parry The Trade of this Colony hath been distressed by the Kings Ships even contrary to the acts of the British Parlia- ment The Military Stores, the property of the People have been seized with an avowed Intention to subjugate them to slavery -The fort which the Peo- ple had built at a great Expence for the protection of their Trade made use of for a purpose the very reverse, and when they attempted to demolish it they have been fired upon by the ships of war. The Slaves of the American Inhabitants, have been pursued, and many of them seizd and inveigled from their duty, and their live Stock &amp; other property killed &amp; plundered, long be- fore the Committee thought it-necessary to deny the Ships a supply of Provisions, and to Crown all, you Sir for the Second Time, have brought up the Cruizer and several Armed Vessels,. to cover the landing of an Army Composed of highland banditti; most of whom are as destitute of Property, as they are of Principle, &amp; none of whom you will ever see, unless as fugitives imploring protection. Tho you' should come up before the Town, you can- not expect any other answer than what we now give you. We have not the least intention of opposing either your Ships or Boats, unless you should at- </P>

<P>tempt to injure us. and whenever you may think proper to treat the Inhab- itants as his Majesties officers did heretofore, we shall be happy to receive you. in the manner which we always wish to. receive those who, have the honour to bear his'Majesties Commission I am by Order- of the Committee Sir [&amp;c.] </P>

We have found the Transport so necessary for our Wounded, Men, that I could-not conveniently send her, they are near recovered, and I flatter myself I shall soon send her loaded. I beg leave to observe, by the Weekly Return we run short of some Articles of Provisions, not to be got here, Indeed Fresh Beef and Greens &amp;ca .Market stuff is all we do get. Ir, some former Letters I mentioned to Admiral Graves the situation of the Towns about here, and my reasons for not destroying them, it would be a great satisfaction to know your sentiments upon that head, it has been my Opinion some time, that a small additional Land Force tack'd to the Squad- ron would secure this Post, and oblige them to keep a greater Number of Men to guard the Coast along the Sound, harrass, and do them great Injury and oblige them to give up all the Islands to Us. -[Charles] Lee has been sometime at [New] York -Hopkins is Sailed with the Philadelphia Fleet. -The Continental Congress has Voted themselves perpetual, so says report, our Intelligence is not much to be depended upon they keep so strict a look out.-Inclosed is the State and Condition of His Majesty's Ships.-I have the honor to-be [&amp;c.] </P>

<P>No1 5 [Cruizer Sloop of War off Wilmington, February 28, 17761 I have been much surprised to receive an answer to my requisition di- rected to the Magistrates &amp; Inhabitants of Wilmington from a Member of the lawful1 Magistracy in the Name &amp; under the Traiterous Guize of a Com- bination unknown to the laws &amp; Constitution of this Country- as if the Magistrates and Inhabitants of Wilmington chose rather to appear in the Garb of Rebellion than in the Character of his Majesties loyal &amp; faithful1 Subjects The quantity of flour that I required for his Majesties Service I con-cluded from the information I had received, that the Town of Wilmington might have well supplied within the Time I appointed by my Note and I </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 1776 </P>

<P>should have been contented with the quantity that was obtainable: The requisition was not made as the answer to it imports for a prelude to the destruction of that Town which has not been in contemplation, but was in- tended as a Test of the disposition of its Inhabitants whose sence I am un- willing to believe is known to the little arbitrary Junto (stiling itself a Com- mittee) which has presumed to answer for the People in this and other Instances </P>

<P>The revilings of Rebellion &amp; the Gasconadings of Rebels are below the Contempt of the loyal &amp; faithful1 People whom I have most justly stiled Freinds of Government and the forbearance of menaces I have little reason to consider as a mark of Respect from the Chairman of a Combination founded in Usurpation &amp; Rebellion </P>

No Sooner was that disturbance quelled than another of the Same nature &amp; tendency was heard in North Carolina, a body of Men to the amount of 2310 took Arms in the back Counties in order to force their way down to Wilmington where they were to be received by Governor Martin -the Governor by our last Account had advanced with his little Fleet near to that Town &amp; would to be before it in two days more, but his expected friends from the Western frontier have been beaten &amp; dispersed by Cololiel [James] Moore, therefore his Excellency by ret[r]ograde Steps must regain his old Station on the Sea Side, where he may possibly be met by the American Fleet under Commodore Hopkins -The American Fleet is a new power &amp; may be despised by those&quot; who;affect to con[d]emn every thing but their own, be that as it may, it is the beginning of what may one day prove very formidable to the Enemies of America -We expect that Fleet here, if the King's Ships do not destroy it in the passage. Should it arrive Safe, it will probably be augmented by all those King's Ships which now ride in the River Savanna -nothing but dire necessity can make us wish for its Success -</P>

Should you be so,unfortunate as to meet with any of the rebel cruiz- ers and find no possibility of escaping, it is my positive .dire&lt;tions that you do throw overboard all arms and ammunition, to prevqnt their falling into the hands of the rebels. Should there be any ship in sight that you suppose to be a man of war, you are to do your utmost to disable the ship by cutting her gears and lowering her lower yards down, in order to prevent the rebels from carrying her off. . Upon your arrival at Boston you are to report );ourself *to Admiral Shuldham, or the Commander-in-Chief for the time being. </P>

<P>[Extract] . . Wilmington. 29th Feb. 1776 .. Gentlemen Since I had the honor to write to you last Saturday, the Cruizer Sloop of War with three other armed Vessels arrived in view of this Town on mon- 'day Evening. The next morning Governor.Martin made a demand'of One thousand pounds of Flour. And Captain [Francis] Parry informed the In- habiiants that'he shoud'come up in the Evening to know the reason why the Kings Ships had not been supply'd with Provisions as usual. The Committee gave.answers to both those messages. The Governor replyd and was again answered, and Captain Parry sent a Note Yesterday for some fresh Beef I have transmitted you Copies of the papers which past on this occasion and-I hope what have been wrote by the Committee will meet with your approbation. It is worthy your notice the different Styles in which Mr Par- ry writes first and last the first is an imperious demand, the last a civil </P>

<P>reque~t.~These Vessels are lying here with intention to cover the landing of their highland Friends, whom they expect to* come -down in triumph. How sensible must be their disappointment when they hear that all their hopes are frustrated. The inclosed is a Copy of a Letter recd from Col. [James] Moore and contains one of the fullest Account of the Battle we have yet received One of our Expresses that returned to day from the Camp informs us that the highlanders broke down their Waggons, and many of them rode away three upon an horse We impatiently waite for all the particulars of this Action which tho' it may appear trifling, will I doubt not be attended with the most important consequences, for as two of the Tory leaders and particularly the second in command fell in the Action I think it very improbable that the principa[l] Officers will be able, were they ever so willing to unite the Army again. Indeed we are assured that the few Regu- lators they had among them have left them and that they discharged what Prisoners they had. and I have no doubt but many ol the poor highlanders will be pleased tb get home, beiilg, as they confest, forced and perswaded, contrary to their inclinations into:the Service </P>

<P>I have inclosed you, Gentlemen, a return of the men under my Command. You will perceive -we are far from being powerful-and Col. [Robert] Salters men arrived only yesterday .Evening the men I have being very insufficient considering the Post I have to maintain, and the almost numberless preparations for defence, which I have got to make. I shall to morrow have a.Battery prepared, and a nine pounder mounted, &amp; as soon as it can be affected, I shall mount a few Six pounders. After this I shall have it in my power to compleat the fire Rafts, from which I was obliged to desist on the arrival df the armed Vessels. </P>

<P>Col. [John] Ashe and his party has been here since Saturday, without having done any Duty. He had told Col. Rhodes, that he woud let me have 58 men or more to assist in compleating the Battery. I had sent a [c'ilvil message for that purposy, but before it cou'd be delivered Mr Wm.Robeson came, and [said] it wou'dcbe necessary to have it in writing. I accordingly sent a written message which is inclosed and which I thought coud not give offence even to the self important Col Ashe. He thought proper however to return it with a verbal answer, that he did not obey any orders. . . L </P>

<P>Col. Ashe advised me on the appearance of the Cruize,r and other armed Vessels to abandon the Town and join Col. Moore. The few men I had woud have been of little service to the main body and I had not the least Idea of deserting a Post of so much importance, and.which I knew ,the En- emy intended to occupy. On the 27th inst his people applyd for six rounds of Carteridges declaring their intention of joining the main body. they had that additional supply of Ammunition, yet they are still in Town.. I have told the Commissary that they are no longer to eat at the p~bii~k </P>

[~homas] Savage, having found the Congress of that colony dissolved, they made every representation to the Council of Safety, to induce them to co-operate with this colony, in continuing the non-exportation resolution of the Continental Congress: That the council represented to them the great opposition, in Savannah, to the measures of Congress, which had not entered into any decisive resolve on that head; but that they would do every thing in their power to co-operate with us: And in short, that it was their opinion, unless this colony interfered in a forcible manner, exportation would speedi- ly take place. </P>

<P>On the 1st of arch [1776] the squadron anchored at Abaco, one of the Bahama Islands, and carried in there two sloops belonging to New Providence. Some persons on board the sloops, informed that a quantity of powder and warlike &lt;stores might be taken in the forts of New Providence. An expedition was determined on against that island. It was resolved to embark the marines on board the two sloops. They were to re- main below deck until the sloops had anchored in the harbour close to the forts, and they were then to land and take possession. There was not a single soldier in the island to opose'them; therefore the plan would have succeeded, and not only the public stores might have been secured, but a considera- ble contribution might have been obtained as a ransom for the town and island, had not the whole squadron appeared off the harbour in the morn- ing, instead of remaining out of sight till after the sloops had entered and the marines secured the forts. On the appearance of the squadron the sig- nal of alarm was fired, so that it was impossible to think of crossing the bar. The commander in chief proposed to go round the west end of the is- land, and endeavour to march the marines up and get behind the town; but this could never have been effected. The islanders would have had time to collect; there was no fit anchorage for the squadron, nor road from that part of the island to the town. Mr. Jones finding by the Providence pilots that the squadron might anchor under a key three leagues to windward of the harbour, gave this account to the commander in chief, who objecting to the dependence on the pilots, Mr. Jones undertook to carry the Alfred safe in. He took the pilot with him to the fore-topmast-head, from whence they could clearly see every danger, and the squadron anchored safe. The ma- rines, with two vessels to cover their landing, were immediately sent in by the east passage. The commander in chief promised to touch no private property. The inhabitants abandoned the forts, and the governor, finding he must surrender the island, embarked all the powder in two vessels, and sent them away in the night. This was foreseen, and might have been </P>

<P>&quot;EXTRACTOF A LETTER FROM NEWYORK,MARCH2.&quot; </P>

<P>An affair has lately been discovered here which has given no small un- easiness to the Congress. Some manoeuvres of Governor Tryon convinced that Assembly that he was perfectly acquainted with their proceedings, and they were at a loss to guess from what quarter he could get his intelligence. At length, a doubt arose in the breast of Mr [James] Duane, </P>

<P>(a principal Member of the Congress,) that his Valet,Who had formerly lived with Governor Tryon, had at night, when he went to bed, taken his Minutes out of his pocket, which he had copied, and sent to his late Master. He informed the Congress of his suspicion, and it was agreed that he should put, as usual, some Minutes in his pocket, but they should be fictitious ones, in order, if possible, to ascertain his Servant's dishonesty before he was apprehended: This was accordingly done; the Servant, as it is supposed, copied and sent them to the Governor, who soon'found that the Servant ei-ther had imposed on him, or was himself imposed on, and therefore gave him notice to take care of himself; he fled immediately, and is said to be sent to England in the last ship that sailed from hence. </P>

<P>Dear Sir-March 2nd, </P>

<P>Phoenix, ~e&amp;-~ork, 1776. This will be delivered to you by Mr [John] Young, a young gentleman of fortune, from Philadelphia, as I am informed. His errand to Boston is to offer himself a volunteer to General Howe. During six weeks' residence on board the Phoenix, his behavior was such as to entitle him to every civility I could shew him, and from his request take the li'berty of presenting him to you. The sloop Francis is loaded with naval stores, tobacco, &amp;c. In the arti- cle of tobacco, she has a great deal more than is cleared out from the custom house. I therefore presume that becomes forfeited to th'e captors, by the acts of trade. Should this be the case, I beg you will be pleased to allow your secretary to sell it as our agent. There is also a strong suspicion that the ship loaded with salt has wines and other merchandise under the salti2 The owners of both these vessels are good subjects to the King, and I have assured them they will be treated with as much lenity as the times will admit of. Since I had the honour of writing to you on the 25th of last month, I find General Lee is ordered to Canada to take command of the army in that country, and a General Schuyler to have the command at this place. Lee has pulled down the north curtain of the fort, and is now entrenching what was called the Bowling Green. The privateer, it is said, has certainly sailed from Philadelphia. I am, Sir, with great esteem [kc.] H.Parker. </P>

<P>[New Brunswick] Saturday, March 2, 1776. The Congress proceeded to the determination of the prize ship Blue Mountain Valley, now lying at ~lizabetfitown Point, lately seized by Lord Stirling, with detachments of the Continental forces, and militia: And it appearing by the testimony of credible witnesses, upon their oaths, that the </P>

<P>said ship, John H.Dempster, master, sailed from London some time last fall, laden with stores shipped by order of the right honorable the Lords Com- missioners of his Majesty's Treasury, bound to the port of Boston, or any one other port in America: The said cargo by the bill of loading, dated the 30th day of September, 1775, to be delivered unto the Commander-in-Chief of his Majesty's forces in America, or to his order. And the honorable Con- tinental Congress, having previous to the taking the aforesaid ship, </P>

<P>Resolved, That all transport vessels in the same service, having </P>

<P>on board any troops, arms, ammunition, clothing, provisions, or </P>

<P>military or naval stores of what kind so ever, and all vessels to </P>

<P>MARCH .1776- . 141 . </P>

<P>whomesoever belonging, that shall be employed in carrying provi- . </P>

<P>sions or other necessaries, to the British army or armies, or navy, </P>

<P>that now are, or hereafter shall be within any of the United Colo- </P>

<P>nies, or any goods, wares, or merchandize, for the use of such fleet </P>

<P>or army, shall be liable'to seizure, and, with their cargoes, shall be </P>

<P>confiscated. </P>

<P>It is therefore Resolved, That the said ship Blue Mountain Valley, with such of her cargo, as was shipped by order of the said Lords Commis- sioners of his Majesty's Treasury directed, as by said bills of loading, to be delivered at the port of Boston, or elsewhere, unto the Commander-in-Chief of his Majesty's forces in America, or to his order: shall be and is hereby confiscated to the use of the captors, pursuant to the general directions for distribution, resolved on by the said honorable Continental Congress. </P>

<P>Resolved, That the said ship and cargo be disposed of by any two agents or persons to be chosen, the one by Lord Stirling, and the other by the Com- mittee of Elizabethtown. </P>

<P>Resolved, That all the necessary charge and expense, which have arisen, by guarding and securing said prize, and supporting the seamen, be first de- ducted out of the neat proceeds of such sales. </P>

<P>Resolved, That the amount of the sales of the ship and cargo (the ex- pense and charge of guarding and securing the same, and supporting the sea- men being first deducted and paid thereout) be divided among all the cap- tors, as well those of the militia sent out by the Committee of Elizabethtown, as such of the Continental forces as were employed in that service under Lord Stirling: that the said distribution be made among the officers, pri- vates, and to the vessels employed in the said captor, in such manner as is usually distributed in the neighbouring Colonies, agreeable to resolutions of the Continental Congress. </P>

<P>Resolved, That all such goods, wares, and merchandize on board said ship, belonging to the captain, mates, and seamen, as their, or either of their own private properties, be reserved for the proprietors thereof, and deliv- ered to them free of all costs and deductions. </P>

<P>Resolved, That the captain and seamen belonging to said ship when seized, be suffered to go to any place they may think proper (his Majesty's fleet or army only excepted.) </P>

<P>And this Congress recommend to the captors of said ship, to make some gratuity to each of the seamen on board, to enable them to travel to some other parts in pursuit of business. </P>

<P>proper to be delivered to Col. Bull, made a report; which being amended, was unanimously agreed to as follows: </P>

<P>South-Carolina. By Authority of Congress. To Stephen Bull, Esq; Colonel, or, To the Commanding Officer for the time being, of the South- Carolina forces ordered to act in aid of Georgia. Whereas there is reason to apprehend, that attempts will be made to cause the merchant vessels in Savannah River to sail with their cargoes: And as such a proceeding would be ,detrimental to the interest of America; it becomes this colony to aid the friends of America in Georgia, by endeavouring, with them, effectually to prevent the said vessels sailing with their cargoes: Therefore, you are hereby ordered under the.direction of the Colonel of the conti- nental forces in Georgia, and with the concurrence of the friends of America in that colony, to take post on either side of Savannah River, with the troops under your command, and use every effort in your power to incapacitate those vessels from proceeding with their cargoes on their several voyages; and to that end, cause them to be forthwith unrigged, their rudders taken off, and their sails and rud- ders deposited in some secure place, or kept under a proper guard. You are also ordered, under the direction and with the concur- rence aforesiad, to give every aid in your power for repelling insur- rections and invasions there, and securing and imprisoning every person in ~eorgia, whose going at large may be dangerous to the liberties of America, or the'security of that colony. Having executed these orders, you are, erther with all or a part of'the forces under your command, to return to this colony, or re- main in Georgia, at your discretion, and so act, under the direc- tion, and with the concurrence aforesaid, as you shall think most advantageous to the American cause, until you shall receive further instructions from the Congress or Council of Safety of this colony; to whom you are, from time to time, to transmit full information of your proceedings. Ordered, That an engrossed copy of the above orders be forthwith made out, signed by Mr. President, and delivered to Col. Bull. All Which was done accordingly. Ordered, That the sum of two thousand pounds be advanced to Col. Bull, for the above service, to be accounted for by him. </P>

<P>Resolved, That the delegates for this Province shall be instructed to ap- ply to the Continental Congress for an indemnification to such persons who shall suffer in the defence of this town or shipping. </P>

<P>Resolved, That it shall be considered as a defection from the cause of America, and a desertion of property in such persons who have and shall leave the town of Savannah, or the hamlets thereunto belonging, during the present alarm, and such persons shall be precluded from any support or countenance towards obtaining an indemnification. , </P>

<P>Resolved, That it be incumbent upon the friends of America in this Province to defend the metropolis as long as the same shall be tenable. </P>

<P>Resolved, That rather than the same shall be held and occupied by our enemies, or the shipping now in the port of Savannah taken and employed by them, that the same shall be burnt and destroyed. </P>

<P>On your arrival in France you will, for some time, be engaged in the business of providing goods for theUIndian trade. ,This will give good countenance to your appearing in the character of a merchant, which we wish you continually to retain among the French in general, it being prob- able that the court of France may not like it should be known publicly, that any agent f;om the Colonies is in, that country. When you come to Paris, by delivering Dr. Franklin's letter to Monsieur [Jean Baptiste] Le Roy, at the Louvre, and M. [Barbeu] Dubourg, you will be introduced to a set of ac- quaintance,all friends to the Americans. By conve;sing with them you will have a good opportunity of acquiring Parisian French, and you will find in M.Dubourg a man prudent, faithful, secret, intelligent in affairs, and capa- ble of giving you very sage advice. </P>

<P>It is scarcely necessary to pretend any other business at Paris than the gratifying of that curiosity, which draws numbers thither year1y;merely 'to see so famous a city. With the assistance of Monsieur Dubourg, who under- stands English, you will be able to make immediate application to Monsieur [Charles Gravier] de Vergennes, ministre des aflaires etrangtres, either personally or by letter, if M.Dubourg adopts that method, acquainting him that you are in France upon business of the American Congress, in'the char- acter of a merchant, having something to communicate to him that may be mutually Geneficial to France and the North American Colonies; that you request an audience of him, .and that he would be pleased to appoint the time and place. At this audience, if agreed to, it may be well to show him first your letter of .credence, and ,then-acquaint him that the Congress, find- ing-that in the common course of commerce, it-was not practicable to fur- nish-the-continent of iAmerica with the quantity of arms and. ammunition &quot;' MARCH 1776 </P>

That France had been pitched on for the first application, from an opinion that if we should, as there is a great appearance we shall, come to a total separation from Great Britain, France would be looked upon as the power whose friendship it would be fittest for us to obtain and cultivate. That the commercial advan- tages Britain had enjoyed with the Colonies had contributed greatly to her late wealth and importance. That it is likely great part of our commerce will naturally fall to the share of France, especially if she favors us in this ap- plication, as that will be a means of gaining and securing the friendship of the Colonies; and that as our trade was rapidly increasing with our increase of people, and, ili a greater proportion, her part of it will be extremely valuable. That the supply we at present .want is clothing and arms. for twenty-five thousand men, with a suitable quantity of ammunition, and one hundred field pieces. That we mean to pay for the same by remittances to France, or through Spain, Portugal, or the French Islands, as soon as our navigation can be protected by ourselves or friends; and that we, besides, want great quantities of linens and woolens, with other articles for the In- dian trade, which .you are now actually purchasing, and for which you ask no credit, and that the whole, if France should grant the other supplies, </P>

<P>-</P>

<P>would make a cargo which it might be 'well to secure by a convoy of two or three ships of war. </P>

<P>If you should find M.de Vergennes reserved, and not inclined to enter into free conversation with you, it may be well to shorten your visit, request him to consider what you have proposed, acquaint him with your place of lodging, that you may yet stay sometime at Paris, and that, knowing how precious his time is, you do not presume to ask another audience; but that, if he should have any commands for you, you will, upon the least notice, immediately wait upon him. If, at a future conference, he should be more free, and you find a disposition to favor the Colonies, it may be proper to ac- quaint him that they must necessarily be anxious to know the disposition of France on certain points, which, with his permission, you would mention, such as whether, if the Colonies should be forced to form themselves into an independent State, France would probably acknowledge them as such, re- ceive their embassadors, enter into any treaty or alliance with them, for commerce or defense, or both? If so, on what principal condition3 Inti-mating that you shall speedily have an opportunity of sending to America, if you do not immediately return, and that he may be assured of your fidelity and secrecy in transmitting carefully anything he would wish toconvey to the Congress on that subject. In subsequent conversations you may as you find it convenient, enlarge on these topics that have~been the subjects of our con- ferences with you, to which you may occasionally add the well-known sub- stantial answers we usually give to the several calumnies thrown out against 'us. If these supplies on the credit of the Congress should be refused, you are to endeavor the obtaining a permission of purchasing those articles, or </P>

You will keep a daily journal of all your material transacticns, and particularly of what passes in your conversation with great personages; and you will, by every safe opportunity, furnish us with such information as may be important. When your business in France admits of it, it may be well to go into Holland, and visit our agent there, M.

<P>You will endeavor to procure a meeting with Mr.[Edward] Bancroft by writing a letter to him, under cover to Mr.Griffiths, at Turnham Green, near London, and desiring him to come over to you in France or Holland, on the score of old acquaintance. From him you may obtain a good deal of information of what is now going forward in England, and settle a mode of continuing a correspondence. It may be well to remit him a small bill to -defray his expenses in coming to you, and avoid all political matters in your letter to him.

<P>Virginia the 3d March 1776. Sir By his Majestys Ship the Mercury yhich arrived here the 17th of last Month, I had the honor to receive your orders respecting the River Delawar, and you may depend, Sir, that I will do my utmost to execute them: I con-fess, however that, I am of opinion as the River is now become rather formi- dable, a much larger force is necessary for that service, than I am able to carry thither from hence. </P>

<P>I have here only the Liverpool, ill Man'd and sickly; the Otter in as bad a state; and the Kingsfisher Sloop: One Ship at least must be left at Norfolk to protect the Governor and the Fleet there, and not less than two can prop- erly guard the mouth of the Chesepeak-bay. In my judgment, Sir, not less than three or four Ships of good force with a small one to cruize off the Capes can promise much success in opening the passage up so narrow a Riv- er which the Rebels have employed their whole art and industry for this year past to block up. </P>

<P>I understand those Chevaux de Frizes which the Rebels have sunk, have at least forty or fifty Tons of Ballast in them, which I concieve will be very difficult to raise, especially as they are protected by Battery's on the Jersey shore and the Armed craft in the River: Therefore, Sir, if you should think proper to send me more Ships as I hope you will, I should be glad to have a few Howitzers or Cohorns, which will certainly be of great service. I must also take the liberty of saying that as Philadelphia is now an object of great consequence, I really think, if any Troops can be spared, a body of Men to land occasionally on each side of the River would be a great Assistance to the expedition. One cannot bear the Idea of His Majesty's Arms meeting with an insult; therefore am perhaps more cautious than necessary, but shall be perfectly satisfied with whatever force you think proper to send, and shall be most happy to receive any advice for my proceedings that you may please to give me </P>

<P>I have not yet been able to procure a Single Pilot for Philadelphia, but </P>

<P>have little doubt Captain [Alexander] Graeme of the Kingsfisher (who I </P>

<P>have employed on that service) will be able to succeed: I have sent with him </P>

<P>one of the Roebuck's officers in a Tender, with Orders in case of failing by </P>

<P>stratagem to decoy the Pilots off at Cape Henlopen, to send the Boats into </P>

<P>Lewis Town Creek, where they take Shelter, and endeavour to surprize </P>

<P>them in their Vessels. </P>

<P>I intend very soon to move the Roebuck round to the Delaware, and </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>shall leave Capt [Henry] Bellew here to receive your orders. </P>

<P>-I hope that I shall soon have the pleasure to hear from you, that you ap- prove of my request, and attribute the liberty I have taken to its true motive, the zeal I have for his Majesty's Service. I have the Honor to be Sir </P>

<P>di'stress:~ The Enterprize Transport with four Companies of the 55 Regi- ment on board, having lost all her Masts and otherwise greatly damaged I apprehend she cannot be repaired in any reasonable time to proceed for- ward with the Troops I therefore propose embarking them in the Royal George &amp; Diana Transports, and to Discharge the Enterprize 'from the Serv- ice &amp; send her back to England as soon as the Master gets her put into Condition to proceed there. </P>

<P>The four Companies of the 55 Regiment and three Companies of the 46:Regiment which came here in the Enterprize &amp; Argo Transports I have got accomodated in the Barracks at St Johns in this Island; whilst the Trans- port Ships are got ready to receive and proceed with them to Boston. </P>

<P>Since the Receipt of their Lordships Orders of the 2d September last, the Kings Ships under my Command, have Seized and Carried to the differ- ent Islands in these Seas; the American Vessels named in the List Inclosed, marked No 2: those that could be proceeded against by the Restraining Acts, or had transgressed any of the Acts of Trade; I directed to be prose- cuted immediately and the others to be detained 'till I might receive their Lordships farther Orders; which I hope will arrive soon, as most of the Cargoes in the American Vessels are of a Perishable Nature and if kept but a short time in this hott Climate will be wholly destroyed and lost. </P>

<P>I have likewise transmitted a paper marked No 3, Containing Intelli- gence given by some of the Masters &amp; people belonging to the Vessels that have been Seized here by the Kings Ships which I think it necessary their Lordships should be informed of. </P>

<P>Should the information of the Rebels Naval preparations be true, it is very probable some of thei; Cruizers may be sent into these Seas; where they undoubtedly might do a great deal of Mischief, in despight of the Small Squadron under by Command; now weakened by the Hind's going to St Augustine, with the three Companies of the 60 Regiment; and the Lynx coming to England. I therefore hope their Lordships will think proper to Order a Considerable Reinforcement of His Majesty's Ships to this Station; and thereby enable me to Protect and Secure the British Islands from Insult, and likewise prevent the Rebels carrying on a pernicious &amp; dangerous Traf- fick to the French, Dutch and Danish Islands; whose Inhabitants will readily give them such assistance as they may require, in return for the Provisions &amp; Lumber carried there by American Vessels; of which they now stand in great need. -</P>

<P>Indies where he arrived on the 6th day of July last; That he continued at Kingston from that Time till the 20th day of August following and in that Time sold the Cargo of said Briga, and laid out the neat proceeds in the purchase of the produce of sd Island and other Merchandize, &amp; laded the same on board sd Briga, cleared her out at the Custom House for New York, and on sd 20th day of August sailed from Kingston for New York -the De- ponent farther says that on his passage from Kingston to New York on the 20th day of Septemr Last being in Soundings &amp; not far from Land, about South West from Montauk, and South from Long Island, standing In for </P>

<P>MARCH 1776 </P>

<P>New York, we fell in with his Majesties Ship Nautilus, Commandd by Capt John Collins who immediately fired three Guns at us to bring us to, and hoisted out her pinnace and sent her with a Number of Armed Men on board the Briga, took said Briga into his possession, &amp; took this Deponent, and all his Mariners, the mate excepted out of sd Briga, &amp; put a prize Master &amp; Seamen on board in their stead and then stood away for Newport Rhode Island with said Briga in Company. </P>

<P>This Deponent also saith that he judged said Brigantine and her Ap- purtenances at the Time she was taken as aforesaid to be well worth Five Hundred pounds lawful1 Money, and that her Cargo consisted of the several Articles particularly enumerated &amp; sett down in the foregoing Account on this Sheet of paper,2 that the same were the property of the several persons therein mentioned, and that, to the best of his Knowlege and Belief, the same would have ben worth the prices thereto set and affixed amounting in the whole to twenty five Hundred thirty four pounds nineteen Shillings and two pence lawfull Money had he been permitted to carry-them into the port for which said Briga was destined. </P>

<P>This Deponent farther says that at Newport the Mate Josiah Lee, was by Order of Capt Collins taken out of sd Briga and confined in Irons on board the Nautilus, and continued loaded with Irons eleven Weeks after- wards, &amp; then was put on board his Majesties Ship the Boyne, and sent to England. -The pretence for this Severe Usage was an Information from a Mariner put on board the Briga that two other of sd Mariners had sollicited him to join with them to rescue sd Briga and likewise told him that sd Lee would join with them, which Charge the accused Seamen denied &amp; declared sd Lee never did say anything to them upon the Subject, &amp; sd Lee likewise denied that he had any Knowlege of a Design to rescue sd Briga or that he had ever said any thing upon the Subject to any person whatsoever </P>

<P>The deponent farther says that after the Arrival of said briga in the Harbour of Boston, she was libelled before Nathl Hatch Esqr Deputy Judge of the Admiralty, and after a long time condemned, but for what Cause this Deponent is ignorant, it was indeed given out that some Cotton wool he had on board was not shipped agreably to the provisions of the Act of Naviga- tion, but of this the Deponent was ignorant, he having cleared out sd Briga in Jamaica, as he had usually done in former Voyages, when no Exception had been taken either in the West Indies or here in the Custom Houses on the Continent </P>

<P>The deponent farther says that he continued &amp; was detained in Boston till about the 10th day of December last, when upon being informed by Capt Collins that he had Orders from the Admiral to put him on board the Preston then bound for England, as soon as the sales of the Briga and her Cargo were closed, he found Means to make his Escape to Dorchester point, and from thence returnd Home </P>

<P>finally this Deponent says that the Crew of said Brigantine when taken consisted of Josiah Lee, Mate, Eleazer read well,^ Jabez Perkins, John Pike, John Hall, Noadiah Bailey, Jeremiah Fullerton, and this Deponent; of </P>

<P>[New York] Die Lunae, A.M. March 4th, 1776. </P>

<P>Mr. [John Sloss] Hobart, from the committee appointed on Saturday last to call on Genl. Lee, to know the reason of the firing ,by the troops on persons coming to or going out of this city, and the reason of the interrup- tionigiven to the persons having passports from this Congress, delivered in their report in the words following, to wit: </P>

<P>The purport of the conversation betyeen ~eneral Lee and the committee </P>

<P>Genl. Lee says that he inhibited the communication with the ships of war and the Dutchess of Gordon, becaust he was informed that Govr. Tryon had seized a quantity of flour coming to this mar- ket, which he considered as a breach of the compact, which though not perhaps expressly made, yet was undoubtedly implied, that while we continued to supply them with provisions, they would not obstruct any coming to this market; that he wished the Con- gress would write to Govr. Tryon, and demand an explanation of his conduct; that if they should prefer the mode, he would write himself; that if upon settling the matter the Congress should in- cline to continue the daily supplies of provisions, he would give the necessary orders to the port-guard, provided no person from the shore should be allowed.to go on board the said ships, nor any per- son to come on shore from the same, as he could not permit a per- sonal communication to be any longer kept up. And as to the firing on the boats he assured the committee, that it was entirely owing to a misconstruction of his general orders; that if the Con- gress or any individual would draw up a set of instructions for the direction of the port-guard, that shall effectually prevent such in- convenience for the future, he would readily sign it. </P>

<P>Die Lunae, 3 h0.P.M. March 4th, 1776. A letter from Major-Genl. Lee, bearing date this day, was read and filed, and is in the words following, to wit: </P>

<P>MARCH 1776 </P>

<P>March 4th, 1776. Sir -The letters I received last night from the Commander-in- Chief and Gen. Green were unfortunately thrown into the fire; but according to the best of my recollection the reasons given by the generals for surmising, or rather concluding, that it was the inten- tion of the enemy to evacuate Boston, were these: That they had withdrawn their mortars and heavy cannon from Bunker's Hill and Charlestown; that their transports were hauled in to the wharves; that some people, who had left the town lately, declared that the officers' baggage was sent on board; in short, it is from every cir- cumstance concluded by those who are before the place, and those who have lately left the place that they are soon to abandon Bos- ton, and that consequently they will attempt to establish themselves here. May I, sir, take the liberty to express my uneasi- ness on a subject, which is more properly a matter of consideration for the Congress -the liberation of the notorious enemies of liberty and their country, on giving bonds for their good behaviour, appears to me, in our present situation, extremely ill imagined; it is so far from a security, that it is rather adding virus to their malignancy; the first body of troops that arrives will cancel those bonds -some vigorous decisive mode must be now adopted of discovering on whom you may depend -on whom not -the crisis will admit of no procrastination. I cannot, therefore, help wish- ing for the common safety and the honour of this Province, in particular, that some test may be immediately offered that we may be enabled to distinguish our friends from our foes -the latter must not and cannot be suffered to remain within your walls to co-operate with those without in working your destruc- tion. I am, sir [&amp;c.] Charles Lee. To Col. [Nathaniel] Woodhull, President of the Provincial Congress. Mr.Hobard, from the committee appointed to consider of the intelli- gence received from Major-Genl. Lee, by his letter above mentioned, deliv- ered in their report, which was read, and the same being read a second time, paragraph by paragraph, and amended, was approved of and unanimously agreed to in the words following, to wit: Your committee beg leave to report the following resolves. . . . 6th. That a letter be wrote to the committees of Sout[h] Hampton and East Hampton in Suffolk county, requesting them to station men at the most convenient places in that county to give the earliest notice of the arrival of a fleet upon the coast; and that upon the first appearance of a fleet they des- patch an express immediately to this.Congress or the Committee of Safety of </P>

<P>162 	AMERICAN THEATRE 
</P>

<P>this Colony, with an account of the number and size of the ships, and the course they steer. </P>

<P>7th. That the light-house at Sandy-Hook be dismantled, the lantern rendered useless, and all the oil and lamps taken and carried to some place of safety at a proper distance. .. . </P>

<P>Resolved, That, the Congress does agree with their committee in the said report. But as some of the resolves therein reported are very impor- tant. </P>

<P>Ordered, That the said report be reassumed and read to-morrow morn- ing, when the house' is full -and a charge of secrecy as to the light-house, was given from the %Chair. </P>

<P>A draft of a letter to the committee of East Hampton and to the com- mittee of Sout[h] Hampton, was read and approved of, and is in the words following, to wit: </P>

<P>In Provincial Congress, New-York, March 4th, 1776. </P>

<P>Sirs -This covers a resolution of Congress directing the committees </P>

<P>of East and South Hampton to station suitable persons on the most </P>

<P>proper places for observing the approach of a fleet. </P>

<P>From some intelligence we have received, there is reason to ex- </P>

<P>pect that the British army are about to leave Boston, and as it is </P>

<P>probable that they may attempt to take possession of this Colony, </P>

<P>we therefore entreat you to use all possible despatch to carry this </P>

<P>resolve into execution. </P>

<P>To John Chatfield, Esqr. East, and Thomas Cooper, Esqr. South </P>

One to John Chatfield, Esqr. chairman of the com- mittee of East Hampton, and the other to Thomas Cooper, Esqr. chairman of the committee of South Hampton, and that a certified copy of the sixth resolve reported by the committee on the news received by Genl.

<P>[Extract] Ph[iladelphi]a 4th March 1776. Dr Papa We got here Saturday evening about 4 o'clock -I shall give you a short acct of our journey: we crossed the bay in 2 hours and a half under a reefed foresail: there wasa very high swell in the bay &amp; we were both very sick: Ve got that evening to Chester town -the next day we set off facing a cold northwest wind we got no further Thursday then to Warwick 24 miles from Chester[town] -the roads were bad &amp; the weather intensily cold. . . . friday evening we got to Newcastle: the morning ride was cold, the eve- ning's comparatively mild. Saturday in a Packet boat at Newcastle having first engaged a man to carry our horses &amp; my chair to Green trees -I hope </P>

<P>they will get to Annapolis this evening. We had a plaisant sail from N.Cas- tle to this city: the distance by water' is 40 miles- we passed thro' the cheveaux de frize but could see nothing of them there is a chanel, or open- ing left of 70 feet wide for vessels to go thro': this on notice given of the ap- proach of the enemy will be obstructed by more chevaux defrize ready to be Sunk &amp; by a large boom &amp; chain: the row gallies will be stationed at the point of the Iland wh lies behind the chevaux de frize &amp; wch will protect them from the enemy's fire: There is a floating battery ready to be launched: I saw it as I Sailed up the river but at too great a distance to de- scribe it. I shall if I have time, go and examine it -They are building here 4 or 5 frigates: in Fact this city appears quite like a garrison -</P>

<P>Monday evening I have taken an agreeable morning walk. I went on board the floating battery. it will carry 10 18 pounders, and will draw 2.6 or 3 feet water -they have 13 row gallies, or gondolas, each of wh carry a 24 or 18 pounder. I went on board of one wh has a 24 pounder in the prow, &amp; sev-eral swivels. They lie low in the water: besides the floating battery &amp; row gallies, and a frigate of 24 guns, wh will be finished sometime next month, they have built Seve[ral] rafts, or flat bottom boats, wh are filled with com- bustibles &amp; Ankerd together with chains: these rafts, row gallies, and frigate are intended to protect the cheveaux de frize. They are building here for the Continent 4 frigates, of 24 &amp; 32 guns: they are fine Ships indeed, their timbers are all of cedar &amp; live oak- a 60 gun Ship may come up to the city: but the above impediments, it is thought, will render the attempt too hazardous I saw one of the cheveaux de frize: this is its form bd the projecting pieces at top are armed with iron spikes -I had the pleasure to see this morning a vessel come up to this port loaded with 27 Tons of Gun- powder, 5 tons of Saltpetre, 500 stand of arms, &amp; coarse linens to the amount [of] £600 ster[ling] prime cost this vessel came from Zealand -. . . </P>

<P>Gentlemen: On Board the Charming Nancy, March 4,1776. Immediately on our coming on board here, we wrote you a letter by return of the boat; but as we did not hear from you, and the unfortunate scene that afterwards ensued, we apprehend the letter has not reached you. We therefore beg leave to mention the purport of it. On our coming alongside, we were ordered on board, and examined by Captain [Andrew] Barkley and Major [James] Grant, with regard to our trrand. After informing them of this particular, we were confined to the </P>

<P>168 AMERICAN THEATRE 
</P>

<P>cabin. The above gentlemen have both declared, on their mutual faith and honour, it was never their order or intention to commit any act of hostility against this Province, nor do they even now mean any, unless drawn on by fresh provocation from you. They have both desired us to assure you, in the most solemn manner, that if any two gentlemen, such as the inhabitants most confide in, will come on board, they may inform themselves of the truth of what has been mentioned; and they pledge themselves, as above, to grant them permission to return when and where they please, unmolested. This, gentlemen, is the conversation that has passed, and beg leave to submit it to your consideration. </P>

<P>We further assure you, that we write without any constraint, or being any way dictated to; and the genteel treatment we have both received, en- courage us to place the greatest confidence in their assertions. We shall just add, that your deliberations on this matter may be productive of the most important consequences. Mr.Rice is with us, and treated very well. </P>

<P>We are, gentlemen, [&amp;c.] Raymond DemerC, Daniel Roberts. , To the Commanding Officer at Savannah. </P>

<P>[March 4, 1776.1 Colonel McIntosh's Answer. Dear Gentlemen: I received your letters of yesterday and to-day, and am authorized to tell you that, as you have been so shamefully treated, con- trary to the uniform practice of all civilized people, we will not risk the lib- erty of any more of our fellow-citizens, which they are unanimously de- termed, at all events, to sell with their lives. The manoeuvres of these gentlemen, their hostile appearance, with so many armed vessels and troops, stealing in the night on board the ships of those who have scandalously de- serted a people by whom they got their bread, in order to attack us, and their conduct with respect to you, evidently show their design against an in- nocent, peaceable people. We all earnestly wish you among us again; but are sure you would not desire your freedom on any conditions dishonoura- ble to your country. If they will withdraw their vessels and troops from annoying us, to Cockspur again, we authorize you to receive any proposition they may make. I am, [&amp;c.] </P>

<P>1. Force, comp., American Archives, 4th, V,600. </P>

<P>In Savannah River, March 4, 1776. Gentlemen: We just this moment received yours, and are authorized to inform you that, from the circumstance of our letter of yesterday not being answered, and your firing to-day, it was believed your intention was </P>

<P>MARCH 1776 </P>

<P>to treat his Majesty's sea and land forces in a hostile manner, notwith- standing the declaration made in our letter; but as the proposal made in your letter of this day intimates your disposition to act inoffenceably towards his Majesty's sea and land forces, if the vessels and troops are carried to Cockspur without annoying you, we are authorized to assure you that, consistently with the declarations made, the troops and vessels will be conducted to Cockspur immediately, without any act of hostility on their part, if not attacked; and an express-boat is to be sent to stop the firing below, not doubting but similar steps will be taken by you. We therefore flatter ourselves that you will pay due attention to the above, as we have pledged our words, in consequence of the above declaration, that every act of hostility will be refrained from by you. We are, gentlemen, [kc.] </P>

<P>. Raymond Demert, Daniel Roberts. </P>

<P>N. B. Captain Barkley has this moment despatched an express to the Cherokee,to stop firing. We beg the bearer may be permitted to return. </P>

<P>I. Force, comp., American Archives, 4th. V, 601. McIntosh accepted the proposal. </P>

<P>In the Council of Safety, Savannah. Gentlemen March 4, 1776. </P>

<P>The intimate Connection between this and your Province in a particu- lar Manner, renders it necessary to acquaint you with the Occurrences in the former, since the Date of our last; to which, and the Dispatche preceding, we refer you. </P>

<P>Our Dispositions in the Evening of the Zd, were such as appeared to our Officers the most likely to prevent the Landing of our Enemy; and so as, if they should make their Landing good, either above dr below the Town, to prevent their getting in; however, notwithstanding our Vigilance, they, by Collusion with the Masters and others on board the Merchant Shipping, which hawled near the Shore of Hutchinson's Island in the Night Time, got on board these Ships, about four o'clock yesterday Morning; to the Number, as far as we are competent to judge from the Observations we made, and the Intelligence we received, of between two and three hundred, where the af- fected to conceal theniselves. </P>

<P>We had our Fears respecting these Shipping, and therefore kept a good Watch upon them; but it was impossible for Centinels, on this Shore, to des- cry them in boarding from the other, the Vessels being betwixt. </P>

<P>Capt. Rice, who commanded a Boat of Observation, was sent on board the Shipping about nine o'clock, to order the Rigging on Shore, and was, without any Noise, or the smallest Knowledge of us, kidnapped. This we did not know till about half an Hour afterwards: Two Sailors, under Pre- tence of coming on shore for Cloaths, gave Information of the Troops being on board the Shipping, and of Rice's being taken. About three hundred Men were then immediately marched to Yamacraw, opposite the Shipping, with three 4 Pounders, and threw up a Breastwork. The armed Schooner </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>Hinchinbrook, of -Guns, with a Number of Men on board, which, with others, went up the Back River, in the Afternoon of the Day preceding, about this Time set sail down to the South River, with Intent, no Doubt, of covering the Landing of the Troops, from on board the Merchant Shipping: But being continually fired at, by two Companies of Riflemen who were placed in Ambuscade, she was obliged to come very slowly, and of- ten came to, and returned a very smart Fire at the every place where the Ri- flemen fired from, until the Tide was spent, and she could not go down. During the Course of this firing, only one of our Men got wounded, and that slightly in the Thigh; but on board, several men were seen to fall. </P>

<P>In Town we had exhibited a still more interesting Scene. We.found the Officers and Men clamorous, about the Capture and Detention of Rice; and two Gentlemen, Lieut. Daniel Roberts, of the %.John's Rangers, and Mr. Raymond Demerk of Saint Andrew's Parish, solicited, and were permit- ted, to go on board, to Demand a surrender of Rice and his People. They accordingly divested themselves of Arms, and were rowed by a Negro on board the Vessel, in which were, Capt. Barclay, the Commodore, and Major [James] Grant; and these Officers, contrary to all the Principles which ce- ment Society, and govern Mankind, immediately arrested ou; Deputies, and yet detain them as Prisoners. We waited with anxious Expectation for near half an Hour, when we demanded our Deputies, by the Help of a Trumpet, without getting any other, but insulting Answers; whereupon we fired two 4 ~oundkrs directly into them; and then they informed us, that they would send an Answer in Writing; which they presently after did, signed by Lieut. Roberts and Mr.Demer6, purporting, that if we would send two of the Per- sons in whom the People most confided, they would treat with them. , </P>

<P>Capt.[James] Screven, of the St.John's Rangers, and Capt. [John] Baker, of the St.John's Rifle-men, chagrined no doubt, the former particularly, on Account of his Lieutenant, by detention of our Deputies, took about a Dozen of Rifle-men in a Boat, and rowed directly under the Stern of Capt. Inglis, in whose Vessel were a great Part of the Soldiery, and, in peremptory Terms, demanded the Deputies, and were answered, after one Shot from Col. Baker, by a Discharge, down directly upon them, of near two hundred Shot, both from Swivels and small Arms, which was kept up while they were in Reach; the Captains and Men in the Boat, not in the smallest Degree confused, or even, perhaps, disappointed by the Attack, fired their Rifles, most of them three several times, and as they say, not without Execution; and wonderful to tell! not a Man of them killed; one Man only received a Slug in the fleshy part of his Shoulder, which was immediately cut out, without the smallest Inconvenience or Danger. The Spectators declare, as we now do, that such a providential Deliverance has not yet been known. </P>

<P>This unmanly Attack, upon a few Men in an open Boat, produced a </P>

<P>general Fire from our Field Pieces and Intrenchments; and as smart -</P>

<P>Return from two 4 Pounders and several Swivels from the Shipping; which </P>

<P>lasted from about Twelve o'clock to Four; and although they often fired </P>

<P>langridge, which continually whistled about our Men, not a single Man </P>

<P>MARCH 1776 </P>

<P>was even touched; but we have no doubt, a Number of the Enemy met with a worse Fate, as they were seen frequently to fall. </P>

<P>About Four o'clock we called a Council, and determined to have the ' Vessels immediately burnt; and issued orders to Col. [Lachlan] M'Intosh ac- cordingly: Whereupon the Inverness, late Capt. M'Gillivray, loaded with Rice and Deer-Skins, was set on Fire, and cut loose. Upon this, the Sol- diers, in the most laughable Confusion, got a shore in the Marsh; while our Rifle-men and Field pieces, with Grape Shot, were incessantly galling them. The Shipping were now also in Confusion, some got up the River, under cover of the Armed Schooner, while others caught the Flame, and, as Night approached, exhibited a Scene, as they passed and repassed with the Tide, which, in any but the present Times, would be truly horrible, but now a subject only of Gratulation and Applause. </P>

<P>The Ships of Capt. Inglis and Wardwell, neither got up the River, or on Fire; they were ordered on Shore, and now are Prisoners of Capt. Screven in the Country, and their Vessels brought down close in to a Wharf. They were permitted to write to Capt. Barclay in the Evening, to inform him of their situation, and to request an Exchange of Prisoners, which the latter peremptorily refused. </P>

<P>We have thus given you a particular Detail of Things, as they really happened, to prevent the Belief of any erroneous Intelligence; and, from which you will be competent to judge of our Situation. </P>

<P>Col. M'Intosh laid before the Board, a Resolution of your Congress to aid us, accompanied by a Letter from Mr.[Rawlins] Lowndes; and we are very glad you have determined to afford us further Assistance. We wish it may arrive in Time. </P>

<P>[New Providence, March 4, 17761 . . . The next m[orning] by break of day we marched for the town of Nassau, where the G[overnor llived, which was 4 miles from the fort. we arrived within [a mile,] wh[en] we halted about one hour, and had a parley, when the [gate] of the Capital fort, Nassau, was opend, and the British col- [ors] hauled down, and we took possession. The Commodore and [our vessels lay] back of Hog Island, but in about 2 hours after, they came in[to] the harbour, and as the Commodore was landing, we saw Governor [Mont- fort Browne] and his council walking his Piazza, and his servants waiting bel[ow with horlses. Capt. Hen[r]y Dayton, who command[ed] the other company, and myself, Asked Major Nichols [Samuel Nicholas] liberty [to go an]d take him. The Major informed us he had no orders from the [Com- modbre to] take him, but we may do as we pleased. Capt. Henry Day[ton] and a young officer from Philadelphia and myself went to the [Governor's holuse and informed him he must go with us to the fort, he sai[d in] reply that it was beneath his dignity, as Governor, to go to the f[ort.] We made him this reply that he must go, then he says it must [be by] the force of arms, We told him it was by the force of arms! In a short time Corn. Hopkins and the Captains of the fleet landed and came to the fort. After some time spe[nt,] the Commodore sent for me, and gave me orders to take as many men as would be sufficient, and keep the Governor prisoner in his own house. .. . </P>

<P>[Cambridge] 5th. [March, 17761 The British, it was expected, would attempt to dislodge the Americans from Dorchester heights. Signals had been prepared at Roxbury meeting- house to mark the moment. The detachment at Cambridge (designed to push into Boston in the boats) was paraded, not far from No.2, where it re- mained a good part of the day. But kind Heaven, which more than once saved the Americans when they would have destroyed themsel~es,~ </P>

<P>did not allow the signals to be made. About 3500 of the British troops, it was said, had been sent down to the Castle, with the intent to have made an attack on the Americans; but about midnight the wind blew almost a hurricane from the south; many windows were forced in, sheds and fences blown down, and some vessels drove on shore; and no attempt was made on the works. </P>

<P>As Major-General [Charles] Lee has cut off all communication with said ship, and through his conduct and orders the passports of this Congress are of no avail, the Congress refused to give permission. </P>

<P>SHULDHAM </P>

<P>Roebuck at Hampton ,Road in </P>

<P>Virginia the 5th March 1776. Sir The Squadron of his Majesty's Ships stationed here being in great want of Provisions, Stores and other necessaries, and having no prospect of any supply but from Boston, I find my self under the absolute necessity of send- ing the Kingsfisher to inform you of our situation, Altho' 'tis sorely against my will to part with her from hence at this juncture. </P>

<P>Since the burning of the Town of Norfolk all civil communication with the Shore has been at an end, and very little Provisions by any means of any sort has been procured: The Contractors for Victualling the Navy could no longer supply the Ships, and had it not been for a vessel that was stopped by one of the Tenders in January last laden with Flour, Lord Dunmore the Governor would not have been able to have subsisted the people he has afloat with him untill this time. </P>

<P>We are also greatly in want of Slops of all kinds; as I found the Ships here entirely without them, I have been under the necessity of supplying them from the Roebuck. </P>

<P>Enclosed is an account of the State and Condition of the Ships under my command, together with a Journal of my proceedings since I received Vice Admiral Graves' Orders of the 25th december. Also an account of the Vessels that have been seized and detained by his Majesty's Ships here; the list I believe is complete except those taken by the Otter, and as Captain [Matthew] Squire is on a cruize, and has omitted leaving an acct of them with me, I must defer sending it untill a future opportunity, but I under-stand they amount to only four or five small vessels of little value: It is im- possible to send such round to Boston as it would employ our men to very little purpose; And as we have no judge of the Admiralty here, nor Commis- sioners for prizes, I shall be glad, Sir, to have your Orders concerning them. </P>

<P>I likewise transmit you, Sir, a particular account of what the Liverpool is in want of. I am prevented from sending you the same from the Otter, for the reason above mentioned, but Captain Squire informed me before he sailed that he was in want of every kind of Store, leaving with me the en- closed memorandm of his decayed Cables and Sails. </P>

<P>I beg leave Also to acquaint you, Sir, that I have given Mr Charles Fletcher Surgeon of the Roebuck, who is also I believe a good Physician an order to receive on Shore the Sick Men from the Ships in the usual manner of sick quarters, which I hope you will approve of. The Ague and fever on board the Otter had shewn itself to be epidemick, and many died of it, but I have the pleasure to tell you that since I got them ashore the disease has sub- sided, and they are most of them in a fair way of recovery. </P>

<P>Lieutenant [John] Orde of his Majestys Ship under my command hav- ing when commanding officer on board at Halifax confined the Boatswain . for bad behavior, I applied to commodore Arbuthnot for a Court-martial to </P>

<P>MARCH 1776 </P>

<P>be held on him, but during the time I remained there, it could never be as- sembled for want of a sufficient number of Captains: I therefore took the Opportunity of the Mercury's calling in here to Order a Court-martial for his trial, when the charge was proved and the Boatswain was dismised the Service. Since which I have given an Order to Alexander Forbes (a Brisk active Boatswains Mate) to do that duty, whom I beg leave to recommend to you for promotion. </P>

<P>I hope my having detained the Liverpool here will meet with your ap- probation and that it will be in your power to send me the Supply's the Ships here are so much in want of. I have the honor to be.Sir &amp;ca &amp;ca </P>

<P>MASTER Joseph </P>

<P>New Hanover county [North Carolina]. William Raddon, of the city of Philadelphia, mariner, maketh oath on the holy evangelists of Almighty God, that he sailed from Philadelphia, the eleventh of February last, as master of the sloop Joseph, bound for South- Carolina or Georgie. That on the thirteenth following he was taken by the sloop General Gage, on board of which was Capt. [John] Collett, and brought into Cape-Fear. That Lieutenant Pitcairn informed this deponent, that every transport vessel that was to come from England was to bring one or more flat bottomed boats. That this deponent has seen the deposition of Peter Simon, made this day, and was informed by Captain Collett of the sev- eral circumstances therein mentioned. That Lieutenant Osborne, of the Raven sloop of war, informed this deponent, that there were to be sixty sail of armed vessels, of different sizes, stationed on the coast, and twenty sail of twenty gun ships and sloops of war were to be on the coast from England in April; and that bomb-ketches were to be brought out, to throw bombs into those places where ships of war could not go up, and were particularly in- tended against Philadelphia, because the Congress sits there; and that he made his escape with Mr.Simon and others. William Raddon. Sworn to before me, the fifth of March, 1776. William Purviance. John Cooke, Secretary. William.Raddon, within named, farther deposeth, and saith, that on or about the 27th of February, this deponent being then on board the Falcon sloop of war, Capt. Lindsey [John Linzee], and Lieut. Wright, who com- mands an armed sloop, declared that they had intended that night to go up to the town of Brunswick, with about an hundred sailors, to set the town on fire in front, station their men on the back of the town, and destroy man, </P>

<P>woman and child, that escaped from the flames; but the reason they did not put their design in execution was, that the sloop commanded by Lieut. Wright got aground when she went out to examine what vessel the sloop General Gage was, and that afterwards Lindsey told Wright that the inhabit- ants had left the town, and therefore it was of no use to burn it. </P>

<P>While North Carolina on one side &amp; Georgia on the other is attacked, &amp; we, who are most loudly threatned, are left in a seeming State of tranquility, what conclusion can be drawn not surely that we are protected by our In- nocence, but that Vengeance is preparing for us, to be brought on when our friends shall be rendered incapable of affording us assistance -from every consideration therefore it behoves these three Colonies to act with great war- iness &amp; foresight always on the defensive. -but let us act with Resolution &amp; divine providence will bless our actions with success -</P>

<P>Savannah, March 5, 1776. Gentlemen: When I authorized Messrs. DemerC and Roberts, by my letter of yesterday, to inform you that orders were given for a cessation of arms on our side, we certainly expected you would consider it as implied that those gentlemen, together with Mr. Rice, should be immediately re- leased; for surely it must appear to every man that the detention of our fellow-citizens is, to all intents and purposes, a continuation of hostilities on your side. I am now directed to acquaint you that the people have waited with the utmost anxiety for the arrival of those gentlemen all this day; and I am induced to think, from your professions of a friendly disposition, that </P>

<P>Duplicate No 3. My Lord Your Lordship's Commands of 23d December No 1. I have the honour to receive, and am exceedingly happy my Endeavours to dispatch the Detachment of His Majestys Troops to Lord Dunmore, have enabled his Lordship to effect useful Services for the King. It is always an inward heartfelt Comfort and Satisfaction to be assured that one's Endeavours to forward His Majesty's Service, meets with His Majesty's Approbation -</P>

<P>The Hinchinbrook Schooner arrived on the 20th of last Month from Boston. By the Dispatches I have received from General Howe, I fear sev- eral of my Dispatches to the Commander in Chief have miscarried, they were all sent to Lord Dunmore,' except one which was sent by a Vessel from hence the beginning of November, that I contrived to get loaded with Or- anges Honey and Live Stock for Boston, but we have not heard My Lord of this Vessel since she sailed out of this Port. </P>

<P>The Hinchinbrook brought me Letters from Captain PAndrew] Barkley of the Scarborough, and Major [James] Grant of the 40th Regiment, who are detached with four Men of War and a Command of Troops to procure Pro- visions on the Coast of Georgia. </P>

<P>I sent to them with all dispatch every Assistance I could think of, Pilots for the Coasts that are acquainted with all the Plantations on the Islands and on the Main, and Vessels that they might employ, and every Informa- tion that I could imagine would tend to facilitate the Service they were upon. A Transport Ship from England arrived the 22d of last Month with Captain Van Braam, and on the 28th another with Lieut. Vanipper and Re- cruits for the 60th Regiment. I have the honour to enclose Your Lordship a State of them; there is as yet My Lord no appearance of the Companies from St Vincents. </P>

(Who says He entered on board the Sloop Batchellor John Scott Master at and belonging to Virginia the 21st December 1775; The Sloop was then loading with Flour kc; and declared to be going to Barbadoes. She Sailed from Virginia tile 1st January 1776, and when at Sea the Master declared He intended for Martinico) &quot;The 10th February 1776. The Sloop ~atchellorJohn Scott Master from Virginia with a Loading of flour &amp;c. arrived at St Pierres Martinique&quot; (and was immediately Seized and Con- fiscated; as was said, for a breach of the French Laws; however said Sloop) &quot;was purchased by a Monsieur Begoraux, for Account of Mr Richard Har- rison, an Agent there for the Continental Congress, and is now Loading with Gunpowder, Arms, kc; to carry back to America.&quot; &quot;The 23d February 1776. The Sloop Molly, Richard Conway Master belonging to North America, Sailed from St Pierres, Martinique, having on board 500.

<P>[Camp before Boston1 Mch. On the night of the 1st &amp; 2d of March our batteries both on the Roxbury &amp; Cambridge side commenced &amp; continued discharge of shott &amp; shells on the town, some of the balls fell in the town, for after we had entered it a gentlemen, in whose house Genl. [Robert] Pigot had lodged, shewed me the hole where one of the cannon balls had pass'd a little way over his bed which he was Mch. 3d sleeping in. a fourteen inch mortar which among other mili- 1776 tary stores was captured in the ord'nance brig [Nancy] by Capt. Manly-was burst in firing from our lines on the enemy in Boston. we had set a high value on it -call'd it the Congress. it wounded one or two in bursting, but killed none. during our fire -on the night of the 4th of March a detach- ment from our army moved on to the hights of Dorchester point -this is also a peninsula joined to the main by a narrow neck; on this was placed -on the side looking toward the enemy </P>

<P>-a line of bundles of pressed hay to defend our troops from the enemies fire while passing it. </P>

<P>This detachment proceeded to the top of the hill and imme- diately commenced making a redoubt, entrenching tools &amp; facines being carried there &amp; ready: the next morning at 8 oClock a relief was sent on -of which I was one -in passing the neck the tide having overflowed it I found my boots filled with mud and water, but we had no dry clothes with us, nor any time or opportunity for changing. </P>

<P>Of this event I think some remarks more than a mere passing notice are proper. . . . Having carried you to the top of the hill on Dorchester point I found a redoubt considerably advanced in a position well calculated for defence. Outside the parapet were casks filled with sand and so placed that a slight touch would set them rolling down the hill which was very steep on every side, and thus break the ranks of the enemy on their advance. On the afternoon of the 6th' we very plainly saw the enemy in motion in the town: dense columns of troops moving down the main street to the wharf and embarking on board the ships which moved down the harbor and formed in a kind of crescent at considerable distance from the hill. </P>

<P>190 	AMERICAN THEATRE 
</P>

<P>most of the next day was spent by those ships in beating up nearer to our post -the wind being a head: we continued our work incessantly in compleating the redoubt, being urged to exertion by a full expectation of being attacked by the enemy's troops we had seen embark on board the ships; we had no time to spare for reflecting on and counting the cost of the issue of the expected battle. we did not work litterally with arms in our hands, but they were lying by our sides, and it is presumed that every one ardently wished for the opportunity of shewing the enemy what freemen would do when contending for their just rights. No one needed stimulating to the performance of his duty as every one possessed the inclination. </P>

<P>As night approached an uncommonly severe South East rain storm came on with very high wind, and in that elevated situa- tion, surrounded by the sea, it was felt in all. its force, but the severity of the storm did not stop our work, which we pushed forward with the utmost alacrity. The next morning presented to the view of the enemy a regular fort, far advanced to com- pletion -and to our view their ships below apparently in a very disorderly condition: the day passed without any thing worthy of particular notice. You may form some faint idea of our situation; thoroughly drenched by the copious rain, exhausted by severe exertion and want of refreshment, &amp; of course without cover. </P>

<P>At evening we broke ground on Nook, or Nuke point, a small hill very near the water oposite South Boston. The enemy could plainly hear the sound of our entrenching tools, on which they opened and continued an incessant cannonade with a general direction towards this point. I counted the number of discharges up to.about 1500 during half an hour and then left off counting; this firing was continued through the night, and the morning shewed a novel sight; the ground all around where the work had been carrying on appeared as if it had been plowed irregu- larly, and a very great number of cannon balls were picked up; but strange as it may seem there was but a surgeons mate and two privates killed during the night. </P>

<P>[Extract] Albany arch 6th 1776. Sir. Instead of one hundred and twenty Sleds to convey the Cannon and provision from Fort George Tyconderoga &amp;c to Canada, with the utmost Ef- forts only seventy six could be procured, the great Scarcity of Forrage and Danger of going at this advanced Season deters them.The winter here is entirely broke up, and I believe Hudsons River will be clear of Ice in a few Days: It may be best therefore that the Remainder of the Troops from New Jersey and Pennsylvania should embark at New Windsor or still lower down, if Craft can be procured. Only one Company of Colo: [Charles] Burrel's Regiment is gone past here; I greatly fear that the Remainder will not be able to pass the Lakes on Ice unless a sudden Change in the Weather takes place: some Horses and one Man have already been drowned on Lake George and Lake Champlain </P>

<P>-It would be happy for us if the Lakes immediately opened, as I have got Matters in such a Way that I can immediately send on the Troops by Water but should the Lakes become impassable in any Way, I must of Necessity detain the Troops at this place until they open, as well to save the Expenditures of what pork we have at Fort George as that they cannot be quartered there. </P>

<P>The Sleds that left this, with the last Pennsylvania Company I am this Moment informed are returned not being able to proceed further than twenty Miles from this: Hudsons River being broke up there but as yet im- passable. </P>

<P>Mr.Nichs Low attended and informed the Committee [sic kongress] that a vessel was arrived with about 1,500 lb. of gunpowder, consigned to him for sale. </P>

<P>Ordered, That Mr. [Joseph] Hallett and Mr. [Thomas] Randall be a committee to agree with Mr.Low about the price of said powder, and pur- chase the same in behalf of this Congress. </P>

<P>Mr.Hallett and Mr. Randall reported that Mr.Low demanded £30 per cwt. for his powder, with permission to export produce at the rate of £40 for each hundred weight. The Congress directed Mr. Hallett and Mr. Randall to purchase the gunpowder as cheap as they can agree; but if Mr. Low should insist on £30 per cwt. for the purchase money, that he be al- lowed to export produce only to the same amount. </P>

Lee was pleased to give for answer, that he was to resign the command here to Lord Stirling this night, but that if he was to continue he would not consent to supply them with any provisions, as they were at open war with us; that he hoped Lord Sterling would be of the same opinion; that his instructions from Continental Congress were, to use every means in his power for the de- fence of the city. </P>

<P>New-York, 6th March, 1776. Sir -The Provincial Congress of this Colony having appointed us a committee to concert measures for carrying into execution their re- solve of the 5th inst. for the dismantling the light-house at Sandy- Hook; we, reposing especial trust and confidence in your abilities and zeal in the common cause, have made choice of you for the ex- ecution of that important enterprise. We enclose you a certified copy of the resolve for that purpose, and desire you will conform, as nearly as may be, to the strict letter thereof. You will please to call upon the committee of Middletown, or such other place in New-Jersey as you shall judge most proper, for the assistance you shall think necessary. Upon your arrival at Sandy Hook you will endeavour to take the glass out of the lantern, and save it if possi- ble; but if you find this impracticable you will break all the glass. You will also endeavour to pump the oil out of the cisterns into casks and bring it off; but if you should be obstructed by the enemy, or not be able to procure casks, you will pump it out on the ground. In short you will use your best discretion to render the light-house entirely useless. We are, sir [kc.] Pierre Van Cortlandt, Abm. P. Lott, John Sloss Hobart, To Major Malco[l]m </P>

<P>New-York, March 6. We are informed b; a Captain of a vessel from Rhode-Island, that last week Capt. [James] Wallace landed his Marines on Conanicut in the eve- ning, and began,to burn the buildings, but being discovered by one of the Centinels, a number of our people concealed themselves behind the walls and fences until they came near them; but the commander thinking it un- fair to fire on them without giving them notice, called out, &quot;Who comes there,&quot; when he heard Wallace order his men to make ready, upon which our party instantly fired among them, and killed and wounded 30 of Wal- lace's people; among the slain was an officer of Marines and the Drummer, who was killed by Wallace's side, which was plainly seen by the light of the houses on fire. Those that were not wounded of Wallace's party retreated on board the ship with greater haste than they landed. Wednesday last [February 281 Wallace and his fleet went down the Bay to Rhode-Island, on which they gave him a cannonading as he passed, and on Saturday he returned again, when they paid him the same comp1iment.l </P>

<P>It is of great Importance that your Militia should be well armed S. equipped &amp; Powder is essentially necessary -without it what will be the Dis- tresses of the Sea Coast Frontiers &amp; how can they defend themselves?

<P>to the Commander of a Ship arrived in this place, &amp; find that Capt Johnson was waiting for his Crew, which had been dispatched from Bilbao by Messrs Guad -[Joseph Gardoqui and Sons] ten Days before &amp; ought to have ar- rived in two or three at most. He was very uneasy Sc intended to get anoth- er Crew if his own did not arrive soon, &amp; I have since heard a Rumor that the Vessel is detained wch there is Reason to fear. she had on board four hundred &amp; thirty barells Powder, or in other Words twenty one Tons &amp; an half &amp; should she arrive will clear for the Colony seven thousand five hun- dred Pounds lawful estimating the powder @ 51 p pound which is low -but this a trifling Consideration compared with other Advantages -five Tons were ordered to Cambridge abt a Week since from the Jerseys since which twenty seven Tons &amp; an half have arrived here wth about five Tons Saltpetre &amp; 300 stand arms . . .News is just arrived of five Tons more Powder imported into North Carolina, &amp; each Colony looks out for itself as the Times re- quire it -</P>

<P>Philadelphia March 6th 1776 Sir Upon the recommendation given of you by the Virginia Delegates, and in consequence of the Agreement made by Mr J.H.Norton Mr C.M.Thrus- ton &amp; yourself with the Committee of Safety of Virginia for Importing Gun Powder, we have agreed to join you in the said Importation by adding an equal Sum to what those Gentlemen &amp; yourself advance for the Execution of this Adventure, you inform us you are possessed of good bills of Exchange to the Amount of Nine hundred &amp;.one pounds 8/5 Sterling to be applyed by you in the purchase of Powder to answer the Contract you have made, we therefore deliver you herewith bills of Exchange amounting to Nineteen hundred &amp; one Pounds 17/11 Sterling to be joined to your said Stock and employed by you for the same purpose, consequently Mr Norton, Mr ~hruston&amp; yourself are one half concerned in this Undertaking, and we hold the other half, unless it shall so happen that any of the said bills deliv- ered you by them or us may be protested, and in that case the party who fur- nished such protested bills must be so much less interested in this Adventure, this point being clearly understood &amp; agreed between us, you are now to take your passage on board the Brigt Rachael Capt. Francis Pil- grim Isherwood for Bourdeaux in France and we deliver you herewith a Letter of Recommendation to Messrs Sam: &amp; J H Delap an eminent Mercan- tile House in that place; before you mention to them what is your business, it may be best to know their political Sentiments respecting the American Dispute, if they are friendly to our Cause you may trust them safely, if they are not it may be best to find out some good House that is, in this -200 AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>Matter you had best consult with and be advised by Mr Silas Deane who has promised me to afford you any Assistance he can </P>

<P>Your first business must be to discover if the Quantity of Powder you want can be had reasonably at Bourdeaux, if it can the next thing is to ob- tain freight for it to Martinico, and if that can also be obtained we think your best Method will be to purchase directly the whole Quantity that can be obtained for the Money or bills you have, if you have an Oppertunity ship to the Amot of one or two to three hundred barrells by such Vessells as may be coming hither direct, taking bills of Loading for the same Con-signed to us, one of which Bills of Loading with an Invoice &amp; letter of Ad- vice send us by each Vessell and if we are fortunate enough to receive the whole or any part of what you ship it shall be sent down to Mr Norton immediately -</P>

<P>The remainder of your purchase if made in France we advise you to ship immediately on bd some good French Vessell at the lowest freight you can obtain for the Island of Martinico and take your passage with it but in this case Messrs Delap or whoever transacts your business must recommend you to a good House in Martinico, and the Powder by bill of Loading In- voice &amp; suitable letter must go consigned to such House, another letter to be kept by you must explain the design and recommend you to their Assist- ance you must also write a letter to us informing that you have taken your passage for Martinico (not mentioning Powder) and desire we should write to you under Cover of that House mentioning their Firm -</P>

<P>If you cannot effect this business at Bourdeaux but can do it at any other port in France, Messrs Delap will give or procure you letters to proper persons at such port or ports as may be needful, or shoud it be best to ship part of the Powder from one Port &amp; part from another, they will procure that to be done and you can take your passage in one of the Vessells -Shoud you find that this business cannot be well transacted in France, you had best proceed for Holland, we give you herewith a letter of Introduction to Messrs Geo: Clifford &amp; Teysett of Amsterdam, but we don't know their political Creed respecting America, therefore you had best proceed cautiously with them also, and for fear of disappointment obtain letters from Messrs Delap to some good Dutch Houses in Amsterdam &amp; Rotterdam, and we think you will certainly have it in your power to prevail with some of them to ship your whole quantity of Powder by one or more Vessells for St Eustatia Con- signed to a good Dutch House in that Island you going with it or with some of it and giving us Advice as before, but to prevent Mistakes in case you go for St Eustatia call on Messrs Robert &amp; Corns Stevenson Merchants there for any letters we may have lodged there for you and we think this Powder may </P>

<P>as well go for their Address -Shoud you fail of obtaining the business to be done in Holland, you must obtain proper letters to good Houses in Ham- burgh Dantzig or any other suitable place in Europe and from some of them you certainly will obtain the Powder and .proper Newtral or foreign Ships to carry it to. Martinico or St Eustatia, therefore we shall take it for granted that you will succeed, and expect you will be in one of those Islands in five </P>

<P>MARCH 1776 201 </P>

<P>or six Months from this time, and we will send one or two small Vessells to St Eustatia about that time to wait your Orders, therefore if you gc, to Mar- tinico or any other Island you must immediately after your Arrival give No- tice to Messrs Robert &amp; Corns Stevenson to send the Vessells over to you from St Eustatia -</P>

<P>We think it best you shoud Invest the whole Amount of your Money in Powder rather than in any of the other Articles mentioned in your Agree- ment with the Committee of Safety, because the price of this is fixed and those are not, but if you cannot get Powder we agree that you shoud Invest this Money in Arms, Salt Petre &amp; a proportion of Sulphur say %th as much Sulphur as Salt Petre and some Jesuit's Bark or if you cannot Invest the whole Money in the Articles already mentioned, you may invest the rest in such coarse linens &amp; woollen Goods as you judge will best answer in America and bring them in the Mode pointed out for the Powder -</P>

<P>If any difficulty arises about negotiating your bills we think you had best indorse them to Mr Delap let him negotiate them &amp; wait until1 they are accepted after which he may establish you a Credit in Holland for the Amount if you are obliged to go there or further -We are Sir [&amp;c.] </P>

<P>South-Carolina. Charles-Town, March 5, 1776. </P>

<P>By Authority of Congress. 
To the Honourable the Council of Safety for Georgia. 
Gentlemen, 
</P>

<P>Your letters of the 1st and 2d instant, and your resolutions, order, and proclamation of those dates, were laid before the Congress, transfusing a general and perfect joy. -And the Congress, sensible of the vast importance which your exemplary conduct must be of to the American cause, unanimously voted their thanks; and I have the honour thus to transmit them to you, for your having decis- ively taken the noble, politic, and vigorous resolution, That the vessels in the ports of Savannah, ready to sail, contrary to the inter- est of America, shall be forthwith unrigged and unruddered; and that, rather than the enemy shall possess those vessels and your capital, all shall perish in a noble conflagration, lighted by yourselves -an instance of heroic principle, not exceeded by any, and equalled but by few, in history. </P>

<P>Your conduct, in citing such of the inhabitants of Savannah, as had abandoned their possessions in that town, to return to its de- fence, under penalty of being deemed to have deserted such pro- perty, and of being excluded from any support toivards obtaining an indemnification for any loss they may sustain by a general con- flagration, received the highest applause, as being worthy of imita- tion -The policy and justice of the measure are equally con-spicuous. </P>

<P>In short, the Congress feel the greatest satisfaction, from their having anticipated your call for assistance; it is sufficient that we know our friends stand in need of our aid. We hope, that our forces under Col. [Stephen] Bull, will fully accommodate your ne- cessities: And you may rest assured, that we shall continue to afford the friends of America, in Georgia, every support in our power. </P>

<P>On Board the Hinchinbrook, March 6, 1776. Sir: Your letter of the 5th March came to hand this morning, about half an hour ago; and we must observe, that the gentlemen whose release you desire were aboard ship at the time that you signified to Mr. Demerd that, if the vessels and troops were withdrawn to Cockspur, without annoy- ing the people of the Province, these gentlemen were authorized to receive any propositions that might be made. And, in a subsequent letter, you inti- mated that there should be a cessation of hostilities, and not a single shot fired unless we annoyed you. On this ground we set out, and are resolved religiously to observe the conditions mentioned. We will proceed to Cock- spur without offence to the Province, if we are not fired on, and are to ex- pect the same punctual performance of your engagements. But after our arrival at Cockspur, (as we are determined to act up to our declarations on coming here,) if you, any gentleman, or gentlemen, properly authorized, will come down and suggest a plan that can accommodate all parties, by a re- lease of the ships now at Savannah, and their masters, we give you our word of honour that you, or them, shall be perfectly safe, and return when they please, as this method seems most likely to bring matters to the issue that you wish for. In the mean time, if hostilities commence, they must be im- puted to the people of Georgia, not to us, as we are determined to act up to the proposal made to us. </P>

<P>As Mr. Demerk is in a ship that has fallen down the Back-River, his let- ter shall be conveyed to him, and his answer sent on shore. We are, sir, w.1 </P>

<P>On board the Hinchinbrook, March 6, 1776. Dear Sir: I was this morning sent for by Captain .Barkley and Major Grant, who presented me with your letter of yesterday to them: in answer to which, I must observe, that, when you authorized Mr. Roberts and myself to declare to those gentlemen that a cessation of hostilities should cease until the vessels got down to Cockspur, I did not imagine it implied that we should have liberty to return. I therefore particularly request you will do nothing till we reach Cockspur. By that time you can consider what is best to be done; and everything in our power will be exerted to bring matters to some favourable issue. With regard to Captains Inglis and Wardell being detained, I most earnestly wish they may be included with the other masters of vessels, to have the liberty of sailing with their ships. I imagine Captain Barkley and Major Grant will expect those gentlemen are entitled to the same indulgence as the others; and as I am now very confident no hostilities are meant against the Province, the detention of those vessels may only ag- gravate matters, and their enlargement may be productive of something very agreeable in the event. I have just to conclude, with my usual esteem and regard, dear sir, [&amp;c.] Raymond Demerk. </P>

<P>P. S. I have just had intimation of some intrenchment being thrown up at or near Mr. Bryan's Plantation. If so, I sincerely wish it may be stopped, as it can answer no good purpose. I would rather suffer every inconven- ience from my confinement than any further hostilities should be com-menced; for I would, in that case, think myself partly the cause. </P>

<P>[Extract] Cambridge March 7. 1776 Sir, On the 26. Ulto I had the honour of addressing you and there men- tioned that we were making preparation for taking possession of Dor-chester Heights. -I now beg leave to Inform you, that a Council of General Officers having determined a previous Bombardment &amp; Cannonade expe- dient &amp; proper in order to harrass the Enemy and divert their attention from that Quarter, on Saturday Sunday, and Monday nights last, we carried them on from our posts at Cobble Hill, Letchmore's point &amp; Lams Dam -Whether they did the Enemy any considerable &amp; what Injury I have not yet heard, but have the pleasure to acquaint you that they greatly facili- tated our Scheme, &amp; wou'd have been attended with success equal to our most sanguine expectations, had It not been for the unlucky bursting of Two Thirteen &amp; three Ten Inch Mortars, among which was the Brass one taken in the Ordnance Brigg -To what cause to attribute this Misfortune I know not, whether to any defect in them, or to the Inexperience of the Bombardiers. -But to return, on Monday Evening as soon as our firing com- menced, a considerable detachment of our men under the command of Brigadier Genl. Thomas crossed the Neck and took possession of the TWO Hills without the least interruption or annoyance from the Enemy, and by their great activity and Industry, before the morning advanced the Works so far, as to be secure against their Shot -They are now going on with such ex- pedition that in a little time I hope they will be compleat, and enable our Troops stationed there, to make a vigorous and Obstinate stand -during the whole Cannonade, which was Incessant the two last nights, we were fortu- nate enough to lose but two men, One a Lieutenant by a Cannon Ball's tak- ing off his thigh, the other a private by the explosion of a shell which also slightly wounded four or five more. Our taking possession of Dorchester Heights is only preparatory to tak- ing post on Nuke Hill and the point opposite the South end of Boston -It was absolutely necessary that they should be previously fortified in order to cover and command them -As soon as the Works on the former are finished and compleat, measures will be immediately adopted for Securing the latter and making them as strong and de[f]ensible as we can -their contiguity to the Enemy will make them of much Importance and of great service to us. As Mortars are essential and Indispensably necessary for carrying on our operations &amp; for the prosecution of our plans, I have applied to Two Fur- naces to have some thirteen Inch ones cast with all expedition Immaginable, </P>

<P>AMEKICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>and am encouraged to hope from the Accounts I have had, that they will be able to do It -When they are done and a proper supply of powder Ob- tained, I flatter myself, from the posts we have just taken &amp; are about to take, that It will be in our power to force the Ministerial Troops to an at- tack, or to dispose of 'em in some way that will be of advantage to us-I think from these posts they will be so galled and annoyed, that they must ei- ther give us Battle, or quit their present possessions. I am resolved that noth- ing on my part shall be wanting to effect the one or the other. </P>

<P>It having been the General opinion that the Enemy wou'd attempt to dislodge our people from the Hills and force their works as soon as they were discovered, which probably might have brought on a general Engage- ment, It was thought advisable that the Honble Council shou'd be applied to, to order in the Militia from the Neighbouring &amp; adjacent Towns -I wrote them on the Subject, which they most readily complied with; and in Justice to the Militia, I cannot but Inform you, that they came in at the ap- pointed Time, and manifested the greatest alertness and determined resolu- tion, to have acted like men engaged in the cause of Freedom. </P>

<P>When the Enemy first discovered our Works in the morning, they seemed to be in great confusion, and from their movements to have Intended an Attack. -It is much to be wished, that it had been made -The event I think, must have been fortunate, and nothing less than success and victory on our side, as our officers and men appeared Impatient for the appeal, and to have possessed the most animated sentiments and determined resolution -</P>

<P>On Tuesday Evening, a Considerable number of their Troops em-barked on board of their Transports and fell down to the Castle, where part of 'em landed before dark; One or two of the Vessells got aground and were fired at by our people with a Field piece but without any damage -What was the design of this embarkation and landing I have not been able to learn; It would seem as If they meant an Attack; for It is most probable that If they make one on our Works at Dorchester at this time, that they will first go to the Castle and come from thence -If such was their design, a violent Storm that night and which lasted till Eight O'clock the next day, rendered the execution of It impracticable -It carried one or two of their Vessells ashore, which have since got off -</P>

<P>in Case the Ministerial Troops had made an Attempt to dislodge our Men from Dorchester Hills, and the Number detached upon the occasion, had been so great as to have afforded a probability of a successful attack's being made upon Boston, on a Signal given from Roxbury for that purpose, agreable to a Settled and concerted plan, Four thousand chosen men who were held in readiness were to have embarked at the Mouth of Cambridge River in Two divisions -The first under the Command of Brigadier Gen- eral [John] Sullivan -The Second under Brigadier General [Nathanael] Greene, the whole to have been commanded by Major General [Israel] Putnam -The First division was to land at the powder House &amp; gain posses- sion of Beacon Hill &amp; Mount Whoredom-The Second at Barton's point, or a little South of It, and after securing that post, to join the other division </P>

<P>MARCH. 1776 </P>

<P>and Force the Enemies Gates and Works at the Neck for letting in the Rox- bury Troops -Three floating Batteries were to have preceded and gone in Front of the other Boats, and kept up a heavy Fire on that part of the Town, where our men were to Land -How far our views would have suc- ceeded had an opportunity offered for attempting the execution, is impossible for me to say-Nothing less than an experiment cou'd determine with precision- The plan was thought to be well digested, and as far as I cou'd judge, from the cheerfulness and alacrity. which distinguished the Officers &amp; men who were to engage in the Enterprize, I had reason to hope for a favourable &amp; happy Issue. </P>

<P>[Extract] Plymouth, March 7,1776 I am in a poor situation to give you intelligence. I have but a very im- perfect account of the military operations. The bombardment and canno- nade of Boston begun on Saturday last, [March 21, and our army took possession of Dorchester Hill on Monday or Tuesday night, without any dif- ficulty, and have strongly entrenched. What is to be next I know not. I presume you will have every particular from Head quarters. Whether Howe has a design to evacuate Boston or not is to me very uncertain, but some circumstances look like it. Where he will go if he does, is equally uncertain. Can Administration, with all their stupidity, view with indiffer- ence the French force in the West Indies, or is not that true? If true, it must be important to them or us. No prizes lately taken. A ship of 300 tons from Boston to New York, mounted with the carriage guns, thirty men, some coal, 7000 cannon ball, and a few other articles, lately run on shore on the back of the Cape, the ship bilged, and everything on board taken posses- sion of and secured by our pe~ple.~ I can give you no particular account of the three regiments for Canada from those governments, but I dare say they are gone. Every thing was favourable when I last heard. I want to hear from your fleet, their destination, success, etc. I want to hear the character, the business etc. of the Baron de Woedke, Knight of Malta, who passed through this town in his way to Congress, with letters to Dr. Franklin, etc.. . . </P>

<P>My Dear Sir Plymo March 7th 1776 I am greatly Obliged to you for your favour of the 6th of Feby which found me at Home sick &amp; Confined, but had the Intended Effect it really made my Heart Glad. the want of powder you &amp; I have often bitterly Lamented and if the pleasure of having it, is to be in proportion to the pain we have felt for the want of it, we may have a right to rejoice on its Arrival. I wish I could in return give you An Acco of the Arrival of the Brigt from Bilboa, but I hear nothing of her lately, I am in a poor situa- tion to give you Intelligence from our Colony I left Watertown before the Court rose sick, &amp; have been Confined to my House ever since I got home. . . when are we to Expect measures more Capital. is this Spring &amp; Summer, &amp; the precious Moments thereof to be spent in treating and Negotiateing with the Agents of the British Admn from whence we can derive Nothing but [il- legible] disunion poverty &amp; oppression, or shall it be spent in Treating with foreign Embassadors, settleing an Entensive 24 Lucrative Commerce from which we may derive Union, Security, Riches, &amp; Freedom. your Principles, &amp; Love for your Country will lead you to regret the time spent in the first &amp; to wish to be Employed in the last. you have to Encounter all the Subtlety &amp; arts high and low of the 39 Commissioners, &amp; at the same time the Modera- tion, the Timidity, the Interests and prejudices of many among us. if the Union of the Colonies is not Injured by this measure of Admn I think we shall have little to fear from them in future.

<P>[New York] Die Jovis, 10 HO. A.M. March 7th, 1776. Mr. [Jacobus] Van Zandt, seconded by Mr. [Comfort] Sands, moved in the words following, to wit: </P>

<P>I move that a letter be wrote tb the Continental Congress giv- ing them a true copy of [the state of] this city and Colony, occa- sioned by the stoppage of plovisions to the ships of war by order ot General Lee. The same being considered and unanimously agreed to, Ordered, That Mr. [Thomas] Smith, Mr Van Zandt and Mr. [Leonard] </P>

<P>Gansevort, be a committee to prepare and report a draft of such letter, with all convenient speed. </P>

<P>Mr.Jacobus Van Zandt informed the Congress that the money he has al- ready received towards lading the ship Rosamond, on Provincial account, is insufficient for the purpose, and that he wants the sum of £ 167 19s. to com- plete the lading of the said ship. </P>

<P>Ordered, That Peter Van Brugh Livingston, Esqr. as Treasurer of this Congress, advance to Mr. Jacobus Van Zandt the sum of one hundred and sixty-seven pounds nineteen shillings to complete the lading of the ship Ro-sarnond, Wright Southgate, master; and that the said Treasurer takes Mr. Van Zandt's receipt for the same. </P>

<P>A letter from Major-General Lee was read and filed, and is in the words following, to wit: </P>

<P>New-York, March 6th, 1776. Sir-I have just received an uncertified paper, the purport of which seems to imply that the men of war and Governor Tryon are </P>

<P>. to be supplied as formerly with provisions. Subsequently to this .</P>

<P>order of the Provincial Congress, the Continental Congress have in- structed me to put the city in the best state of defence possible. I am so unfortunate as not to be able to discover how furnishing the enemy with the necessaries of life can contribute to this end; it certainly must open the means of their receiving every sort of intel- </P>

<P>MARCH 1776 * 215 </P>

<P>ligence which ought to be withheld from them, for I cannot myself 
conceive, that the oath of the port master should bind his boat's 
crew. It is true they are to be restrained from going on board, but 
. I defy human cunning to prevent, (when they are once alongside,) 
the conveyance of a letter. I must entreat, sir, that the Congress 
will not suppose that I am aiming at an authority superior to theirs 
in thus giving my opinion, and raising objections to any thing they 
have resolved. I respect them as the true representatives of the 
people and proper Legislature of the Province; but, sir, the infor- 
mation I have received from Cambridge, and the orders I have re- 
ceived from the Continental Congress, will justify me in most 
</P>

<P>humbly entreating the Congress not to enjoin me to assent, (so much against my conscience,) to any intercourse of anj;'hind with Mr. Tryon, who must be considered as a most dangerous enemy. </P>

<P>There is one thing further I would submit to the wisdom of the Congress, whether it will be prudent to suffer a single man (in our present circ~unstances) to remain in the city, who will not en- ter into an engagement to take up arms in defence of the common rights. I took the liberty to address a letter to you hinting a meas- ure somewhat related to this scheme, but was not honoured with an answer. I am, sir [kc.] </P>

<P>Charles Lee. , P.S. . . .I must now inform you, sir, that in consequence of the last instructions from the Continental Congress, to put this city and its environs in a state of defence, I have ordered Colonel [Andrew] Ward, as a previous measure, to secure the whole body of professed tories in Long island. When the enemy is at our door, forms must be dispensed with; my duty to you, to the Continental Congress, and to my own conscience, have dictated the necessity of the measure. If 1 have done wrong, and I confess the irregularity, I must submit myself to the shame of being repilted foolish, rash and precipitate. I must undergo the censure of the public, but I shall have consciousness in my own breast that the most pure motives of . serving the public cause, uncontaminated by pique or resentment to individuals, have urged me to the step. There is now a ruffian under guard, one John Greg, who attempted to murder the senti- nels on their posts the other night. I beg to know your pleasure on the subject. As to the affair of the sentries firing on the boats, I never heard till this moment that they had repeated a misdemeanor so contrary to the orders they had received. I can only say that I am very sorry that my or- ders have been so little respected, and that if I can find out the cul- prits they shall be severely punished. I am, sir [kc.] Charles Lee.

<P>[Extract] Philad. March 7. 1776 My dear General . I have now the'pleasure of informing you that a Vessel long expected from France Pc ~olland arrived a few Days ago with 25 Tons of Powder-300 Stand of excellent Arms &amp; 1500 Weight of salt Petre. -We are hourly in Expectation of further Arrivals, but we must now soon expect some Ships of War in our River which I fear will cut off all further Enter- prizes of the like Nature. We have Accounts from Virginia that Clinton was arrived at Hampton but seemed to be waiting for his Reinforcements- Nothing farther new therefore from that Quarter -We have not heard a Syllable from our Fleet for a considerable Time but expect Intelligence every Hour -Upon the Arrival of the Act of Parliament authorizing the Ships of War to seize all American Vessels &amp; condemn tham as lawful Prize, Application was made to Congress by several Persons for Letters of Marque &amp; Reprizal but they could not feel bold enough -tho many of the most timid &amp; those who have hanker[e]d so much after Reconciliation seeing so little of a Spirit of that Kind in Great Brittain have come off very much from those Senti- ments the Result of old prejudices &amp; new Fears. </P>

<P>Gentlemen Port Tobacco March 7th 1776. Captain Conway arrived opposite the mouth of Port Tobacco Creek about 2 oclock this morning &amp; it being calm &amp; an ebb tide he came here for orders about eight oClock -I sent him on board again immediately to pro- ceed up the eastern branch of this river till his vessel was fast on ground &amp; then to deliver the powder to the Committee of Bladensburgh if I am not there without loss of time. The letter from Mr [Richard] Harrison would have sent by express instantly, but Colo Ware informs me he is pushing for Annapolis &amp; I concluded it would be as soon at hand by him -Mr Harrison writes me that Mr Wicoff of Martinicoe has consigned some medicine to Jen- ifer &amp; Hooe for sale, I have not recd any directions from him about them, nor even an invoice, it seems his brothers at Philadelphia are to furnish directions about them, &amp; if I find there are such as the province will want, shall delay the sale till I advise you thereof. I imagine Conway will be at Bladensburgh by this evening &amp; some time tomorrow I shall be there to re- ceive your orders respecting the further destination of the vessel &amp; the dis- </P>

<P>WILLIAM EWEN 'TO CAPTAIN ANDREW BARKLEY, R.N., AND MAJOR 
JAMES GRANT 
</P>

<P>[No. 31 Savannah, in the Council of Safety, March 7, 1776. Gentlemen: We have been privy to several letters which have passed </P>

<P>to and from Colonel McIntosh, Messrs. Demerb and Roberts, and your- </P>

<P>selves; and we find by yours that you consider that we consented the </P>

<P>merchant shipping should go down to Cockspur, with the troops; whereas </P>

<P>the most cursory review of the letter which appertains to that matter, will at </P>

<P>AMERICAN THEATRE </P>

<P>once evidently show you, that tlie troops and armed vessels only were meant; and we now declare to you, that none others were intended. Indeed, a mo- ment's reflection will further demonstrate this; for you and all Great Britain know, that we have'rnade, and are yet pursuing, a commercial opposition to the acts so much complained of, and which have roused this large Continent into arms. </P>

<P>We abhor the idea of infidelity, and have, therefore, forborne to avail ourselves of the advantages which your situation, for several days past, put in our power, until we should have an opportunity of having the misapprehen- sion explained. We will now forbear any virulent expressions, but we deem the detention of Messrs. DemerC and Roberts a breach of that good faith which the parent country has been so much famed for keeping invio- late. </P>

<P>We knew the troops were on board tlie nierchant shipping some hours before they went, and, relying on the conimon faith of the civilized part of the world, expected that you would have permitted them to return, and have made what might pass between you and them the groundwork of an ex- planation; and by that means have prevented any hostilities. </P>

<P>In one of Colonel McIntosh's letters to Messrs. DemerC and Roberts, he authorized them, in case you should withdraw to Cockspur, as before we have explained, then to receive any propositions you might make; but this never can be construed into an assent on our part to your detaining them. </P>

<P>The merchant shipping, also, we consider as appertaining to this Prov- ince, and, of course, under our cognizance; and the attempt to take them away by force justified the opposition. The capture, also, of the vessel with goods, we conceive, cannot be justified upon any principle whatever. </P>

<P>From these premises, gentlemen, you will readily conclude that we ex- pect two things: the one is, the return of our citizens, and the other the withdrawing your troops from on board the merchant shipping, and car- rying them and the armed vessels down'only to Cockspur. </P>

<P>That you may not be deceived, we now make this declaration: We ex- pect a return of our citizens to the place from whence they were taken, by twelve o'clock to-morrow, with your assurance, upon honour, to with- draw without any attempt to land in either Province, as soon as wind and tide shall permit; and in case you shall refuse or neglect compliance, we shall consider either as a breach of the cessation you desired. And we de- clare further, that your treatment of our three citizens, now in your power, will be our criterion of conduct towards all those men who now are, oy may be in our power. </P>

<P>The laws of retaliation have suggested to us the propriety and expedien- cy of arresting and confining the King's officers; several of whom we have ac- cordingly taken and confined; but these men, upon the return of our friends, and not before, shall be enlarged. </P>

<P>Dear Sir . -Head Qrs 8th March 1776. -Monday Night [March 41 Two Thousand men under the Command of Brigadier General [John] Thomas took Possession of Dorchester Heights; a vast Quantity of Materials being previously Collected, especially, Chandi- liers, &amp; Fascines, our Troops were soon coverd, &amp; long before day, began to Break Ground to thicken their defences against The Enemys Cannon: -To Conceal our design, &amp; divert the Enemys Attention, a very Heavy Service of Cannon', Pe Mortars, began to Play upon the Town between ten, and Eleven, Saturday night; from our Three Fortified Batteries at Cobble Hill, Letch- meres Point, and Lambs Dam; this was continued all that night, and the two Succeeding; The Enemy return'd The Fire constantly, but allways ceased as we did in the Mornings. Our Shot must have made Great Havock amongst the Houses; as I am confident they Swept the Town, what Loss, oth- erwise suffer'd by the Enemy, we are Ignorant; as neither Townsman, nor Deserter, has yet come in to acquaint us! Monday morning at Sun rise, ex- pecting The Enemy would attempt to Force 'our New Works upon the Heights, everything was prepared for their proper Reception; and a large Body of Troops were drawn up near Cambridge River, with Orders upon a Signal Given, to Embark on board the Flat Bottom'd Boats, and in Two Di- visions push into Boston; but the Enemy disappointed us by remaining Sul- len &amp; Sulkey in Boston. ~~ffering</P>

<P>Our Works upon the Heights to be carried on without any other molestation, than now, &amp; Then, a Feint Canno- nade upon Dorchester Neck; &amp; even this, ceased with the day; for neither side have since Fired a Shott at each other! by monday morning our Re- doubts will be Finish'd, &amp; Baracks for 600 Men; so all that Peninsula; may now be called Ours, as the Cannon on the Heights Commands the whole of it; The behaviour of The Enemy since Monday strongly indicates their in- tention of removing from Boston; as their Heavy Cannon, Powder, &amp;c has been seen, &amp; heard, Transporting from Bunkers Hill, and the.upper parts of The Town, to the Wharfs next the Shiping, for several days past; &amp; this morning a Quantity of Beding is Observed putting on board Transports at the Long Warf: -.before we are quite ready to advance our Batteries upon Dorches[te]r.point, I suspect the Enemy will Embarque. a few days will shew if am, or am not mistaken; I was disappointed in not receiving yo[url High Mightyness's Act of Independency by the Last Post. </P>

<P>Sir. Chatham Boston 8th March 1776 -Herewith I transmit to you Copies of Two Letters I received since my last of the 26th past from Captain Parker at New York, and Captain Wallace at Rhode Island, with their Intelligence and information of the State of these Colonies; And I am now to inform you, Sir, that on the Morning of the 4th instant we observed that the Rebels had the preceding night taken post on the heights of Dorchester, and had thrown up so extensive and strong a Redoubt that it was supposed not less than Ten or Twelve thou- sand Men could have been ernployed in perfecting it in so short a time; This was so alarming and I presume unexpected an Event from the Advan- tageous situation of this Post, commanding the Town and Harbour of Bos- ton, that General Howe Ordered an Attack to be made upon it that night, and Two thousand Troops were Embarked and in readiness for that Service, but the Wind blowing too fresh for the Boats to Row ahead the Expedition was laid aside, and the next day the 5th Orders were issued for the Army to prepare to embark with all the dispatch possible, which the very distress'd Condition it is in for want of Provision makes absolutely necessary, for 'till I gave Orders a few days ago for a Months Supply out of the Naval Stores, it had not then more than a sufficiency for Fourteen days, and except a Supply arrives very speedily for both Services, the Consequence must be fatal. We are now using our utmost efforts and attention in Embarking the Ordance and other Stores, and preparing for Evacuating this Town and Harbour to proceed to Halifax, the nearest and most likely place of refuge for an Army under such necessitous and Singular Circumstances, where I shall Convoy it with 'part of His Majesty's Squadron under my Command, leaving all the Force I can spare for the protection of the Supplies intended for this place. On the representation of General Howe of the small importance the Ships under Captain Wallace's Command are now at ~hode Island, and the very few I have to protect our Supplies from falling into the hands of the Rebels, especially on our leaving Boston, I have Ordered Captain Wallace to send two of them (the Swan and Bolton Armed Brig) to Cruize in the track of any Vessels bound here, and to see them in safety in their way to Halifax, The Glasgow I have Ordered to New York and from thence to the South- ward with General Howe's and my Dispatches, and the Rose I have Ordered to Halifax to clean and refit. I likewise herewith transmit to You Copy of a Letter from Captain [George] Talbot of the Niger, informing me of the loss of the Friendship </P>

<P>Captain Parker having acquainted me of the Death of Mr George Cle- phan Purser of the Asia on the 24th January last, I have Appointed Mr Edward Bragge my Secretary to Succeed him in that Employment, which I hope their Lordships will be pleased to confirm him in. . I am Sir [kc.] </P>

<P>In order to prevent any obstructions to the supply of provision and other necessaries being furnished to the ships of war and the Governor's ship, pursuant to a former order of this Congress, it is ' </P>

<P>Resolved and Ordered, That whenever provisions or supplies are to be furnished to either of the said ships, the port master ap- </P>

<P>That this supply is to take place and be continued on condi- tion that there be no obstruction given to any boats or vessels bringing provisions, provender or firewood, to this city. </P>

<P>The Congress agreed with their committee in this part of their report and confirms the same. </P>

<P>The said committee farther reported that as to the firing of the senti- nels on the boats coming to and departing from this city, they had, in cdn- junction with Lord Stirling, settled and agreed on such orders with him, to be issued to the troops by Lord Stirling, as will prevent that inconvenience for the future; and that Lord Stirling will, towards evening, transmit to this Congress a copy of such orders, and requested a copy of the regulations for supplying provisions to the ships by them above reported, if the same should be agreed to and confirmed by this Congress. </P>

<P>. Capt. Rutgers and Mr. Randal informed the Congress that from various infomations which ,they have obtained, (the particulars whereof they men- tioned,) they have good reason to believe that the report of a number of top- sail vessels being at Sandy Hook, is false. But they have notwithstanding despatched Capt. McIlroy to the Narrows to make discovery, and that this Congress may expect his information this evening. </P>

<P>Christopher Duyckinck, who was sent to apprehend some pilots late of this city, and now in the service of the ministerial navy, being at the door was admitted. He says those pilots came on shore, but with a boat with armed men for their protection; that they came on shore frequently in that manner; that they had been three times on shore, since he went to endeavor to apprehend them; that without the assistance of 25 or 30 men, with mus- kets, he thinks it is not probable they will be apprehended; that he thinks that number, with three or four days' provision and properly armed and lodged, may effect the taking of them; that a brigantine, having on board rum, sugar and salt, was taken yesterday evening; that Francis James, the pi- lot, went out in the vessel that seized and took her, and was active therein; that the Phoenix has a number of boats about her. </P>

<P>Ordered, That Colo. [Alexander] McDougall give such directions as he may think necessary, for apprehending the said pilots, and that that matter be committed solely to him, and Duyckinck take his directions. </P>

</P>

<P>Capt. McIlroy, who was sent out at noon by Capt. Rutgers and Capt. Randall, returned. He was brought near the chair. He says that there is not any topsail vessel below, but a brigantine which belongs to one Barnes of Elizabeth Town and which is seized by the Phoenix; that four sloop rigged vessels (one of them very small) lie near the Phoenix; that a person informed him-that he had seen five sail off of the Hook, that two of them were brigantines. </P>

<P>LORDSTIRLING MATTHIAS LONGISLAND</P>

<P>TO COLONEL WARD, </P>

<P>Dear Sir: Head-Quarters, New-York, March 8, 1776. I write this letter to you in the utrnost confidence of secrecy, and there- fore no man but yourself is to see it. It is absolutely necessary to prevent the present communications between the ship Phenix, which lays off the west end of Long-Island, below the Narrows, and the people of that part of Long Island; but more especially to take or destroy a certain Frank James, a pilot, who now assists Captain Parker, commander of the Phenix, in decoy- ing and taking vessels of great importance to the cause we are engaged in. There are some other pilots serving him in the same way, whose names I am not informed of, but are well known to the bearer, Mr. Christopher Duyckinck, who, with three or four other guides, will attend you for the pur- pose hereinafter mentioned. I must desire you will pick out of your regiment two of the most alert officers, and two parties of about twenty men each, to be supplied with twenty rounds of ammunition, and three days' provision, and order them to proceed with the guides, to the place they will show them, to conceal themselves as much as possible from the people of the country, and to take such stations as are most proper for effecting the purposes above- mentioned; and to take and secure or destroy those pilots, or any persons belonging to the man-of-war. It will be best that the two parties march from your quarters to-morrow evening, a little before moon-rising, so that they may arrive at their station before daylight; and it will be absolutely necessary that the officers of each party consult with, and put the utmost con- fidence in, the guides assigned to them. When the parties have taken their stations, they, if possible, should prevent any boats from leaving without firing, or by any means alarming the man-of-war or the country; and the shortest way of effecting this will be, for single men about daylight to ex- amine the shore, and with ther hatchets to cut a hole or two in the bottom of all the small boats they find there, and to remove to some secret place the oars, paddles, or sails. You will see the necessity of this matter being con- </P>

<P>By General Washington's last letter to Congress dated 26th Febry he seems to be ot opinion that Howe is preparing to evacuate Boston &amp; to shift the scene of war: they have removed two mortars from Bunkers hill &amp; have shipped several pieces of ordnance &amp; baking large quantities of biscuit &amp; getting ready tlie transports &amp; men of war, as if a voyage wau intended -Washington writes he shall dispatch tlie light troops as soon as the enemy quits Boston &amp; will follow hirnself with the rest of the army to N. York where he conjectures they'will attempt to land % take possession of that city. I do not think they will entirely abandon Boston: they will probably keep in it a garrison sufficient for its protection, &amp; with the rest of the troops endeavour to gain N. York &amp; wait there the arrival of more forces from Eu- rope. . . I suspect, as Clinton is arrived in Virga, a vessel of war will be sent to Baltimore or to Annapolis -. . . </P>

Mr Eddis is this moment returned from the Otter sloop of War and brought a letter from Capt Squire to the Governor, a copy of it I send you. As I expected So it has turned out that the man of war was detained three or four hours and in all probability will not be before Baltimore Town 'till seven or eight oclock in the morning. I therefore send you this express to apprize you and the Committee of Balt Town that the Otter has 18 guns, one of the Tenders six guns and 4 swivels and the other armed with swivels only. The Capt is to send a flag in to demand the ship Defence. wish with all my heart our stores were out and the ship at the bottom of the </P>

<P>sea. Eddis left the man of war at 4 oclock, about which time Hudson's ship was taken. The Committee of Balt Town being apprized of these particu- lars will take their measures accordingly. Squire behaved politely to Mid- dleton when in distress and was he to come ere in peaceable times 1 should be glad to shew him the Civility due to a gentleman but I think he will have better luck than I expect he will meet with if he purchases much provision in Annapolis. The Vessel burnt off the Mouth of Severn Squire says was done without order and done by an inconsiderate midshipman. She was worth but little and had only two barrels of Flour in hb I believe. </P>

<P>Sir. We inclose you an order for Capt [George] Stricker's Company to march down to Baltimore Town instead of coming to Annapolis if you think it necessary. When the man of war leaves Balt Town and Comes down this way you will be pleased to order them to Annapolis. Nothing new has happened since writing you last night. Stricker has already been ordered here your express may be directed to meet him. </P>

<P>Sir, I did myself the Honor to write to your Excely the 16th ulto which for want of Conveyance lyes here Still,.as our Continental Post is not well regu- lated this Length yet. -It is hardly worth troubling you with any Report of our Battalion, as 1 have heard from very few of our Recruiting Officers, -8c we have only between 20. &amp; 30 Men Lf them in Town. -but the Transac- tions here since that Time may deserve some Notice. -The Men of Warr at Tybee, tho' still giving out they had no Hostile Intentions against this Col- ony, were encouraging our slaves to Desert to them, Pilfering our Sea Islands for Provision, &amp; our Governor broke his Parole of Honor &amp; went pri- vately in the Night with his Family aboard the Scarborough Capt. [Andrew] </P>

<P>Barkley, which gave us every reason to expect they Meant to Land at or near the Town, destroy it, &amp; carry off about twenty Sail of shiping Lying in the River, -having among other Articles near 3000. Tierces of Rice on board. -between 3 &amp;400 of our Militia &amp; 100 from So Carolina were all that could be got to defend an open, Straggling, defenseless &amp; deserted Town, with Numberless Avenues Leading to it, and those Men under no Controul or Command whatsoever. and to add to the Anxiety &amp; Confusion we were </P>

<P>. in, our Council of Safety had not Met for some time having differed about the Meaning of a Resolve of the Continental Congress respecting the Ships Sailing the 1st of March. In this desperate State of Affairs I Ventured to take the Command of the Militia least the Colony.should be tamely given up, tho', I must acknowl- ege with some reluctance -and after examining very paticularly as 1 was unacquainted around the Town, I placed Gaurds every where the Enemy could Land, &amp;Am[b]ushes in the different Roads Leading to it which made the Duty very Severe &amp; reduced our Number in Town greatly. -In the mean time the Cherokee, the two Transports, the Armed Vessels &amp; Boats came up the River within 2% Miles of Town, near where we Sunk a Hulk in the Channel of the River, &amp; opposite to Brewton's Plantation where I placed a Detachment of 150 Men under the Command of Col. [Archibald] Bullock, expecting they woud attempt to Land there. -The Enemy were parading with their Boats for Several Days within Gunshot of our Centinels, who tho' they were ordered not to fire unless they were fired upon first, or they attempted to Lan[d,] gave them Several shot, but were not returned. -Our Council of Safety were got together &amp;resolved th[e] Shiping should not Sail, &amp; ordered they should be unrigged. -The Evening of the 2d of March One of the Transport ships, the Schooner Hinchinbrook 8c Sloop St. John of 8. or 10. Guns each, with some B[oats,] Sailed in our Sight, up the North River, back of Hutchinson's Island Lying opposite to the Town of Sa- vannah, but so far off that a Little Battery we had below the Town which played upon them coud do no damage to them. -expecting the Enemy in- tended coming round Hutchinson's Island, &amp; down the south side of [it] to make their Landing good at Yamacraw (a Village 3, or 400, [yards] above the Town) I had 3. four pounders carryed there, a Little Battery errected in haste, &amp; threw up Intrenchments. -&amp; withdrew part of the Guard at Brewtons, without Weakening it too m[uch,] or withdrawing any of our Am- bushes on that side, Least it might be a feint to deceive us. -About the Mid- dle of the same Night (as we were afterwards informed) The Commodore Barkley, &amp; Majors [James] Grant 8c [John] Maitland with about 300. Men as it was Said, Landed on the back of Hutchinson's Island with some Howitzers &amp; Field Pieces, and with the assistance &amp;contrivance of all our own Sea far- ing People &amp; many from the Town crossed the Island &amp; hid themselves aboard of our Merchant Ships, which were previously Halled close to the Is- land, a little above our Battery at Yamacraw for that Purpose. -early on Sunday the 3d the two Armed Vessels intending to Cover the Enemy's Land- ing had come round the Island, &amp; coming down on the South Side were at-</P>

<P>tacked by parties of Riflers ordered for that purpose, &amp; kept Smartly En- gaged on both Sides most of the Day, untill they lost the Tide &amp; got aground.-while two Sailors (Americans) at the risq[ue] of their ~ives Stole ashore &amp; informed me, the Enemy were hid on board our Mercht Men, &amp; had taken Jos: Rice prisoner, who was employed to unrig them that Morn- ing to confirm this inteligence, Messs [Raymond] Demert &amp; [Daniel] Roberts were ordered to go only along Side the Vessels, &amp; without Arms to demand our fellow Citizen Mr Rice, but to our astonishment they were also forced on board &amp; kept, which convinced us our information was true, &amp; immedi-ately our Little Battery of three Guns began to play upon them, which they returned and was continued very smartly with Ball, Langrage &amp; Small Arms from both Sides for Several Hours.- Our Men were inflamed, particularly at our own People who had treacherously Joined the Enemy against us, &amp; were eager to board them, but we had neither Boats, Sailors or Arms proper for the Attempt, &amp; the Oars of the few Boats we had were previously stole away. -The general cry then was, to Sett all the shiping on fire, in attempt- ing of which many of our People shewed great Resolution &amp; Bravery, but unfortunately the first ship Set afire (Valued at £20,000 Sterg) was so Large that she grounded before she got up to the others. -afterwards a Sloop was fired, which burnt two others, while the rest were cutting away, amidst the shot of our Riflers &amp; Langrage &amp; sliping higher up the River, &amp; out of our Reach with the last of the flood in the Mean time many of the Soldiers hastily Landed on the Island in great confusion, running in the Marsh in a Laughable Manner, for fear of our Riflers tho' far past their reach, untill they got aboard of a Tire [tier] of ships highel: up the River, &amp; out of the Reach of our Guns, near the Armed Vessels. -in this manner Ten Sail of our Vessels went along with the Enemy round the upper End of the Island, a Channel never known-before, with Sixteen [illegible] hundred bar- rels of Rice, with the Utmost anxiety &amp; fear. -after being foiled in their scheme upon the Town, the Commodore &amp; Majors eagerly &amp; repeatedly So- licited a Cessation of Hosilitys, for which they [promlised immediately to repair to Tybee &amp; not molest us again, which was at Length Granted them with seeming dificulty, tho' the'truth was, we had [no] Means of annoying them .by Water. -the rest of [the] shipping we halled close to' the Wharfs, -confined [some] of their Captains for acting against us, with our [Chief] Justice &amp; Some Councilors, untill they released .[our] fellow Citizens, Demert, Roberts, &amp; Rice, &amp; Sent [them] up from Tybee, where our Enemys are all now [gone.-] whether, they intend to try us again or not, I am [not] able ,to inform your Excely. -in this, I think they rather lost, than gained any reputation, and have done us great Honour, by being the Second Prov- ince on the Continent which they attacked, and were Shamefully Foiled. -we had in all our different Engagements but two white Men &amp; one Indian wounded slightly. -they must have many, both killed &amp; Wounded, tho' they ackn[owledge] but Six. -Several were seen to fall. -I have the Honour to be your Excely's [kc.] </P>

<P>from place to place, for the Good of the Service and Safety of the Prov- ince, and had no communication with the Shore only with the Governor and council -As things were thus circumstanced when I left Providence, I think it my duty to give you the earliest intelligence of that Event. I have also by the pacquet which is now getting under Sail, Wrote the commanding Officer at Georgia and South Carolina, and acquainted them with every cir- cumstance I could learn or recollect According to the best of my Judgement: And I am positive the whole Rebel Fleet and Armament will fall a sacrifice if attacked I cannot be more explicit on the subject as the Vessel is under sail -I have got some of the Powder on board and am going over the Barr of Saint Augustine We are also in some distress having come away uncom- pleated in the Schooners Repairs, Stores, Provisions &amp;ca which we were ob- liged to Leave behind -I have the honor to be with respect &amp;ca </P>

<P>PATRICK TO CAPTAIN BARKLEY, Sir This moment I, have received the inclosed, from Lieutenant Grant of His Majesty's Schooner St John. -</P>

<P>Are you Sir, confined by the Service you are now employed on, so as to prevent, your undertaking proper measures to destroy this rebel Squadron? or does, the orders you are under, permit you to take such a step? -</P>

<P>I am sorry Lieut Grant has not been particular, as to the force of each of the Rebel Ships. </P>

<P>He shall be brought into this Harbour as soon as possible, the Pilot is on board of him, &amp;a launch going to him. -</P>

<P>When the Gunpowder is taken out of the St John Schooner, he shall be prepared with all dispatch, to fall down close to the Bar, ready to push over It. -</P>

<P>I mention this, in case you shou'd undertake to go after this Squadron, which by Grant, may be expected on this Coast, that, he may be ready to go out and Join your Ships, If you shou'd think proper to pass along within view of this Port, and by makeing a Signal, he shall go out to you. -</P>

<P>I have this Instant finished my dispatches to go by the Packet, that ar- rived the day before yesterday from England, she will sail directly for Savan- nah River, I have desired him to make all possible haste to you. -</P>

<P>It may be necessary also, that you pass this way, in order, to know, if we have been able to procure further intelligence of these Rebels, as they may avoid you by sliping into some of our Rivers, &amp; Lt Grant may be able, to be more particular in his information. -</P>

<P>I apprehend these rebel Vessels, may Le come from South Carolina. -MARCH 1.776 251 </P>

<P>. I hope the Vessels I sent to you are got safe, and that they have been of use. -I am, with great truth, Sir, [&amp;c.] Patk Tonyna3 St Augustine 8th March 1776. 3.o'Clock in the morning. -</P>

You will please to communicate this to the provincial Congress or Convention, Who the General doubts not, will coopperate with You in using every endeavour to prevent their forming a lodgment, before his Excellency can come or send to Youi Assistance -the fate of America depends upon this Campaign, &amp; the </P>

<P>[Extract] [Cambridge] March 9 Yesterday evening a Captain Irvine who escaped from Boston the night before with Six of his Crew, came to Head Quarters and gave the following Intelligence -&quot;That our Bombardment and Cannonade caused a good deal of Surprize and alarm in Town, as many of the Soldiery said they never heard or thought we had Mortars or Shells: -That several of the officers ac- knowledged they were well and properly directed -That they made much distress and confusion -That the Cannon Shot for the greatest part went thro' the Houses, and he was told, that one took of[f] the Legs and Arms of Six men lying in the Barracks on the Neck -That a Soldier who came from the Lines there on Tuesday morning Informed him that 20 men had been wounded the night before -It was reported that Others were also hurt, and one of the light Horse torn to pieces by the explosion of a Shell -This was afterwards contradicted: -That early on Tuesday morning Adml Shuldham discovering the works our people were throwing up on Dorchester Heights, immediately sent an Express to General Howe to inform him, and that It was necessary they should be attacked and dislodged from thence, or he wou'd be under the necessity of withdrawing the Ships from the Harbour, which were under his command: -That preparations were directly made for that purpose as It was said, and from Twelve to Two oClock about 3,000 men embarked on board the Transports which fell down to the Castle with a design of Landing on that part of Dorchester next to It, and Attacking the works on the Heights at 5 oClock next morning: That Lord [Hugh] Percy was appointed to command -That It was generally beleivd the attempt would have been made, had It not been for the violent Storm which hap- pened that night as I have mentioned before -That he heard several of the Privates and one or two Serjeants say as they were embarking, that It woud be another Bunker Hill affair -He further Informs that the Army is prepar- ing to leave Boston and that they will do It in a day or two-That the Transports necessary for their embarkation were getting ready with the ut- most expedition -That there had been great movements &amp; confusion among the Troops the night &amp; day prkcedg his coming out, in hurrying down their Cannqn, Artillery &amp; other Stores to the wharffs with the utmost precipita- tion, and were putting em on board the Ships in such haste that no Account or Memorandum was taken of them -That most of the Cannon were re- moved from their Works and embarked &amp; embarkg -That he heard a wom- an say which he took to be an Officers wife, that she had seen men go under </P>

<P>the ground at the lines on the neck without returning- That the Ship he commanded was taken up, places fitted &amp; fitting for Officers to lodge, and Several Shot, Shells &amp; Cannon already on board -That the Tories were to have the liberty of going where they please, If they can get Seamen to man the Vessells, of which there was a great scarcity -That on that account many Vessells cou'd not be carried away and wou'd be burnt -That many of the Inhabitants apprehended the Town would be destroy'd, And that It was generally thought their destination is Hallifax -</P>

<P>The Account given by Captn Irvine as to the embarkation &amp; their being about to leave the Town I beleive true, there are other circumstances corroborating, &amp; It seems fully confirmed by a paper signed by four of the Select men of the Town, a Copy of which I have the honour to Inclose you, which was brought out yesterday evening by a Flag and delivered to Colo [Ebenezer] Learned by Major Bassett of the 10th Regiment who desired It might be delivered me as soon as possible. -I advised with such of the Gen- eral Officers upon the occasion as I cou'd be [sic] immediately Assemble, and we determined It right, as It was not addressed to me or any one else, nor authenticated by the signature of Genl Howe or any other act obliging him to a performance of the promise mentioned on his part, that I shou'd give it no Answer, at the same time that a Letter shou'd be returned as going from Colo Learned signifying his having laid It before me with the reasons as- signed for not answering It a copy of this is sent. </P>

<P>It being agreed on all hands, that there is no possibility of stopping them in case they determine to go, I shall order look outs to be kept upon all the Head Lands to discover their movements &amp; course, and moreover di- rect Commodore Manly and his little Squadron to dog them as well for the same purpose, as for picking up any of their Vessels that may chance to de- part their Convoy-From their loading with such precipitancy, It is presumable they'l not be in the best condition for Sea. </P>

<P>If the Ministerial Troops evacuate the Town and leave It standing, I have thoughts of taking measures for fortifying the Entrance into the Har- bour, If it shall be thought proper and the situation of affairs will admit of It. </P>

<P>Notwithstanding the report from Boston that Hallifax is the place of their destination, I have no doubt but that they are going to the Southward of this, and I apprehend to New York -many reasons lead to this opinion; It is in some measure' c&amp;roborated, by their sending an Express Ship there, which on Wednesday week got on shore &amp; Bilged at Cape Cod -the dis- patches if written, were destroy'd when she was boarded -she had a parcel of Coal and about 4,000 Cannon Shot, Six Carriage Guns, a swivel or two &amp; 3 Barrells of Powder: -?

<P>The Spaniards make it a practice to erect monuments to the memory of their illustrious heroes on the Ocean. This they do by calling their ships of war by their names. This custom not only does honor to illustrious virtue, but is calculated to inspire the Commanders and sailors on board their ships with courage. I suppose, in imitation of the practice of the Spaniards, the frigates now building for the Continental service are called by the names of Montgomery -Warren -illacpherson -Hendricks, &amp;c.? TVould not this be better than the many gasconading and ridiculous names which disgrace the </P>

<P>Baltimore 5 OClock Satd Morng [March 91 Dear Sir I am-obliged to you for Mr Jennifers Letter. I am so perfectly easey about the Ship of' War disturbing us that I shall not on that Score awaken Any body till morng- The Elk Ridge Battalion came in late this evening, I was raised at One OClock to Receive a Letter from Coll Lee which I sent off at that Hour by a Person who woud convey it directly to Capt [James] Nicholson -I let him know that the Committee had determd to fit out the Schr we talked of I hoped to have her ready to Sail by 2 OClock &amp; that our main design in it was to strengthen him with a fresh Reinforcemt of Hands shoud he be weakend by taking &amp; Manning any of the Tenders or Hudsons Ship -I thout it of much Importce that Nicholson shoud immedi- ately know of our Intention to strengthen him -I recommd to him to tow all Night in Order if possible to be up or nearly so with Hudsons Ship be- fore day light, lest the Tenders seeing him coming might have time to es- cape him. -I am perfectly satisfied from every thing I have heard of the Otter, that Nicl-*olson is very capable of taking her, if he can be so lucky as to catch the largest Sloop of which I think there is the greatest probability. -I have not a doubt we can have the Schr ready in the time I mentd &amp; to have her well Mand with brave Fellows.

<P>At a Meeting of the Committee 9 March 1776 -The following Letter was sent to Capt Nicholson -Sir -Baltimore 9 March 1776 -I a&amp; directed by the Committee of Baltimore to inform you, that, should the Tenders escape you, before you get down to Mr Hudson's Ship, and join the Otter, it is their Opinion, it would [be] improper for you to attack them all together, and that if you think there is a Probability of their coming to attack you, it would be most adviseable for you to return to Whetstone Point or Fells Point, to be ready to protect the Town, &amp; remain there, until you are properly enabled to attack the whole united Force -All the Vessels at Whetstone are getting Ballasted, &amp; will be ready for Sinking, when you see a Necessity for doing it -P Order of the Committee </P>

<P>S. Purviance Chn The Committee having recieved Information by Paul Miller that the Otter Sloop is aground on the Bodkin Shoals, &amp; that Capt Nicholson desired a Reinforcement of Men, Major Gist is directed to dispatch empty Vessels to lighten his Ship to be under the Direction of Capt Nicholson -A letter from Capt Nicholson was just reced informing them of retaking Mr Hudson's Ship, &amp; desiring Vessels to be sent to lighten her, but that being already done, which he could not know, when he wrote, the Committee thought it needless to send more -9 oClock P.M. An Express just arrived from North Point with Information, that the Otter &amp; her Tenders &amp; Prizes had left the Mouth of the River, and stood </P>

<P>down the Bay, on which William Adams was instantly dispatched with an Express to the Council of Safety, giving them the Information -</P>

<P>you. They were only that you should get the vessels ready for sinking and </P>

<P>not to sink them immediately. I would not have them sink 'till you are or- </P>

<P>Defence into the river this morning and she has retaken Mr [Jonathan] Hudsons ship and now lies in the river a little below her, under no great ap- prehension I fancy of the otter. We had intelligence this afternoon that [Matthew] Squires had run on ground on the Bodkin Point, I hope it may be true, if it should prove so we may perhaps add one more ship to our stock. We are getting a Tender ready but will mount 8 or 10 carriage guns 3 pounders she with the Defence will I think be a match for the otter and her Companions -I am Positive Nicholson &amp; his ships Company think so, a set of finer or more spirited fellows I really never saw, &amp; if we can, as I hope we shall, get the tender ready by to morrow morng they will push for an engagement &amp; I really am not in much doubt of success. I cannot con- ceive that the council of safety can be prejudiced in the opinions of the Gent of Baltimore by any insinuations against their conduct by Mr Ruben or any other person, I have not heard them say a single word against the Governmt sending Mr Eddis on board the otter (tho I confess I wish some other person had been pitched upon) on the Contrary I believe they think the delay occasioned by that step was advantageous to them, I am sure I </P>

<P>think it was very much so, I really had myself extremely fatigued with this Constant Hurry of Business, Indeed I am almost ready to sink under it, however I will push for Annapolis if possible the [moment] things are set- tled here. I am sincerely [kc.] Charles Carroll. </P>

We have there- fore appointed Colonel [Hugh] Mercer of the third &amp; Colonel [William] Peachey of the fifth regiment to examine the river &amp; fix the different posts &amp; mode of continuing these signals, but as we are aware that the course of the </P>

<P>Wilmington District, North-Carolina. Peter Simon, of Rhode-Island, maketh oath on the holy evangelists of Almighty God, that he was on board a vessel bound from Dominica to Ocra- cock, and taken off Hatteras by the sloop General Gage, George Stibbles master, and brought into Cape-Fear about the twenty-fifth of Feb-ruary. That Captain [John] Collett was on board the said sloop when this deponent was taken, and was very communicative with him, shewing his papers and instructions, and informing what route he was to take, &amp;c. That the said Collett said, he expected to find General Clinton here with fifteen or sixteen hundred men, and that the General was to be reinforced in April with nine thousand. After this junction, they were to march to Cross-creek, by way of Waggamaw, and there join General [Donald] M'Donald. That there was only a sufficient number of men for a garrison to be left at Boston, and that twenty-five thousand men were to be landed in the Jersies, between Philadelphia and New-York, in flat-bottomed boats, and that if they could not possess New-York, they were to destroy it. That the said Collet de- clared, that he would kill man, avoman and child, reserving all the young la- dies for his private pleasures. That the night before last, this deponent, with several other persons, made their escape, and came up to Wilmington; and farther saith not. Peter Simon Sworn to before me, the ninth of March, 1776.

<P>I had also the honour of receiving another Letter from your Excellency dated the 11 th October 1775, in which you assured me in the most positive terms that you had some time before &quot;Strictly forbid all the People under your Government, on no Account whatever to Supply Gun-powder Arms, or other Warlike Stores to any of the Rebellious Subjects of His Britannic Ma- jesty belonging to North America.&quot; I must therefore believe the particu- lars described in the inclosed Paper, has certainly been concealed from your Excellencys knowledge: for I cannot suppose a person of the Compte De No- sieres high Rank and Equitable way of thinking would act with Duplicity in a matter of such Consequence, between our respective Nations. -As my Duty obliges me to transmit the Intelligence to the British Court, I have first ordered Captain Robert Keeler of His Britannic Majesty's Ship of War the Lynx to deliver you this notification, and flatter myself your Excellency will Command an immediate enquiry and Search to be made after the Per- sons, and on board the Vessel described, and thereby enable Captain Keeler on his arrival in England (where he goes Express on his return) to make such faithful representation of the upright Conduct of the Compte De No- sieres as may do him honour, and more strongly cement Friendship and Amity between the two Nations. </P>

<P>To obviate any difficulties that may be made by the Merchants of St Pierre who have engaged in this Traffick, to Ship Gun Powder &amp;c onboard the aforesaid American Vessels in the way of general Trade, I am willing to purchase the same from them at the prices they were to receive from the Americans, and thereby prevent their suffering any loss by my requisition. I have the honour to be with great regard, Your Excellencys [&amp;c.] </P>

I am confined to the limits of the town, but have no allowance either in money or victuals. I have not yet got my protest, which, when I have, I will send duplicates of. A court of admiralty is ap- pointed here, but they have not yet got a judge; they don't however wait condemnation, but sell any thing they like out of the vessel, as they are sure she will be declared a legal prize by an act passed in the general congress. am not so sorry for myself as for my employers, though I can acquit myself very well, having done all in my power for their servi~e.~ </P>

<LBody>&quot;By a letter from the Mate of the Harriot, Capt. Orrock, a transport, which left the Downs the 10th of December, with stores, provisions, kc. for our troops at Boston, there is advice, that after greatly suffering on their passage by storms, they at length got to the Jerseys, and after being refitted by the assistance of the carpenters of his Majesty's ship the Phoe: nix, Capt. Parker ordered them to proceed for Rhode Island, in hopes they might there meet a convoy to see them through the Nantucket shoals: They left New York March 4, at night, and after three days terrible weather the ship grounded among shoals; at length </LBody>

<P>.-</P>

<P>the gale abating, the longboat was hoisted out, and manned with the boatswain and four </P>

<P>seamen, to go to the nearest land for a pilot and assistance. The 7th of March (says the </P>

<P>writer) we saw a sloop making towards us; she run under our stern full of men; they </P>

<P>asked if we wanted a pilot; the Captain said he did, and requested one to be sent: They </P>

<P>sent a boat with four men, and one was left in the Harriot as a pilot, who asked the Cap- </P>

<P>tain how many hands he had? It was answered, that five men were sent on shore, and </P>

<P>that only two were left. The pretended Pilot then offered to send for two or three out </P>

<P>of the sloop, but he called after the boat, to send all the men the boat could carry; on </P>

<P>which Capt. Orrock began to suspect something, and asked the Pilot whether he intended </P>

<P>to take the ship? To which no satisfactory answer was given; the arms were then ordered </P>

<P>upon deck, which consisted of six very indifferent muskets, six old cutlasses, with two </P>

<P>swivel guns on the ship's bows. The Captain ordered the Pilot to carry the ship through </P>

<P>the shoals, else he would put him to instant death; but the man begged for mercy, de- </P>

<P>clared he was ignorant of the place, and incapable of doing it; and was ordered to the </P>

<P>cabbin. About this time we saw our boat making for us from the shore; but the sloops </P>

<P>people seeing her also, bore down and took the boat, and in a few minutes the ship [sic </P>

<P>sloop] bore down upon us, within musket shot, with about fifty men in her; they fired a </P>

<P>volley of small arms at us; we returned a fire from our swivels and small arms, and con- </P>

<P>tinued the engagement for half an hour; being in want of shot, having only nine balls at </P>

<P>first for the swivels, we took the lead from the cook's hearth, and cut it into slugs, re- </P>

<P>solved not to surrender wh~le we had ammunition left; at last Capt.Orrock, whose intre- </P>

<P>pidity and courage cannot be too much commended, took one of the swivels in his arms, </P>

<P>to carry it aft the ship, and whilst in the act of pointing it and firing, was shot through </P>

<P>the fleshy part of his thigh; he fell on the deck, and was carried to his cabin, bleeding </P>

<P>very much. This misfortune deprived us of one of our bravest hands, our ammunition </P>

<P>also spent, the ship aground, and no hopes of escape now remained; I, therefore, by the </P>

<P>Captain's consent, gave the ship up to the Americans, who took possession of her. They </P>

<P>were such dastards, that they placed our five men, whom they had taken in the boat, be- </P>

<P>fore some of them, and rested their muskets on the mens shoulders, to screen themselves </P>

<P>from our shot: They were a set of ruffians, and a disgrace to the name of men; by ex-</P>

<P>perience we found them far short in true courage to Englishmen; for fifty of them well </P>

<P>armed, and supplied with powder and ball, their sloop afloat, and our ship on shore, did </P>

<P>not dare to board us, which they might have done, as the sloop drew little water. As </P>

<P>soon as they came on boa~d, they rat and drank the Captain's provisions and liquors, set butts of porter on end, and stove in their heads, to drink greedily, rummaged and plun- dered every thing, taking even our clothes from us. The only instance of humanity they shewed, was, they sent Captain Orrock ashore with some degree of tenderness to the pre- tended pllot's house, put him to bed, and got a surgeon to dress his wound, and before I left America I had the pleasurc to hear he was getting well. We were carried to an is- land named Martha's Vineyard, a mile and a half from the main land of New England, from thence Mr.Christie, an officer of the army, who was a passenger with us from New York, and all our crew, were conveyed in the sloop which took us to Plymouth, where we were examined by a committee of the town, and then sent, under a strong guard, to the head quarters at Cambridge, where we were put into a prison; but by the favour of Gen. Washington I was released the same day; also my brother, a boy.&quot; London Chronicle, June 27 to June 29, 1776. </P>

<P>Dear sir Philada March 10th 1776 I was sorry to find by your Note of the 8th that you determined to wait at Chester for the Pilot Boat, because certain Gentn seem exceedingly anx- ious that you shoud be gone Pc you know well how tedious &amp; troublesome it is to obtain decissive orders on any point wherein Public Expence is to be incurred. I cou'd not send a Boat without orders unless at my own Ex- pence, and altho I obtained such orders yesterday, yet I was so harrassed between the Assembly &amp; Congress that it was not in my power to dispatch her, I am attempting it this Morning &amp; hope she will depart in time to put this onboard the Brigt and then run down before You. You will find here- in a letter from your Brother which Doctr Franklyn &amp; myself thought best to open least it might be of disadvantage to him or you &amp; cause some disapoint- ment about the Money you left for .him, but you'l find it is not of Conse- quence in the way of bussiness.

<P>A Man of Warr &amp; two Tenders were within about 20 Miles of Balti- more and the People there preparing a Warm reception for them. The Molly Cap Lawrence had got back into that Harbour and I think will be de- fended with others now lying there, Powder, Arms &amp;c are on the way to them and I think no great harm will be done in that quarter. I think you shou'd not loose one Moment, the sooner you are on the Oce[an] the better chance of arriving safe &amp; of not being interrupted on your Voyage: but the Sea will Swarm with Men of Warr &amp; some Privateers before long The Peo- ple in Antigua were applying for Commissions to fit out Privateers against us. I hope they will live to repent it. A report is come up from Virginia that Colo [Richard] Corbin who went onboard Ld Dunmore's Fleet by his Ldships invitation was returned &amp; says he saw Genl Clinton, that Commis- sioners are Certainly Coming out from England to treat and offer the terms of 1763, but that they can only Treat with the Colonies seperately &amp; will have nothing to do with the Congress. if this be the case they may as well stay where they are. however I dont think this intelligence comes quite well authenticated yet </P>

Pray dispatch your orders to him directly -I understand from you that you are at Annapolis sufficiently prepared to oppose the landing of any men from the Otter or her tenders -. . .

<P>&quot;EXTRACT FROM A GENTLEMAN NORTH-</P>

<P>OF A LETTER IN [NEW BERN,] CAROLINA DATED</P>

<P>TO HIS FRIEND IN THIS CITY [PHILADELPHIA], MARCH 10, 1776.&quot; </P>

<P>Governor Martin has threatened the destruction of Wilmington, if they do not supply him with provisions. The town has spiritedly refused to sup- ply him with a single mouthful, notwithstanding the cruizer and three armed vessels lay opposite it, and they have told the Governor he may do as he pleases, as they are determined to resist to the last. They have a good battery there, and four hundred chosen men, under the command of a brave Irishman, Col. William Purviance, who is determined to see it out with them. The women and children are sent out of town. The Tories are all secured in Wilmington jail, to the number of twenty-five. Capt. Parry, of the cruizer, has meanly begged a few quarters of beef, which the town has re- fused him, and the vessels dare not begin the attack, though we daily expect to hear of an engagement, as they are a starving. </P>

<P>It was humurous enough in the inhabitants of Wilmington, when the Governor haughtily demanded one thousand barrels of flour, after answer- ing him fully on that head, they then went immediately into the insurrec- tion, and what a hopeful situation he had reduced his friends to, that were surrounded by large, spirited, and powerful armies, who were determined to make short work with them. </P>

<P>The Negroes at Cape Fear were never known to behave so well as they have lately. Yesterday two prisoners, a midshipman and a common seaman, were sent out of this town to Halifax. </P>

<P>We have now in arms, to the southward of this town, nine thousand four hundred men. General Clinton, we expect to hear every moment, is landed at Cape Fear, with the troops under his command. As soon as we </P>

<P>292 AMERICAN THEATRE 
</P>

<P>learned he had sailed from Virginia, sent off an express instantly to our com- manding officer there, to be ready for him. The Gov. of South-Carolina is at Cape Fear; Clinton, Martin, and Lord William Campbell, are to settle the plan of operations as to the subjugating this province, South-Carolina, and Georgia. Tomorrow we send off two gentlemen to South-Carolina: do expect the moment Clinton lands, this province, Virgiinia and South-Car- olina will march an army of twenty thousand men against him. You never knew the like in your life as to true patriotism, not a man of any influence is left in the back country, nor on Cape Fear, all to a man turned out upon the first alarm in defence of their country. </P>

(who only arrived at two o'clock This afternoon,) and then too much fatigued to proceed; but shall embark to-morrow morning early, on board of a sufficient number of proper boats, that I Ilad provided, and mounted swivel guns on them. By the latest accounts, Savannah is sate; and no troops landed. </P>

Vessels in all, having on Board about 1600 bls of Rice, &amp;Several other things, this was Effected With- out the Loss of a Man, but as I well knew it would, so it has, reduced this Province to the most deplorable Situation. -The Rebels are Skulking &amp; in-creasing every day, Since they found the Troops did not Land, and are now Said to .be' 700 Strong, and Reported that they have Raised 200 of their Bat- talion, and have been reinforced by 600 Foot 8c 60 Hor[s]e from So Carolina, and have Seized on a great Many Negroes who are Employed in throwing up Works &amp;Fortifying the Town, &amp;putting it in the best State of Defence &amp;re-sistance, Which they Possibly can, and I am perswaded,,will oppose any Troops, Which may be Sent against, or Attempt to take Possession of the Town &amp; force them from it. -and thus Sir you See what a difference a few days have made in the State of affairs here, and I must beg Leave to Observe that not one barrel of Rice more, can ever be got, in the way this Quantity has been, and their getting the above, was very nearly Prevented, for the Rebels Set fire to a Ship, With an intention to Burn them all, but very hap- </P>

<P>time is Precious, the hot weather will Soon Set in &amp; then your Troops Can't act so well &amp; may begin to be Sickly, therefore not a day is to be Lost, if any thing is Meant to be done here, if they come Soon &amp; Carolina is At- tack'd at the Same time, the affair will Soon be Settled, but not less than 1000 will do now. It is Reported they have a Party of Indians, 100 or up- wards, but this I will not assert, as its only Vague Report wch says they are to Guard the Sea Island to Prevent Provisions being taken off. this may be True, or not. but without Immediate assistance this Province is totally Lost &amp; Ruined.

We flatter our- selves that you will consequently be so kind as to oblige them. Boards and timber become very rare on this Island, as does sail-reef [sic] material. If you can expedite some ships loaded with these cargoes, you can not but succeed. If you can add also some codfish at a reasonable price, it will be even better. Let the wood be white or from the North, and the sale will not be more difficult for it. We will take for our account the cargoes which you send at the highest price which is offered for them. Let us make the most prompt expedition. If you send horses, it is necessary to send only the most handsome and gentle. . We have need of thirty pieces of timber thirty (28 to 30) feet long and </P>

<P>Watertown, March 1 1. We hear that a Transport Brig of 14 Guns laden with Naval stores, and provisions bound from Boston for the Ministerial fleet at the Southward, ran ashore at the back of the Cape, the beginning of last Week: -On seeing of which, a number of People went on board and dismasted her, and after- wards safe unloaded her. She had on board five barrels of powder, and about £ 500 Sterling in Specie, of which good care is taken. She hove over three of her Guns before she struck. Capt.

<P>March 11 [1776]. -This morning 1rose very early aad very luckily went to my 'warehouse; when I came there I found Mr. Crean Brush with an order and party from the Gen'l, who were just going to break open the ware-' house, which I prevented by sending for the keys,,and opening the doors. They took from me to the value of twenty, two hundred and sixty pounds sterling, according to the best calculation I could make, in linnens, checks, cloths, and woollens. This party behaved very insolently and with great rapacity, and I am very well convinced exceeding thCir orders to a great deg-ree. They stole many things and plundered my stbre. Words cannot describe it. This party consisted of Mr. Blasswitch, who was one of the cA-ceaux people, Mr. Brush Mr. [William] Cunningham, a refugee, Mr. Welch the provost deputy, a man named Hill, and about fifteen soldiers, with others. I remained all day in the store, but could not hinder their destruc- tion of my goods. </P>

<P>Since a few of this day's papers were struck off, we hear the above ship is a man of war of 64 guns. Last Tuesday night we had a very heavy gale of wind here, from S.E. to </P>

<P>The Congress were informed that William Douglass, Andrew Van Tuyle and Isaac Simonson, had made affidavit as to the loss of the pilot boat Hamden, in the manner formerly directed for the other owners; the said af- fidavit being read and filed, is in the words following, to wit: </P>

<P>[Here is inserted their Indenture of March 9,17761 Ordered, That William Douglass, ~ndrew Van Tuyl and Isaac Simon- sen, be paid for one-quarter part of thb pilot boat called the Hamden the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds, and for one-quarter part of the wages or hire of the said boat and her mariners, the sum of twenty-two pounds ten shillings, on their executing a proper conveyance for one-quarter part of the said boat, and delivering over the papers relating to the said boat to Mr. Ja- cobus Van Zandt, and entering into covenants with Mr. Van Zandt that if any moneys shall be allowed for the said boat or for the service or detention of the said boat while employed in His Majesty's service, that they will pay one-quarter part thereof to Mr. Van Zandt, and also a covenant that if it shall hereafter appear that the said boat was taken by collusion, or any de- </P>

<P>The Congress are of opinion that the said schooner may be very detri- mental to the trade of this Colony and the neighouring Colonies, and at this critical juncture, in particular, as ammunition, arms and.other necessary stores may thereby be seized and prevented from being landed: Therefore, </P>

<P>Ordered, That the marine committee of this Congress take the' exami- nation of Mr. Barnard [into consideration, and ascertain] what may be ne- cessary to be done by this Congress, and report thereon with all possible speed. </P>

<P>A member informed the Congress that Mr. Foxcroft is under apprehen- sions that the order of this Congress made yesterday, permitting him to go to the ship Asia, for the mail from England, and to bring the same on shore, may be considered as obligatory dn him to bring the same on shore, and that he may in the said mail receive'inst'ructions from his superior in office, to the contrary. Thereupon, </P>

<P>Resolved, That the order of this Congress of yesterday for permitting John Foxcroft, Esqr. to go to His Majesty's Ship Asia for the mail from Eng- land, was by no means intended to'be obligatory on that gentleman to do any act contrary to his instructions, or to oblige him to bring the said mail on shore, but only to operate as a permission to him to go on board and re- turn with the said mail if he should thinkproper. , </P>

<P>Mr. [Thomas] Randall from.the marine committee, reported the said committee are of opinion on the information received from Mr. Bernard of Elizabeth Town, and from other circumstances, known to them, that a letter should be immediately written to the Honoble.

<P>[Extract] ~h[iladelphi]a Tuesday morning 12th March 1776 . . .An armed vessel purchased for our province in Statia is arrived here with 2000 lb of powder, 8c a cargo to a very considerable amount, The greatest part of wh is the property of our Province: the most material which is coarse linens.&quot; . . I wait with impatience to hear the event of Capt Ni- cholsons attack of the Otter: Since R. Lee brought 1st word that he was to sail in 2 hours.after he left Baltimore to fight the Otter I fancy they will think better of it: as I fancy the Otter is superior to Nicholson's ship.. .. </P>

<P>Rhode Island is pestered by [Captain James] Wallace and his ships, who hardly ever lands but he loses more' oi- less of his men; he carries on the war in a very piratical maher. Every now and then he lands to steal sheep, kc. at which time, if he can, he burns houses and murders the helpless, not dar- ing to wait; and as soon as.he sees any of our armed men coming, he flies. </P>

<P>Pennsylvania is still unattacked, but preparing for the worst. Our riv- er is defended by cheveaux-de-friez sunk in the channel (on which no less than three vessels have been sunk by the carelessness of pilots) a very large and strong chain; a battery; a 20 gun ship; a large floating battery to carry 20 eighteen pounders; and 13 row gallies, with an eighteen pounder in their bows, and 50 men properly provided in each; three baGalions of regulars, and from 30 to 40,000 militia. </P>

<P>Nothing has happened in Virginia since the entire destruction of Nor- folk, but they are there, as well as in North and South Carolina, preparing for the most vigorous defence; . . .But where are your resources, say you? Money we have sufficient. By our industry abroad, we have got safely landed in different parts of this Continent (notwithstanding the low arts of the iVfinistry and all their men of war) upwards of 100 tons of powder, 150 tons of saltpetre, and a large quanity of small arms, which will supply us for the first part of the campaign; for the other, we expect to, be under no obligations to any state on earth for the stores, &amp;c. </P>

<P>In a short time we shall have at least 30 ships of war, from 38 guns downwards, besides (if the Ministry carry on their piratical war) a great number of privateers. . . </P>

<P>His Excellency the Commander in Chief inform'd the Council, That from the appearance of the Ministerial Fleet and Army. -The intelligence he had receiv'd from sundry Persons who had escap'd from Boston, and from frequent observations, he had reason to beleive that the Troops were about to evacuate the Town; that in all probability they were destin'd for New York, and would attempt to possess themselves of that City, by which means they would command the Navigation of Hudson's River -open a Communi- cation with Canada -and cut off all intercourse between the Southern and Northern Colonies. -</P>

<P>His Excellency then demanded the opinion of Council, whether under the present Circumstances (i.e, before the Town was wholly evacuated), sit would be advisable to ma~ch any part of the Continental Army (now before Boston) to New York. -</P>

<P>The Council were of opinion that it will be proper, that five Regiments with the Rifle Battalion should be detach'd immediately to New York -The Rifle Battalion,to march tomorrow, and the others to follow as speedily as possible. That his Excellency-be advised to write to the Governor of Con- necticut to desire he would immediately send two thousand of the Militia of </P>

<P>his Government to New York, and that one thousand be requested from the Convention or Committee of Safety of New Jersey. -in order to reinforce the Troops. already station'd, there, until the .detachment from this -Army shall arr'ive. </P>

<P>His Excellency 1ikewise.demanded the opinion of Council whether, if the Ministerial Troops should totally abandon the Town of Boston, it would be necessary to continue any part of the Continental Army for its de- fence. </P>

<P>Resolved, that-if the ~inisteri-a1 Troops should totally abandon the Town of Boston, it will be unnecessary to employ any part of this Army for the defence and Security of the same. -as the Militia of the Province will be adequate thereto. -</P>

<P>The opinion of the Council was also demanded by-his Excellency, whether, if the Ministerial Troops should continue in the Harbour of Bos- ton, it would be advisable to fortify Newk's Hill in Dorchester. -</P>

<P>Resolved, That if the Ministerial Troops should continue in this Har- bour to morrow it would be'advisable to fortify Newk's Hill the nextZNight at all Events. -</P>

<P>[Extract] Cambridge March 13 1776 Sir, In my Letter of the 7 &amp; 9 Instant which I had the honor of addressing you, I mentioned the Intelligence I had received respecting the embarkation of the Troops from Boston &amp; fully expected before this, that 'the Town IYOU'~have been entirely evacuated -Altho I have been deceived and was rather premature in the opinion I had then formed, I have little reason to doubt but the event will take place in a very short time, as other accounts which have come to hand since, the sailing of a great number of Transports from the Harbour to Nantasket Road and many circumstances correspond- ing therewith seem to confirm and render It unquestionable. -Whether the Town will be destroyed is a matter of much uncertainty, but It wou'd seem from the destruction they are making of-sundry Peices of Furniture, of many of their Waggons, Carts &amp;c which they cannot take with 'em, as It is said, that It will not, for If they Intended It, the whole might be involved in one </P>

<P>3.</P>

<P>general ruin. </P>

<P>Holding It of the last importance in the present contest that we shou'd secure New York and prevent the Enemy from possessing It, and conjectur- ing they have views of that sort and their embarkation to be for that pur- </P>

<P>pose, I judged it necessary under the situation of things here, to call a Coun- cil of General Officers to consult of such measures as'might be expedient to be taken at'this-interesting conjuncture of .Affairs -A Copy of the proceed- </P>

<P>MARCH 1.776 </P>

<P>Should their Destination be further Southward or for Halifax (as re- ported in Boston) for the purpose of going into Canada, The March of our Troops to New York, will place them near the Scene of Action, and more convenient for affording Succours. </P>

<P>As New York is of such Importance, prudence and poky require, that every precaution that can be devised, shou'd be adopted to frustrate the de- signs which the Enemy have of possessing It -To this end I have ordered Vessels to be provided and held ready at Norwich for the embarkation and transportation of our Troops thither -This I have done with a view, not only of greatly expediting their arrival, as It will save several days marching, but also that they may be fresh and fit for Intrenching and throwing up Works of defence as soon as they get there, If they do not meet the Enemy to contend with; for neither of which, wou'd they be in a proper condition af- ter a long and fatiguing March in bad roads -If [James] Wallace with his Ships should be apprized of the measure and attempt to prevent It by stop- ping up the Harbour of New London, they can but pursue their March by Land. </P>

<P>induced to believe &amp; hope that there is every rational prospect of securing the town of Baltimore in Case of the Otter returning with any other Frigate that can come up this River. And as the ship defence may be so stationed as to support the Batteries &amp; Boom at Whetstone it will be of the greatest importance for the preservation of both the Town &amp; ship, that she should not be ordered out of this harbour, -The attention of our workmen being entirely engaged since last week on the Batteries at Fells Point, the Boom is of consequence less forward than it otherwise would have been. But to avoid every possible hazard of its being too late, It is agreed (with the advice of Captn Nicholson) to sink all the vessels now collected at Whetstone Point, which will serve the purpose until1 the Boom now executing is compleated. We have got the vessels all valued &amp; ballasted, and Persons are appointed to begin sinking them tomorrow. -The Battery at Whetstone will be ready to mount several guns in a few days; even now it can be used on emergency. At Fells Point the Breast Works fit for 19 or 20 cannon will be nearly compleated tomorrow . . . I am [&amp;c.] </P>

<P>[Extract] Head Quarters Cambridge 14 March 1776 . . . I am inform'd by two very intelligent Men who made their escape from Boston, that they embark in great Confusion -are oblig'd to destroy many of their Carriages &amp; Waggons for want of Room to transport them -That they are greatly distress'd for Seamen to man their Transports, and that the few they have are put on half allowance, Provisions being so scarce that they have not more than sufficient for four Weeks. -I am much pleas'd with your plans for the defence and Security of New York, -what you may leave unfinish'd-I shall order the Commanding Officer to compleat as soon as possible -Lest the Enemy should meet with favorable Winds in their passage and get there before our Army. -I have wrote to Governor Trumbul desiring him immediately to forward two thou- sand Men, and have also requested One thousand from the Jersies -This with the Force already there I hope will be able to keep the Ministerial Army at Bay until I can arrive with the Main body. </P>

<P>Watertown, March 14 A great number of letters for officers in Boston were taken in the ship Capt. Manley.sent into Portsmouth I (as mentioned in our fast) many of which mention great difficulty in raising recruits for the American service, and that it was apprehended the British army will be very little superior, the ensuing campaign, to what it was the past. Yesterday 7'night Capt. Manly sent into Cape-Ann another fine prize, a ship of 300 tons, out 17 weeks from London, bound to Boston. Her cargo consisted of 180 casks of porter, and 50 casks of sour krout, together with coal, cheese, &amp;c. She also brought out 164 live hogs, but only 3 of them lived through the passage.' A large Ship of 300 Tons Burthen, laden with Coal, Porter, Cheese, &amp;c. which had been out from White Haven about 16 Weeks, after having re- ceived considerable Damage, and been repair'd at New York, was on last Friday 7 night taken by a small Shallop of about 26 Tons, and between 20 to 30 Hands, with only small Arms, after about one Hour's Resistance, and carried into Dartmouth. The Captain of the Ship, before he struck, re- ceived a Ball, tvhich went through his Thigh. She had on board a very val- uable Box of Jewels, and is supposed to be worth at least 2 2500 Sterling. This, it is said, is the seventh Prize from White Haven, and the last, it is currently reported, and believed to be true,3 Capt. Manley drove on Shore, the Beginning of last Week, at Squam, near Salem.4 We also hear a Sloop laden with Provisions for the Ministerial Butchers at Boston, was taken and carried into Dartmouth the same Day -We have not yet heard where she was from. </P>

During our fire upon them they returned it warmly with Shot &amp; Shells, but thro' the good Providence of God, we lost but one Subaltern &amp; four privates in this Camp, and one private only in Cambridge.

<P>Since we are possessed of the heights which command the Town, it is gener- ally apprehended the Pirates will go to New York or the Southern Colonies. Mav all the winds of Heaven oppose them. If the Enemy leave Boston, I trust measures will be immediately taken to prevent them from being able ever to come into the Harbour again. </P>

<P>A copy of the examination of Craigg was brought into the Con- gress by Mr.Robert Benson, who, by order, had called in Lord Stirling and had taken a copy from the original, which was taken by his lordship. The said copy of the examination was read and filed, and is in the words follow- ing, to wit: </P>

<P>Craig, lately a soldier in the first regiment of Yorkers, declares that he was employed by one Vernon, a hatter, of this city, to rig out a sloop the said Vernon had lately purchased, by order of Govr Tryon, to be employed by the Governor as a tender or cutter, and occasionally to cruise in the North and East rivers; that the said Vernon was to be supplied by the said Governor with swivels for the said sloop; that the said Craig went on board (with the said Vernon) of the Dutchess of Gordon, and there conversed with the Governor and the Attorneys-General [John Tabor] Kempe and [Courtland] Skinner, who urged him to be active in procuring as many men as possible, not only for the said sloop, but for the Asia and other men of war soon expected here; that above 50 or 60 soldiers now in town, in the Continental service, were engaged by the said Vernon for the service of the ministry. </P>

<P>That your Petitioner is well affected to the cause of his country, and is out of employ on account of the distressed times; and seeing no probable way of getting into business again to maintain his wife and children until matters are accomodated; and your Petitioner understanding that there is a vacancy for a Lieutenant in one or more of the Artillery Companies raised in this City, as also of Masters and Lieutenants in the vessels on the Lakes, and likewise in those that are building up the North-River, he offers himself as a proper person to fill up either of the said vacancies. </P>

<P>Your Petitioner therefore, humbly prays that this honourable House will take his case into their most serious consideration, and grant him a com- mission in either of the above-mentioned vacancies as they in their wisdom shall think most proper. And your Petitioner, as in duty bound, shall ever pray, &amp;c. New York, March 14, 1776. </P>

<P>On Sunday last arrived the Swallow Packet, Capt.Copeland in 9 Weeks from Falmouth, which he left the 7th of January, with several Passengers, and a very large Mail, which we hear was taken on board the Asia Man of War. </P>

<P>The ship Julius Caesar, Capt. John Thomson, of Chester town, Mary- land, having safely landed her cargo at Falmouth, received freight, and the ship being discharged, the men were also paid off and discharged, and the ship lade up safe in the harbour, for the benefit of those concerned, viz. Mess. Smyth and Ringgold, Chester town, Maryland. </P>

<P>From undoubted authority we can assure the Public, that a ship belong- ing to Messrs. Franklins, loaded with salt and wine, sometime ago taken by the men of war here, and sent for Boston, was, on Wednesday last cast away on the rocks on Montock point, at the east end of Long Island; the vessel is entirely bilged, and the salt all run out; the people had great difficulty to save their lives, some of them being much bruised when taken out of the water. There were 14 men and an officer belonging to the Asia, on board, who were all made prisoners, and on Monday they set off with a strong guard for this city, and may be expected in a day or two. -The officer is named Smith, and said to have been very active the night the Asia fired on the town; he behaved with great insolence, and ordered Colonel Mulford to provide a coach to carry him on board his ship.l </P>

<P>[Philadelphia] Thursday, March 14, 1776 The committee appointed to confer with General Lee respecting the de- fence of New York, brought in their report, which was read: Whereupon, </P>

<P>The command of the passage of the Sound must be ours. this I imagine is already effected by the works thrown up at Horne Hook; but as a farther security, batteries and a redoubt must be erected on the other side, either in [Montresor] Island or on the Continent of Long Island, as the Engineer and succeeding General shall determine. these additional works are not solely meant to shut up to the Enimy the passage through the sound, but to secure a free open and easy communication to our own Troops betwixt the Continent of New York and Long Island. As the City of New York is almost environ'd by navigable waters it is undoubtedly very difficult to fortify it against a powerful sea armament; but still I am of opinion that although Troops cannot easily be prevented land- ing under the Guns of their shipping, they may be prevented lodging themselves in it, or converting it into a great place of arms as they have done at Boston. the East River, I am almost per- suaded, may be secur'd in such a manner that their Ships will scarcely venture into it, or at least they cannot keep their stations when in. a Battery for this purpose is plan'd and in some forward- ness at the foot of the Jews burying ground, to protect this Battery from the near approach of Ships (which when close are always sup- posed to be an over match for Batteries level with the water and in a low situation) Guns in barbet placed on the heights of the Jews burying ground, when in correspondence with a Battery I have or- dered on an opposite commanding knoll in Long Island, will certainly be sufficient. these two fires will likewise be cross'd by a third of very considerable range from a work in the front of our trench'd Camp in Long Island, which work is likewise answered by a Battery sunk in a celler on the opposite Wharfe. such is our plan with respect to the east River, haveing attentively examined </P>

<P>the Fort and great Batteries under it and consider'd whether they cou'd be of any possible use to us. I am of opinion that as Ships of great Burthen can approach so near the latter it will be danger- ious if not impracticable to support them. </P>

<P>. </P>

<P>The Fort cannot for the same reason be defended, but as it is not possible in our hands to render it a fortification of offence against the Enimy, it might in their possession be converted into a Citadel to keep the Town in subjection. These considerations have induc'd me to throw down the north East and North West Bastions, with the communicating Curtain, so that being entirely open behind, and a commanding Traverse thrown across the Broad Way with three Guns mounted, it is impossible for the Enimy to </P>

<P>MARCH 1776 </P>

<P>lodge themselves in and repair the Fort. The north River is so ex- tremely wide and deep that it is in vain to think of any means to prevent the men of war commanding the navigation of it, but it does not appear to me, that they have it in their power to annoy dangerously the Town, much less to destroy it, It is true an acci- dental shell may do great mischief, but the effects of their Cannon are not I think much to be apprehended for there is a most fortu- nate ridge of Eminence which not only serves as a screen of protec- tion for the Town but on which any number of Batteries may be erected to keep the Ships at a distance. I must observe once for all that New York from its circumstances can with difficulty be made a regular tenable fortification, but it may be made a most advanta- geous field of Battle, so advantageous indeed, that if our people be- have with common spirit, and the Commanders are men of discre- tion, it must cost the Enimy many thousands of men to get possession of it. The Streets must be traversed and barricadoed, so as to prevent their coming on our Flanks. three Redoubts thrown up on the three eminences Judge Jones, Bayards Hill, and either Lispenards or Haldermans house on Hudsons River, but these measures are not to be confin'd to the Town, the whole Island is to be redoubted in certain regular steps (if I may so express it) quite to Kings Bridge, these redoubts redans or Fliches are such, easily thrown up and are no expense. the leading roads from Hud- sons River whence the Enimy can alone approach must be obstructed to artillery. Kings Bridge must be strongly fortified to preserve the communication free and open with Connecticut, on which Province you can alone depend for succours of men, for the Breadth and depth of the north River renders the Communication with Jersey too precarious. The possessiar, and security of Long Island is certainly of still greater importance than New York. I have accordingly marked out a Camp fortified by a Chain of Re- doubts mutually supporting each other, and which also correspond- ing with the Batteries on the New York side will prevent the Eni- mies entering or remaining in the east River. This Camp is intended to contain four or five thousand men; upon the whole for the defence of Long Island and New York eight thousand, at least, regular Troops will be necessary. With respect to the Fort on Hudsons River in the high Land I must refer the Congress to the report of Capt. Smith who was sent up to examine and who is ex- tremely capable to judge and advise. I have now in a military ca- pacity to the best of my recollection mentioned every circumstance relative to the Defence and security of New York and Long Island, but think it my duty to observe that all these measures will be to- tally fruitIess unless some precautions are taken with respect to the profess'd Enimies of American Liberty nested in the very spots where they can do the greatest mischief Queens County and Staten </P>

<P>Island. The Bonds they have given are too ridiculous to be men- tioned, the association they have signed they consider as forced upon 'em, and consequently null. When our own Troops are obliged to remain inactive from want of arms, when from this defi- ciency the Canada Expedition is at a stand, New York and Long Island left open to the invasions of the Enimy, is it not a most dan- gerious neglect, omission, or rather unaccountable infatuation, to suffer considerable Bodies of avowed Foes to be possessed of arms for your destruction? what possible advantage can result from such a false delicacy? I wou'd therefore humbly propose that the Inhabitants of Statten Island shou'd without loss of time be dis- arm'd and their arms delivered to some Regiment already raised but unfurnished with muskets. I do not imagine that the disarm- ing the Tories will incapacitate them from acting against us, as they can easily be supplied by the Ships. I shou'd therefore think it prudent to secure their Children as Hostages if a measure of this kind (hard as it may appear) is not adopted, the Childrens Chil- dren of america may rue the fatal omissi~n.~ </P>

The report occasioned an order for eight thousand men to be sent to the defense of New York, and that the conve~ltions, committees of safety, assem- blies of the various colonies be urged to disarm all disaffected persons, and that the arms so taken be used to arm3 the Continental troops and militia. </LBody>

<P>Annapolis, March 14. The public will expect some account of the alarm occasioned by the man of war and her tenders; the following is the most perfect we can give at present. -On Tuesday the 5th of March, about seven in the evening, we re- ceived information, that a man of war and two tenders were coming up the Bay and had taken a New-England schooner lying at the mouth of Patuxent -the wind blew hard at S.W. and the general expectation was, that they would be at this place in a few hours -the necessary dispositions were made to receive them in case they thought proper to land, and expresses were dispatched to Baltimore-town and other parts of the province, to com- municate the intelligence -between twelve and one on Tuesday night the wind shifted, and came on a-violent gale at N.W. and so continued all day on Wednesday, during which time we had not any certain information where the vessels were -on Thursday there was a light breeze up the Bay, about two o'clock the vessels hove in sight, and at half past three came opposite this city with some prizes and stood up the Bay. -Off the mouth of this harbour they burnt a shallop loaded with oats, and in the evening an- chored near the mouth of Patapsco. On Friday night we received intelli- gence, that the vessels were the Otter sloop of war and two tenders, and the general opinion was confirmed, that they were going to Baltimore to take or destroy the ship Defence. -On Saturday we expected to hear of an engage- ment, and the rather, as at Baltimore the celerity of their movements ex- ceeded expectation -the Defence being got ready on Friday night, towed down the river, manned with a number of brave fellows, all of whom were </P>

</P>

<P>Americans in their hearts, and most of them by birth; several small vessels attended, crowded with men to assist in case of an engagement, which in all probability would have been a bloody one. -Capt. Nicholson got under way early on Saturday morning, resolved to retake Hudson's ship (a large vessel the Otter had made prize of loaded with wheat and flour) and to engage the Otter, if she moved to assist the tenders, which guarded the prize -the morning was thick and hazy, and the Defence got nearer to them than was expected, before they discovered her bearing down upon them. -those on board the tenders appeared much alarmed, and pushed off with precipita- tion, and on a signal given more hands were sent by the Otter to assist in rowing them off, which was effected with difficulty- three or four small prize vessels were abandoned, besides Hudson's ship. -the Defence having manned the prize, and seeing the Otter get under way, clued up her courses and prepared for battle, expecting her to come up, but the Otter having lain about two hours, as if wanting capt. Nicholson to come down, at length bore away, and in the afternoon came to anchor off this port. Capt. Nicholson continued his station some time, and having performed this gallant action returned with the prizes to Baltimore. </P>

<P>On Sunday morning the Otter sloop and her tenders made sail and went down the Bay, having restored several prisoners taken in a vessel in the mouth of Patapsco. </P>

<P>Having received Intelligence from His Excellency Governor Tonyn and Lieut Grant of His Majesty's Schooner St John, by the Duke of Cumberland Packet which arrived here yesterday from St Augustine, </P>

<P>The Governor and Lieut sets forth in their Letters that several Armed </P>

<P>Ships and Vessels with a number of Armed men, said from Philadelphia had </P>

<P>landed on the Island of Providence and had taken possession of Fort Mon- </P>

<P>tague without any opposition, and that the Rebels had declared they came </P>

<P>344 AMERICAN THEATRE 
</P>

<P>there to carry away the Powder and Military Stores belonging to His Majes- ty and likewise to destroy the St John Schooner. -</P>

<P>I therefore thought it necessary to summons all the Captains of His Majesty's Ships and Vessels now here, and requested the assistance of Sr James Wright Governor of this Province &amp; likewise Majors Grant &amp; Mait-land the Commanding Oficers of the Kings Troops now here, to whom I communicated the above Intelligence, and desireing their Opinions whither it may be advisable to leave this Port and go in quest of the above Rebel Vessels and Forces. </P>

<P>When on mature deliberation it was the unanimous opinion of all pres- ent that the preservation of this Port together with the Ships and Provisions that has been taken and seized, and likewise giving protection to the Gover- nor of this Province and to such of the Friends of Government, who have been under the necessity of leaving Savanah and taking refuge here, and also of giving Convoy to the Transports now loading with Provisions for the Troops at Boston, which is a very material and Important object for His Majesty's Service. </P>

<P>Therefore we cannot by any means Advise leaving this Port to go in quest of the Rebels Ships abovementioned which by the Information we have, in all probability have quitted Providence by this time. </P>

<P>And we are of Opinion when a Convoy is order'd for the Transports the rest of His Majesty's Ships and Vessels will be too few to divide, but that they ought to keep together and remain here for the purpose abovemen- tioned, Especially as some accounts have been received that the above Rebel Armament have intentions to come here and Attack the Kings Ships and take possession of this Harbour, by which event they would get in their pos- session the Vesselsels loaded with provisions &amp; other Valuable Cargoes which is now under our protection. -</P>

<P>And we are unanimously of Opinion that this Intelligence together with the Copies of these Minutes shou'd be immediately Communicated to Sir Peter Parker who is supposed to be by this time arrived at Cape Fear with a large Force. -</P>

<P>And as the Ships rescued from the Savanah are a Valuable property ex- clusive of their Cargoes, there is every reason to believe from the Violence of the people in burning the Ships in the Harbour, that on the Kings Ships leaving Cockspur, the Inhabitants wou'd come down in boats and destroy such of the Vessels as cou'd not be brought back to Town and Force the Sea- men aboard their Privateers. -</P>

<P>Scarborough, Cockspur, March 14, 1776. Sir: We are surprised and concerned that you and the other gentlemen with you, should be confined by the rulers of the people, now at Savannah, as you had a right to protection from the parole that had been given. It is equally unaccountable that the Captains Inglis and Wardell should be carried into confinement, and prevented from sailing with their ships and cargoes, contrary to the faith that had been plighted to them by the very powers which the people at present acknowledge. But as proposals have been made to us for the release of Messrs. Demeri., Roberts, and Rice, and that we wish to remove your distresses and those of your fellow-sufferers, we authorize you to signify to such of the people as take direction in these matters, that if you, Captain Powell, Colonel Tattnall, Colonel Mullryne, the two McGillivrays, Captain Inglis, Captain Wardell, and all others that may be in confinement on this occasion, are set at liberty, and that Lachlan McIntosh, Samuel Elbert, and Joseph Habersham, Esquires, or any others that you my conjoin with them, engage themselves upon honour, by a writ- ing under their hands, for the future security of your persons, families, and properties, while you act a neutral part, and likewise the security of the per- son;, family, and property of the Governour, gentlemen of the Council, and other servants of the Crown, who may not be in confinement, and that you, any, or all of you, shall be at liberty to quit the Province when you or they think proper, and also that the Captains Inglis and Wardell, with other mas- ters of vessels, who may incline to go to sea, shall immediately be permitted so to do with their ships and cargoes; then, and in that case, you are author- ized to'assure the people or their leaders, that we will release the Messrs. De- meri., Roberts, and Rice. The conditions that only require men to be just to their own engage- ments may easily be complied with. An immediate answer is required; and we have the honour to be, sir, [&amp;c.] Andrew Barkley. James Grant. </P>

<P>Sir: Fort Royal, on the Island of Martinique,l4 March 1776 I received the letter by which Your Excellency takes care to remind me of the contents of those which I had the honour to write to him on 11 Sep- tember, 1775 and the 22nd of January last. My way of thinking about the circumstances in which His British Majesty finds himself vis-a-vis his North American subjects has not varied, and consequently I have always acted ac- cording to the principles which form the basis for my views. I can not persuade myself that the agents of Congress, if there exists any on St. Pierre, have found means of evading my defences, and that operations, of such a na- ture as you have spoken to me about, can have been executed without my knowledge. Nevertheless, I am going to make sure about the details which have reached you, and of which Your Excellency has sent me the most exact intelligence. I am writing to this effect before my arrival at Fort Royal which is the place of my residence, to Mr. Begoira, to ask that he tell me of his conduct, and to be instructed if he has any knowledge of Mr. Richard Harrison. I will conduct myself appropiately according to the result of this research. I will not dissimulate from Your Excellency that I am astonished at the confidence which he appears to have in intelligence which, if it were authen- tic, could only have reached him through means which I flatter myself to be-lieve that his delicacy would not permit him to make use of. Our islands really lack all sorts of food provisions, and this situation leads us to welcome foreigners who bring in imports. We have even just accorded for six weeks free entry into our ports for supplies of grain, flour, and vegetables. I do not think that this necessity can induce the slightest idea of suspicion in </P>

<P>A </P>

<P>Your Excellency's mind on the sincerity of the sentiments, of which I have had the honor of giving you assurance. </P>

<P>The King my master having accorded me permission to return to France, His Majesty has sent M.Le Comte D'Argout to succeed me in the Government of Martinique. He has the same principles as I have in the present circumstances, and he intends, in informing you of his arrival here, to once again confirm his intentions in our situation to cooperate by all pos- sible means in the preservation of the good mutual understanding which reigns between the respective subjects of the two Crowns. I have the honor to be, Your Excellency, Sir [&amp;c.] </P>

<P>Newbury-port, March 15. The ship mentioned in our last sent into Portsmouth by Capt. Manly,l proved to be 240 tons burthen, having on board 6 double fortified four pounders, 2 swivels, and three barrels of powder. Her cargo consisted of 170 butts of porter, 11 packages of medicines, with large quantities of coal, sour krout, &amp;c. besides a great number of packages for the officers in Boston. She also brought out 64 live hogs, but only twenty of them were alive when she was carried in. A great number of letters for officers in Boston were taken in the above ship, many of which mention great difficulty in raising recruits for the American service, and that it was apprehended the British army would be very little superior the ensuing campaign, to what it was the last. </P>

<P>[Extract] [Philadelphia] Friday morning 15th March 1776 We have taken 5 transports loaded with provisions from England for the Ministerialists -the General [Washington] writes that the enemy are making as fast as possible dispositions to evacuate the town, &amp; to embark their troops they do it in so much confusion &amp; hurry that they do not take an inventory of the stores embarked: should they sail from Boston he has di- rected Commodore Manly to watch their motions &amp; to hang upon [them or] the wings of their fleet to intercept some stragglers -in one of the transports </P>

<P>MARCH 1776 351 </P>

<P>taken were 3 Tons of powder, a valuable article . . . I shall mention some facts related in a letter to John Adams dated London 21 December. the Ministry find great difficulty in raising recruits: wherever a division hath happened between Addressers &amp; petitioners, there have been 9 petitioners to one Addresser. even in Scotland the recruiting goes on slowly: the irish </P>

<P>R.C. will not inlist: France &amp; Sweden have remonstrated against the Russian troops coming over to America: the Empress of Russia declines sending them on pretence that no cartel is settled between England &amp; America -thus far Adam's letter. I will not answer for the truth of all this information from England: what I have mentioned as coming from G.Washington may be relied on -[Robert] Temple brings word that 3 thousand troops were sailed or on the point of sailing the beginning of January for Virga he did not bring advice that there were no more troops coming over to America, but that none were sailed, when he left London but the 3 thousand just mentioned </P>

<P>. . . As commissioners are coming over I do not apprehend any Attack will be made on Annapolis or Baltimore, unless the negotiations for peace should miscarry, wh I think will not be the case if they mean to treat bona fide with us; for I am persuaded all the Colonies are desirous of peace on safe, just, &amp;honorable terms. -</P>

<P>I dine this day with the Massachusets Deputies -Mrs [John] Hancock will be of the party: she is not very handsome, yet handsome enough, and appears to be a most affectionate Wife, of an easy amiable temper. Hancock is well behaved, and generally liked, a proof of a good disposition.- </P>

<P>Saturday 16 8 o'clock Temple was very strictly examined at Falmouth for letters he brought home rapped up in Cotton, wh I believe gives no other information than the destination of the 3000 troops above mentioned -Temple knows no more of the powers entrusted to the Commissioners, than I do, nor does he know who the commissioners are to be: my Lord How is certainly one of them it is said they are to treat Separately with the Colonies and Temple supposes they will treat with the Congress, if they cannot prevail on some Colony to treat with them. We hourly expect to hear that the enemy have evacuated Boston: where they will go to is only conjectured: some suppose to N Y. others to Halifax I am of the latter opinion, because from Halifax, I imagine they will sail up the St Lawrence to Quebec as soon as the weather will permit. it is of great consequence to both sides to be in possession of Canada -Lakes George &amp; Champlain are now impass[a]ble: the ice is too rotten to bear &amp; too much of it to allow of navigation -I suppose if the weather continues mild the lakes will be open in ten days from this time, yet that de- pends entirely on the weather. our instructions are not yet compleated: there remains one thing to be settled, wh occasions no little difficulty the extent of the coercive power to be given us over the military ... </P>

My next must certainly give some Intelligence. -Now for our own News. The Packet arrived last Week at New York &amp; in her came Passengr Mr Robert Temple (Owner of the late beautiful Farm) below our Lines he came to Town last Night, the Report is that in Papers under his Buttons he has brought a Letter from Arthur Lee advising that the Commissioners are coming out instructed to settle the Dispute to get from us as much as they can, but if Peace cannot be had on their Terms to make it on ours. I mention it to you as a Report for to me it seems so inconsistent with all that we have seen &amp; heard that I do not believe a Word of it. I shall get more certain Intelligence soon of his Business &amp; it shall make a Part of my next Letter. . .. </P>

<P>On the 5th instant, about seven in the evening, two boats that are kept down the bay to reconnoiter the motions of the men of war in Virginia, re- turned with the alarm that a man of war and two tenders were close at hand, and expected their intentions were to destroy this city, which threw the inhabitants into the greatest confusion; what with the darkness of the night, thunder, lightning, and rain, cries of women and children, people hurrying their effects into the country, drums beating to arms&amp;. I can assure you it was by no means an agreeable scene. The wind shifting in the storm to the </P>

<P>N.W. prevented the ships gettipg up that night. In this interval the inhab- itants were moving their effects as fast as possible; we moved a few West In- dia goods about ten miles, but were not so much alarmed as many others, having no notion of their firing on {he town immediately without any insult offered them. However, the wind kept them back till the second day, when they appeared off the harbour, and to our great joy standing up the Bay without coming too. Governor Eden sent a boat after them to know what were their instructions, as he had no notice of any ship of war coming into this Province. It proved to be the Otter Sloop, Captain Squire, and two armed tenders, intending to take or destroy a large armed ship fitting out at Baltimore, and get fresh provisions, but not fire on any town. When the Otter got up to the mouth of the river Potapsico [Potapsco], that leads up to Baltimore town, she got a-ground sundry times, endeavouring to get in; not being able to effect this, she sent in her tenders and took a large ship loaded </P>

<P>with wheat and flour belonging to Baltimore, which also got a-ground in coming out, there not being more than 14 or 15 feet water at low tides, which always make with a N.W.wind. Before they could get her off the people at Baltimore got their armed ship ready, well manned, and fell down the river. On the tenders seeing her they sheared off with dispatch and left their prize. The Otter likewise got under sail, and made the best of her way down to the mouth of this harbour, where she came too; we were pretty well prepared in case they had attempted to have committed hostilities. Captain Squire sent ashore a flag to the Governor and Council of Safety: matters were not settled that evening. A second was sent next morning, when they agreed to go off without doing any damage or gettirig any provisions; but we have too much reason to expect a second visit from </P>

<P>them in a few days with a much stronger force, when in all probability they may destroy our city. We have force enough to prevent their landing: God forbid they should attempt it, as it must bring on a horrid scene indeed. We most heartily wish the Commissioners were arrived that we un- derstand are appointed to settle matters, and most sincerely pray a stop may be put to so unnatural and bloody a contest, but are afraid it is gone too far now to be settled any other way than by the sword and the loss of the Colo- nies to Britain. </P>

<P>Head-Quarters, Savannah, March 15th, 1776. Sir, I wrote you yesterday by the post, in which I told you, I should be able to get the matter of the ships settled to my satisfaction. And not many hours after my letter was gone, the Council of Safety sent an order directed to me, as Commander in Chief in this province; desiring, I would immedi- ately have the vessels unrigged, and their rudders unhung; a work I was de- termined to do, ere I left this place, agreeable to the orders given me by the Congress in Charlestown. But, as our Congress depended in some measure on my conducting matters properly, I had before given it as my opinion to this Council of Safety, that it would have a much greater appearance of un- animity in the Colonies, and that Georgia was not so backward as was here- tofore suspected, if they would make it an act of their own. And as the to- ries had yesterday said, the Carolinians had taken possession of Savannah, and meant never to give it up again; I thought it would bear that complex- ion: and it struck the Council of Safety in the same light. On which they resolved, that Lieut. Col. [John] Stirk, with a party of about forty men of their own militia should do the work; only requesting that I would be ready to support them if necessary: and, I accordingly had a sufficient number of men for that purpose -having now under my command four hundred and forty-two, who would have turned out at a minute's warning. Yet, I did not suffer any of our men to appear with arms, or seemingly to know any thing of the matter, but, I ordered them, to keep close to their quarters, which were but a few yards distance from the shipping. However, I have the pleasure of acquainting you, there was no opposition -but, an applica- tion was made to spare the unhanging of the rudder of the ship Georgia Planter, Inglis, alledging, it was so locked under water, that it could not be done. Major -also, applied to have the rudder of his vessel spared; and would have given security for her not departing the province; on which, the President of the Council of Safety waited on me, and mentioned both circumstances. To the first I replied, the rudder might be very soon ren- dered useless, by the help of an axe, cutting it off, near the water -as to Mr. </P>

<P>-'s vessel, I thought they could not with any degree of propriety grant his request, as it would wear the highest appearance of partiality; and would be absolutely repugnant to their own resolution -which was without excep- tion; an order for which, I was then possessed of. However, the officer and men came down; and I sent Messrs. Black and Laurens, two ship carpen- ters, (first making them put off their uniform, ~nd get common clothing,) and mixed with the people, to see that the work was properly executed. They are now at work -several vessels were unrigged -and the rudders un-hung: and by to-morrow night shall have finished, I hope. </P>

<P>A Packet arrived from England two days ago, at Cockspur; after a short passage; and all the letters that they did not suspect came to friends of liberty, were allowed to be brought up, by Mr. -, (a half tory, as he is usually denominated,) as also, An act of Parliament respecting the Boston Port-Bill, and An act to include New-York, North-Carolina, and Georgia, in the restraining bill. Also, the King's proclamation, dated the 22d Dec. last, declaring, that all vessels cleared out, after the first of January last, and tak- en by any of the King's ships, shall be deemed lawful1 prizes -and, it is so particular, as to point out the shares, from the admiral to the swabber. </P>

<P>I have seen a letter from a capital merchant in London to Mr. George Houston of this town, enclosing an extract which he had made with the con- tractors of the victualling office there, to supply all his Majesty's ships that may be stationed or rendezvous here; and that he should also supply, the agents of the Northern Department, with such provisions as could be pur- chased cheaper here, then there. And from the tenor of the letter I appre-hend a number of men of war may be expected. For further particulars, I refer you to the Council of Safety; who will send you copies of all the letters of any consequence: together, with the act of parliament, and proclamation. </P>

Between 70 and 80 vessels of various sizes are gone down and lay in a row in fair sight of this place, all of which appear to be loaded and by what can be collected from our own observations and from deserters they have been plundering the Town. I have been very faithless with re- gard to their quitting Boston, and know not how to account for it, nor am I yet satisfied that they will leave it -tho it seems to be the prevailing opinion of most people; we are obliged to place the Militia upon Guard every Night upon the shoars thro fear of an invasion. There has been no firing since Last Twesday, till about 12 o clock last Night, when I was waked out of my sleep with a smart Cannonade which continued till nine o clock this morn- ing, and prevented any further repose for me; the occasion I have not yet heard, but before I close this Letter I may be able to give you some account of it. </P>

<P>TO JOHN HANCOCK [Extract] Dear Sir New York 16th March 1776 </P>

<P>Since writing to you by express on Thursday last, I have not received any further Intelligence from the Eastward; The Inhabitants of this City and Kings County on Long Island have very Chearfully turned out to work on the Fortifications; every thing is going on as well as the badness of the weather will permit. Two Companies of the Millitia of New ark in New Jersey are coming in this morning and I hope they will soon be followed by others; I have not yet heard from Col. [Elias] Dayton Although I have wrote twice to him. The five Companies of Col. Sinclairs [Arthur St. Clair's] Regiment will be very little detained by coming to this place, as they will now be able to go by water all the way to Albany and they must at any rate be too late to pass the Lakes on the Ice, and too early in the year to cross by water. </P>

<P>March 17th 10 oClock P.M. I have this evening received your letter of the 15th by express. one Company of Col. Sinclairs arrived this day at Hoe- buck [Hoboken] opposite to this City, they will embark tomorrow for Al- bany, the others will as they arrive, embark at Dobb's ferry for the same place. I have for~varded the packet for Governor Trumbull with a letter to him of which the Inclosed is Copy. </P>

<P>I have received no further Intelligence from General Washington, but by accounts from that quarter on Monday last, it appears that the Minister- ial Troops were proceeding in their embarkation; one letter Says that five thousand of them were Actually embarked; Another Account Says that Twenty Odd Ships were Sailed out of the harbour (perhaps with Stores) for I can not beleive they will divide their real force in the presence of our Army. However if they do not Interrupt us in Ten or Twelve days more I hope we shall be in a Situation to prevent they making an Lodgement; un- less it be at the west end of Long Island near the Narrows about which I am very anxious but defer doing any thing there until1 the other works are Compleat and more Troops arrive. Bergen Neck may be so Improved as to preserve the Communication with Jersey and all the Country west of this place in Spite of, them. The people in New Jersey are very uneasy about the Defenceless Situation of Elizabeth Town and Amboy; a decent may easily be made at the latter and is worthy of Attention. The former might be Secured by a Small work on Bergen Neck near the Kills, and a Small Fort and proper Batterys at or near Elizabeth Town point. The powder de- signed for Cambridge will all be shifted by tomorrow evening and ready to proceed by Tuesday, if that be the Determination of the Congress. </P>

<P>By some prisoners taken into Custody there is great reason to beleive that Governor Tryon has his Emissaries in Several parts of the province, en- gaging men to Serve both by land and water; one tells us that he is engaged with Fifty others under a Certain Vernon who was to fit out an armed Sloop to Cruize in the rivers, a Sloop was actually purchased lately by Vernon and we have her along the wharf; I have referred some others to the Committee </P>
