   <P>The Governor laid before The Council a letter from Mr [Joseph] Winniett &amp; Mr [Thomas]
      Williams Magistrates at Annapolis [Royal] giving account of a Sloop belonging to the Pirates
      of Machias, having landed a number of Men at <name>St John</name>'s River where they burnt the Fort &amp;
      Barracks &amp; took a Brig of 120 Tons loaded with Sheep, Oxen &amp;ca for the King's Forces
      at Boston, which Brig they took away threatning an attack on Annapolis &amp; therefore
      requesting that The Governor wou'd take such Measures as may be necessary for their security.
      And <Space/> Sempill one of the Owners of the Brigantine &amp; <name>David Ross</name> one of the
      Navigators, both of whom had been on board the Vessell when she was taken having been examin'd
      &amp; having Asserted &amp; corroborated the relation of the facts set forth in the foregoing
      letter; It was, </P>
   <P>Resolv'd, that application be made to Capn [Edward] <name>Le Cras</name> Commander of His Majesty's Ships
      in this Harbour that he wou'd Order His Majesty's Ship Tartar to proceed as soon as may be to
      Annapolis &amp; there give such Countenance &amp; Protection to that place as may be
      consistent with his Orders. And further it was </P>

      River by Rebells from Machias who have seized &amp; carried away a Vessell laden with Cattle
      &amp; committed other Hostilities there; &amp; whereas other parts of this Province are
      threatned with the same depredations - I have therefore thought fit with the Advice of His
      Majesty's Council to publish this Proclamation hereby declaring that from the date hereof the
      Militia of this Province will be deem'd subject to &amp; be Govern'd by an Act of this
      Province entitled &quot;an Act for the better regulating the Militia on actual Service in the

   <P>The Governor has receiv'd your letter respecting the depredations and Hostilities committed on
      <name>St Johns</name> River, also the Copy of a letter from some of the Rebels of Machias to the Justices
      on that River, which were laid before the Council, on which it was Resolv'd that application;
      be made to the Officer Commanding His Majestys Ships in this Harbour, that His Majestys Ship
      the Tartar may be directed to proceed as soon as may be to Annapolis, and give such
      Countenance and protection to that place, as shall be in his power. </P>

   <P><name>Nova Scotia</name> Halifax 4th September 1775</P>
   <P>I have the honor of transmitting the Copy of a letter relating an Account of Hostilities and
      depredations committed on <name>St Johns</name> River in this Province, the truth of which was confirm'd
      before me in Council, by the Evidence of one of the Owners of a Brigantine which was taken,
      and one of the Navigators, who were both on Board at that time, there is also the Copy of a
      letter, wrote by certain persons, said to belong to Machias, to the Magestrates on that River,
      from whence, and from all Accounts, it appears that these depredations, &amp; those which are
      threatned, are to Terrify and prevent the people of this Province, from providing or sending
      any supplies to the King's Forces at Boston, &amp; that untill there is a sufficient Force, to
      Awe these Rebels &amp; to Countenance the people well dispos'd, all supplies will be prevented
      and Cutt off, &amp; the Province from actual Rebels and disaffected persons will be expos'd to
      imminent danger; as there can be little or no dependance on the greater part of the Militia
      who are too well dispos'd to the Cause of their Countrymen.</P>
   <P>It was therefore resolv'd in Council, that Application shoud be made to the Admiral, that he
      woud Order two Sloops of War to the Bay of Fundy for the protection of those parts of this
      Province. I have the Honor to be &amp;c.</P>

   <P>Watertown, September 4.</P>
   <P>Early last Wednesday morning [August 30] the <name>Rose Man</name> of War, with three Tenders, was observed
      chasing several small Vessels into the Harbour of Stonington, supposed to be from Block
      Island; one of the Inhabitants being down on the shore with a Trumpet, attempting to pilot the
      Vessels into the Harbour, was ordered by one of the Tenders to desist, or he would fire on the
      town; he returned for Answer, he might do as he pleased. Immediately the Tender ran alongside
      of the Wharves, and fired a whole Broadside on the Town and People, which was returned by a
      Volley of Small Arms from the People, and after exchanging several vollies, the Tender bore
      away and join'd the man of war and two Tenders, and before Ten oClock the Rose ship of war and
      the three Tenders were close within 60 or 80 Rods of the Wharves, and began a heavy Fire on
      the Town and Inhabitants until the Middle of the Day, when they ceased for two Hours; in which
      Interval Application was made to know the reasons of these Hostilities, Answer was returned,
      that they began the first Fire on him, (than which nothing can be more false) and after about
      two Hours, the fire began again, and continued till Night. - Thursday Morning they took sundry
      Vessels out of the Harbour, one from Surra.nam belonging to Patuxet with Molasses, and
      appeared as if going into New-London. It is supposed there hath been no Stock yet taken from
      Block-Island. It is surprizing that during this whole Action there was only one man wounded,
      it is feared mortally. Our People killed two Men and wounded several others belonging to the
      Man of War and Tenders. - There is 250 Men now arrived and are on Block-Island, for the
      Purpose of guarding the Stock. </P>

   <P>[Boston] 1775 Sepr 4</P>
   <P>The General now sent the following Answer to the Admirals Letter of the 1st instant. 2</P>
   <P>In Consequence all the Carpenters and Caulkers of the Ships were immediately employed in
      fitting the Symmetry Transport and Spitfire Sloop, under the Direction of Lieut. [Henry] Mowat
      Commander of the Canceaux, whom the Admiral designed for the Command of the Expedition.</P>
   <P>There appearing no probability of manning the Fleet at Boston, either by pressing or
      Voluntiers, as the Trade of the Colonies was almost, and would soon be entirely, at an end,
      the Admiral being unwilling to leave any means unessayed for so desirable an Object, now
      applied, through captain <name>Le Cras</name>, by the Way of Halifax, to the Governor of Newfoundland for
      the purpose. </P>

   <P>(Copy)</P>
   <P>Boston September 4th 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>In your Letter of the 1st Instant you apply to me for Men, Ordnance and Vessels, together with
      a small Detachment from the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and a Detachment of other Troops
      under the Command of a Steady Experienced Officer, as you purpose to lay waste such Sea Ports
      Towns in the New-England Governments as are not likely to be useful to His Majesty's Forces,
      and to Destroy all the Vessels within the Harbours.</P>
   <P>I shall readily supply you as far as is in my Power to do, but if by Men you mean Sailors the
      Transports are already very poorly Manned, many of them out, and more going out to procure
      Articles Necessary for the Maintenance and Subsistence of the Garrison. The Commanding Officer
      of Artillery has Orders to give you an account of such Quantitys of Ordnance and Stores as he
      shall be able to furnish, and it's necessary to be informed of the Places to be Attacked
      before any Judgement can be formed of the Number of Troops that will be required for such a
      service</P>
   <P>The Symmetry and Spitfire you may fit up as you please, but as the Transports here are few, of
      Course few Carpenters can be had from them, I will enquire of them what Number they can
      provide, and of the Officer Commanding the Royal Artillery, whether the Artillery Carpenters
      can be taken off the work they are upon.</P>
   <P>It is to be wished that something of this kind had been proposed at an earlier Period, when it
      would have been more in my Power to have furnished the Supplys you demand, however I shall do
      all I am able in the present Moment, to forward the Plan you have formed, you have been
      acquainted with the Projects of the People to the Eastward from Casco Bay to Machias to make
      some Attack upon <name>Nova Scotia</name>, I hope the Naval Force in the Bay of Fundy and at Halifax will
      Effectually prevent all attempts of that Nature. I am with the greatest Regard and Esteem Sir
      &amp;ca </P>

   <P>I have received your Excellency's Letters August 15 and 16 with Copies of Lieutt Governor
      Franklyn's and Mr Dechamps inclosed. It was certainly a proper measure to send the Senegal to
      the Bay of Fundy, and Captain [Edward] Medows acted very right in not leaving Halifax Harbour
      upon the uncertain information given by Captain Duddingstone.</P>
   <P>By the latest Accounts from Windsor and Annapolis [Royal] I do not find there is a pirate in
      the Bay, the one thought to be about the Bason of Minas is at Mechias, from whence I have no
      Doubt the Rebels will give your Excellency's Government what disturbance they can. I am
      greatly concerned to find you have those amongst you who are not to be trusted. However your
      Excellency may rely upon having every Support in my Power.</P>
   <P>I beg leave to introduce to your Acquaintance Captain <name>Le Cras</name> of his Majs Ship Somerset, who
      is gone to Halifax to refit a leaky Ship; This Gentleman is a very active and experienced
      Officer, and I am persuaded your Excellency will have great Pleasure in carrying on his Majs
      Service with him, as he will readily co-operate in and pursue such Measures for the general
      Safety as shall be judged adviseable on any Emergency.</P>
   <P>I have sent the Merlin with Convoy to the Bay of Fundy, so that there are now two large Sloops
      and two armed Schooners there, and as the Tartar will go to Annapolis, I have not sent the
      Scarborough as I at first intended. His Majesty's Ships shall keep on the Coast as long as
      possible, but your Excellency must be sensible how extremely difficult it will be to prevent
      Insults from the Rebels with Ships alone. I am therefore in hopes, should you not have
      sufficient Succours from General [Thomas] Gage, that a good Body of Militia will be found
      whose fidelity can be depended on. I am &amp;c</P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 4 Sepr 1775</P>
   <P>Your known Zeal for his Majesty's Service encourages me to make known to you the Condition of
      the King's Squadron under my Command with respect to men, and to hope for such Assistance as
      you can afford.</P>
   <P>Besides the common losses by Sickness and by Desertions which have lately much prevailed, we
      have been unfortunate in having a great many good men taken prisoners by the Rebels, and some
      killed and wounded, which has so reduced our Numbers that I am sometimes under the necessity
      of manning the Sloops and smaller Vessels from the large Ships; but these have generally so
      many detached on Harbour Duty, that they can ill afford to be further weakened; and although
      ever since I have had the honor to command on this Station we have endeavoured by pressing to
      Keep compleat yet the Ships are still many short of Complement. </P>
   <P>I should not have troubled you on this Occasion had we the usual Resources of Merchantships to
      get Men from, but Commerce on this Coast will very soon be in a manner annihilated, The
      Congress forbidding what the restraining Acts permit; and I am persuaded you are too well
      acquainted with the Dispositions of these People to doubt their paying implicit obedience to
      Congressional Directions; so that there is almost a certainty of our losing men, and little or
      no prospect of replacing them in the ordinary Method. The Kings Authority is entirely at an
      End throughout the Continent, except in Canada, <name>Nova Scotia</name> and the Floridas; even Georgia has
      sent Delegates to the Congress and entered deeply into the Rebellion. The Spirit of Revolt
      begins also to be discovered in <name>Nova Scotia</name>. It is almost certain that something is planning
      against that Government, but whether by way of Insult and Depredation or of a more serious
      Nature is not yet known; however I have sent the Somerset to Halifax for its Security, and
      hope to effectually prevent any Designs the Rebels may have from taking effect against the
      King's Yard and Stores. </P>
   <P>The Rebels have armed Vessels on the Coast, who at present confine their Operations to stoping
      Supplies coming to us from the Bay of Fundy, and we have Reports of many Pirates of Force
      being out; but are only certain of those from Mechias, and from Providence near Rhode Island.
      I believe by this time not a Ship on the Coast can get supplies, or refreshments of any kind,
      but what are taken by force or Stratagem, At New York excepted where the Asia is allowed what
      is sufficient for herself. The New England Contracts are broke up, those to the Southward I
      suppose will soon fail. Already we have received Supplies from England, and our sole reliance
      for Provisions must be from thence. </P>
   <P>Our situation the approaching winter will be truly critical as the Ships will be exposed to
      the Insults, and, if frozen up, to the Attacks of the most ungenerous and implacable Enemy;
      but under all these disadvantages if we can but get Men, and they continue healthy, we shall
      do tolerably well. </P>
   <P>I flatter myself that as your situation enables you to get young healthy fellows, you will be
      so good to send me as many as can be spared, and if you can add a few Marines, when you return
      to England, it will be doubly serving us, at a time when his Majs Service requires our utmost
      Exertions. </P>
   <P>I do not exactly know who will have the Honour to deliver you this Letter, having directed
      Captain <name>Le Gras</name> to send it by the first Sloop or Schooner that could be got ready at Halifax,
      for at Boston I have not a Vessel of any kind to spare, which makes me wish the Kings Service
      may admit of your ordering one of your Squadron to bring the men to Boston. It is farther
      necessary to acquaint you that the Lighthouse at Boston, arid those on Thatchers Island,
      commonly called <name>Cape Ann</name> lights, are destroyed; that no lights will be shewn this Winter, and
      that all Ships coming this way must beware of false Lights, and also have an Eye on the
      Conduct of any Pilots they follow or may take on board; an Attempt has been already made to
      mislead one of the Transports coming to Boston. </P>
   <P>I beg you to accept my hearty Congratulations on your promotion, and my sincerest Wishes for
      your Health and safe return to England, which I suppose will begin as customary the beginning
      of November. I am &amp;c. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Preston at Boston 4 Sepr 1775,</P>
   <P>Herewith you will receive a Letter for Rear Admiral Duff at Newfoundland, requesting, at his
      going away, to let me have what Seamen and Marines he can conveniently spare, the former I
      suppose may be had, or at least young healthy Fishermen, at the breaking up of the Season. I
      would have you send the Letter to the Admiral either by the Savage or Hinchinbrook, as you
      shall think best; and if the Hinchinbrook goes put the Savage's Guns into her and let that
      Sloop take the four Pounders, if you think them too heavy for the Schooner. The sooner one of
      them sails the better, and order the Officer to return to Halifax from whence you will either
      send him on to Boston or otherwise as shall then be found best for the Service.</P>
   <P>I am informed the Congress have given an Appointment of Admiral to a Mr [Jeremiah] OBrien at
      Mechias, that this Admiral has increased his Squadron to six Sail including the Diligent, and
      that some Plan is certainly forming against <name>Nova Scotia</name>, but at what place he means to begin
      first is not yet known.</P>
   <P>The Rebels have many friends in that Government, Persons of property and influence, and
      capable of doing great Mischief, but I hope the Governor will get a good body of loyal Militia
      on the Western Coast of his Government, and that with our Assistance the Rebels will be
      disappointed in their Views. But we must be attentive and vigilant. These and other
      Circumstances have determined me to let you winter at Halifax and to put the Savage and
      Cruizer under your Command, and I am satisfied you will give the utmost Dispatch to the Ships
      fitting out, and not suffer any of them to lie unnecessarily in Port. I am &amp;c</P>

   <P>On information by letter from Maj. [Jonathan] Lattimer, that one of the vessels lately taken
      by Cap. Wallace of the Rose man-of-war &amp;c. at Stonington was by stress of weather drove
      back to New London with one white man a petty officer, and three negroes on board, and were in

      appears, that two of the negroes belong to D. Gov. Cook of R. Island, and were lately seized
      and robb'd from him with and on board a vessel, by said Wallace, and that the other belonged
      to one Cap. Collins. And on consideration voted and ordered, the major give information to the
      owner of the vessel and on his request deliver her up to him, and send the white man to the
      goal at Windham and the three negroes to the care of and to be employed for the present by
      Cap. [Robert] Niles at Norwich, who is fixing out a small armed vessel 2 &amp;c., until the

   <P>New York, 4th September, 1775.</P>
   <P>You doubtless have by this time heard that the Asia Ship of War, Ct [George] Vandeput, has
      fired eight and twenty cannon, besides grape and cannister shot, into our City in consequence
      of our People's moving some cannon from off the Battery by virtue of an order from the
      P[rovincial] Congress. Our People returned the salute with their musquetry, by which means one
      of their People was killed and (as we supposed) several others were wounded. Three of our
      People were wounded, none killed. But how will you be surprised when I inform you that our
      pusillanimous Congress, notwithstanding these daring Insults, have been driven by their fears
      to a compromise, and have promised to supply the ship as usual with provisions. But we have
      more virtue out of Doors, than in the Cabinet. The People, roused by a just sense of their
      Injuries, have burnt two long boats that were seen coming from the Man of War, and yesterday
      had the pleasure of taking a large sloop with twelve Tories on board, who were supplying one
      of the Transports with provisions for Boston. The scene was really diverting, and our taking
      her with so much ease rather Providential. - A very heavy gale came on Saturday evening
      [September 2] which lasted till Sunday morning at ten o'clock, about which time the sloop
      parted her cables, and the wind blowing hard up the River, after several fruitless attempts to
      reach the Asia, she bore away before it. Our People immediately pursued her in small boats.
      The Asia's tender with about 70 marines besides seamen pursued her. But Vandeput, seeing us
      mounting some twelve pounders upon two sloops and manning them very strong, guessed at our
      Intentions and prudently hove out a signal for the Tender's return, which to our great
      mortification she instantly obeyed. After a ten miles chase they came up with the Boat, and
      altho' every man on board was doubly armed, took her without exch~ging a single shot. When
      they got her to the shore, it being very wet and cold, their compassion induced them to set
      her on fire, by way of warming the Passengers Fingers. </P>

   <Title><name>JOSEPH BELTON</name> TO THE PENNSYLVANIA COMMITTEE OF SAFETY 1</Title>
   <P>Gentlemen,</P>
   <P>Not long since having laid a plan under your consideration, and have not since been able to
      obtain your Oppinions on the same. Wheather you have judged that some conciliatory plan will
      soon be adopted, for which reason there will be no occasion, to encourage any harsh, or
      destructive meathod whatever, if so there is no more to be said. But if otherwise you have
      concluded, that the plan itself might prove abortive, either through the inability of the
      undertaker, or the imperfection of the plan itself, and you by encouraging it with the
      publick's money, would become liable to be censured by the publick for so doing, which to
      remove as well as all other Objections; I will now assert what I will undertake to Perform,
      which is as follows, (viz.) I will make a Machine by the help of which, I will carry a loaded
      cannon, two or three miles up or down any of our harbours without any other assistance, and
      all the way there should nothing appear above the surface much larger than a man's hat, and by
      attracting [siccontracting] my Machine, would wholely decend under warter for some time, and
      by expanding, would rise to the surface at pleasure, and by this means, to avoid any discovery
      when I had arrived within an hundred and fifty, or two hundred yards of a Ship, I could decend
      under the surface, and go along side of her bottom against which, I could discharge the
      Cannon, that should be prov'd large enough to send a ball through any ships side. Now perhaps
      Gentlemen, there will many Queries arise in your minds, as how should I be able to stop
      myself, in a rapid tide with all this Machinery? To which I answer, that I would have a small
      Grapling, which by leting go, I could stop when and where I pleased. But how should I be able
      to see or discover any thing? I would have a thick clear glass in front, and my head just
      touching the top of my Machine, so that when my eyes was just at the surface, all the Machine
      that would naturally be above would not be larger than what I have before mentioned, and it
      would be only requisite now and then to see, that I was floating in a true direction for the
      object I had in view, and the rest of the time, I might be immerged more, so as not to appear
      larger than a man's fist, so by this means begining to float in the Eavening at a large
      distance, just keeping my object in view, which being large I could easily do, when they on
      board could not possably discover any thing of me, and if I found that I floated too fast, and
      was likely to get up before it was dark, and by that means be liable to be discovered, I would
      drop my grapling and ride by it, till I thought proper to proceede, by this means droping up
      with the tide, when I had come with in an hundred yards of the ship, I would drop my grapling
      and by pay-out line gently drop up uncler the wake of her Bowsprit, and under her bows, and so
      long side; and chouse what part I thought most conclusive to effect my purpose. But how should
      I be able to move myself with all this Machinery? I would have fins like fixed at my feet,
      &amp; arms which by pushing from me would naturally expand and take large hold of the water,
      and when drawn to me would attract &amp; take little or none, by this means I could move
      considerable fast, &amp; even venture to stem a small tide. And perhaps you may think that one
      gun would not be sufficient. To which I reply, that two or three may be convey'd in the same
      box, &amp; all discharged by the same lock. And you may think that by any accident I should
      suddenly immerge myself I should thereby be liable to be drowned, to which I answer, that the
      little pipe, which need not exceed two or three inches in length, through which I have a
      communication with the air, at the top of this I would have a valve, which should be kept
      about half open with a feable spring, which by any sudden immersion the natural pressure of
      the warter, would shet perfectly tite, and only take in a spoonfull or two, but allowing I had
      at sundry times, taken in considerable warter, I could be expanding, &amp; keeping a little
      motion with my feet, raise myself higher above the surface than common, &amp; by turning a
      cock just below my chin, I would let out all the warter. For the part which my body was in, it
      being the part which I expanded, should be perfect tite of itself, and should have no
      communication with the appartment of my head, so that a person in one of these Machines need
      never be in danger of drowning. As hearing as well as seeing might in the night be
      advantagious, so likewise 1 would have a small doar in front, which I could open &amp; shut at
      pleasure, by which I could hear perfectly well. But to conclude as experiments will speak
      plainer than words, and being conscious of my own abillities, I will engage to shew
      experimental all that I have herein asserted, and upon my non performance, I will become
      obligated to reimburse all that you may advance; so that the whole expence should then fall
      upon myself, and not the publick. And if I performed according to what is asserted, then I
      should be intitled to such, as you thought my ingenuity and plan merrited, though at the same
      time Gentlemen, I can assure you, that I am not excited so much with the view of incuring
      premiums, as that of sarving my country in so glorious a cause. And would readily engage,
      after making a few experiments, to sink, or destroy, the admirals ship now in Boston, or any
      other ever so difficultly situated, as I can readily conceive, of several other destructive
      meathod might be pursued, some by the Machine only, &amp; some by the Gun only, which I shall
      omit at present, but shall be allways ready to inlarge on, and would likewise prepare similar
      Machines, for as many men as there were Ships of force, and after they had become acquainted
      with the Machine and the effects of it, by makeing seYeral experiments, we would all retire to
      where the ships were, and each man pitch upon a ship, &amp; at a proper time attempt to sink;
      each man his ship, which I can prove might be put in execution at the same minute of time,
      though there might be twenty or thirty ships, &amp; to lay in different parts of the harbour,
      which if this plan succeeded so well as to effect the destruction of the ships, the whole army
      of course, would very easily fall into our hands, &amp; those ministerial tooles, who are now
      impowered, and autllorized, to take the heads of our land, &amp; drag them to an ignominious
      death. I say these very tooles would now fall into our hands to be held out to the redemtion
      of Great Britain. Methinks this nuse would appear to our King, as the hand writing did to the
      grand monarch of old, conscious guilt, of shedding the innocent Blood of his loyal people,
      would now instantly seize him, convulsive terrour shake his whole frame, chilling horrour
      freeze his blood, (perhaps never more to circulate,) dire dismay &amp; confusion overtake his
      wicked Counsellors, be the happy means of opening the eyes of the deluded people, and work out
      a glorious revolution in favour of us now distressed Americans, fix perminent our Liberties,
      reestablish that union which once so happily subsisted between the Parent state and these her
      Colonies, so great, so noble an undertaken, has often almost reduc'd me to dispare, but being
      ever supported with the conscious knowledge, that the overruling hand of Providence, attends
      all the actions of men, and to mannif est its power, it has often been pleased to make use of
      small and obscure means, to effect wondrous revolutions, in defecting armies that were
      engageed in a wrong cause, (even so small as the sling of a stone.) Which to be maid anyway
      enstrumental, of effecting so glorious a revolution, is of itself abundant reward. And as the
      Plan is form'd not to shed Blood, or to trifle with the lives of men, but merely to destroy
      some floating, wooden engines, which are sent to our distruction, Methinks Saints and Angles
      would encourage such a plan, and Heaven itself smile upon it, and if that is for it, who can
      be against it. Pardon, Gentlemen., the intrusion of these so natural reflections; at the same
      time, permit me, to beg your candid sentiments upon what is here disclosed, which will be
      acknowledged as a favour by Your most Obediant [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Mr. Purdie,</P>
   <P>You will be pleased, through your paper, to return capt. Squires, of his majesty's ship Otter,
      my warmest thanks for his very kind hospital treatment of my two slaves Aaron and Johnny, from
      the county of King and Queen, during their stay on board his ship. The publick may be
      informed, that upon notice given me that they were on board, I applied by my overseer on
      wednesday last, through mr. [Andrew] Sprowle, and obtained leave to search for them; but as
      the captain had taken them upon a cruise, they were not then to be found. Providentially,
      however, on saturday evening, during the gust, a tender was drove on our shore, upon Back
      river, commanded by <name>Matthew Squires</name>, esq; in which came on shore the two fellows
      above-mentioned, with a number of other people, who immediately ran off into the woods. On
      sunday morning, two of my neighbours brought into me Aaron, taken up near the wreck; and in
      the evening, Johnny was delivered me from the captain's division. I herewith send you some
      depositions, taken in the presence of gentlemen of reputation in town, which I beg the favour
      of you to publish in your next paper. The originals may be seen at any time.</P>

   <P>Nautilus in Nantasket Road the 5th of September 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>In pursuance of your Orders of the 11th of June, after sending the Transports to Boston,
      Entered Delaware Bay the 20th July, the 22d Anchored off Newcastle in the River, as the best
      Situation for inspecting the Trade, and having Command of the Town, did by that means obtain
      Refreshments, two of the Congress being Inhabitants, yet the Spirit of Opposition at
      Philadelphia and the Country round was such, that they expressed great dissatisfaction at my
      being there, and were ready to enter into any violent Act that should be pointed out to them,
      this with the intricate Navigation of upwards of 30 Leagues from the Sea, and being solely at
      the Mercy of a Philadelphia Pilot, kept us in a constant alarm, but I was daily in expectation
      of some Reinforcement from You, Sir, or at least a Schooner by whom we might have made our
      Situation known. - On the 13th of August at Night, as I have been informed, the Ship Hope
      passed us with a fresh qf Wind and strong Flood Tide, with Major [Christopher] French, [a] 1st
      Lieutenant and a Volunteer, with Packages of Military Cloathing on board; 2 upon hailing, they
      told the Officer on Deck, that they had nothing but Ballast in, and was Eleven Weeks from
      Ireland: had I had the least intimation from the Major or his Party of their Situation, should
      certainly have slip'd and followed her up, but at the time I was acquainted with it, twas too
      late for me to demand Restitution, they were then in the Hands of the Philadelphians who were
      determined to support this hostile Act, had my Orders permitted me to have Attacked the Town.
      Have ever since endeavored to prevent any future fraud by making every Vessel Anchor; as I had
      but one Eight Oar'd Boat, the others being of insufficient Force to prevent being run away
      with, it was a very difficult and tedious task, as the Trade carried on in the Delaware at
      this time is equal to all the rest in America, and this to a great City of 50,000 Inhabitants,
      with several other Towns near to its Banks; this delay made them talk high, my Seizing the
      Tryall Schooner belonging to one of their Committee, <name>Mr Miffiing</name>, and a Sloop with Coffee,
      gave them a pretext, and brought them all in Arms; the Son of the Owner who I had given leave
      to come onboard, after giving him my reason for Stopping the Schooner; desired he might be
      permitted to speak with the Master, which I granted; sent Lieutenant Browne onboard after him,
      who on his going away heard him confirm that the People were in Arms, and that 4,000 had
      offered their Service to his father to make the Attack, and that some Lives should be lost on
      the occasion; I wanted no confirmation of their readiness or Numbers to remove any one Single
      Deck Ship, and therefore with the general Voice of my Officers, thought it most adviseable for
      the good of His Majesty's Service not to put it to the trial, but to make the best of our way
      to Boston with our Prizes, and make a Report of the Situation and preparations making at
      Philadelphia to oppose his Majesty's Arms. </P>
   <P>At this time by our Purser's Account and others, two row Gallies carrying one 18 Pounder in
      the Bow and 40 Men each, including Twenty Rowers, Seven more finished, and to be compleated to
      Twenty as soon as possible; an Establishment of £90,000 is appropriated for Building and
      Manning them during the open Season: their Trade stops the 10th of September, and the Seamen
      will be taken up for that Service and Artillery &amp;ca - Two fire Ships Compleat, near four
      hundred Sail of Shipping, about Thirty of them from 4 to 500 Tons burthen, several of them
      with Ports to take Guns in, with about 2000 Seamen; Twelve Pieces of Cannon mounted in the
      Market Place from: 12 to 24 Pounders ready to be carried to any Spot by the Sailors and one
      Company of Artillery; Twenty large Cannon in a tier and Carriages ready for Mounting them;
      Three Battalions making about 2200 Men well Cloathed and Armed for the Guard of the Town; and
      I am told that from the Entrance of the Capes to the Town, not less than 3 or 4000 more meet
      and exercise Tw_ice a Week, at Glocester Point they have Triangles almost finished, which 'tis
      supposed will effectually stop up the Passage of the Narrows, and may be effected in one Tide. </P>
   <P>I am satisfied Sir, that if a sufficient Force can be spared to enforce Obedience from the
      Town, 'twould be a means, from the great Number of ~eople of Consequence residing there, and
      many Friends that dare not at this time shew themselves with their very great Attachment to
      the Town of Philadelphia, of making the Colony of Pennsylvania very quiet, and a great Number
      might be Recruited for His Majesty's Service. The Taxes Levied by the Congress, has caused no
      little dissatisfaction, for they say if they are to pay Taxes why not to the King, and save
      the Cutting of their Countrymen's throats; there being a great Number of Old England People in
      the Province, Emigrants and Servants from Ireland, that would with some little Encouragement
      join, but now Kept under by the Congress, and their violent Partizans: A Squadron would remove
      the first and Checque the Spirit of the Latter, and I should be very glad to have the Honour
      of shewing the Way.</P>

   <P>We are infested by Ministerial Ships and Transports - I gave your Commissary General a
      Narrative yesterday - beg leave to refer to him, for the haste of this express - Our Coasts
      are kept in continual Alarm, Three Ships of War with thirteen other Vessels of divers sorts
      were seen off Fisher's Island and in the Sound yesterday, they have gained no provisions from
      the Main - have heard nothing from Montaug or any part of Long-Island - New London is in great
      fears, and Stonington expect another Attack - I have Ordered The New raised Levies to Guard
      and defend those two places, and the Coasts as far as Connecticut River - there are likewise
      four Companies of them beyond the river for Defence in those parts - This appears absolutely
      necessary for their Security at present Hope this use of them 'till these dangers are over,
      will neither injure nor hinder any of your Operations. -</P>
   <P>Whether these are the same Ships your Excellency noticed us off remains uncertain - Yesterday
      Ordered the best intelligence to be gained to render that matter more certain. </P>
   <P>Lords day morning [September 3] constrained by the Weather came into the Harbour at New
      London, a Schooner taken by the Rose, <name>Capt Wallace</name> at Stonington four hands on board One a
      White Man sent to Windham Goal, the Other Three Negroes, two belonging to <name>Govr Cook</name>, &amp; one

   <P>As I was on Long Island at the time of the disturbances in this city occasioned by the
      citizens removing in the night of the 23rd of last month Twenty one peices of Ordnance, nine
      pounders, that were mounted on the Battery under <name>Fort George</name> I transmit to your Lordship
      copies of the correspondence that passed between the Mayor of the City and <name>Captn Vandeput</name> of
      his Majesty's Ship Asia on the occasion as the best evidence I can collect of that affair.</P>
   <P>On my receiving intelligence the twenty fourth in the evening of what had passed, that a mob
      had searched my house the same evening though they said for Captn [Edward] Foy, and that a
      party of Provincials had been on Long Island in quest both of Captain Foy &amp; myself, I
      nevertheless the next morning came into Town and got together (not in Council) as many of the
      Gentlemen of the Council as were on the spot, and proposed to them to meet the principal
      inhabitants of the city and country that were in Town in the Council Room at the City Hall,
      Including the corporation, Provincial officers, Committees and Provincial Congress, in order
      to persuade them to desist from carrying things to farther extremities. This measure
      considering the high ferment of peoples minds, my friends approved of and I met the Gentlemen
      the next morning accordingly. When after lamenting the present unhappy controversy, and
      alarming situation to which the public affairs of the Country was reduced I recommended to
      them for the present public safety, that the Guns taken from the battery might remain on the
      Common That no further attempt should be made on the Kings Stores as I was confident a fresh
      attempt would produce fresh disturbances &amp; endanger the city as Captain Vandeput had those
      stores under his protection and must do his Duty. That the town should furnish the Kings ship
      with fresh provisions, but to prevent disorder the Boats from the city might carry the
      provision on Board. I urged how important it was to their own Interest to preserve a temperate
      conduct, and not wantonly to draw down calamity upon themselves but wait the determination of
      Great Britain, as some further plan of accomodation might be held out for the ground of a
      reconciliation. Since I knew it was the warmest wish of the Royal Breast to see us again a
      happy and united people. This was nearly the substance of what I said to them. I was heard
      with Temper - and attention. The city has remained quiet since, and fresh provisions are to be
      delivered on the Governors Isl4-nd for the Asia. </P>
   <P>I sent <name>Captn Vandeput</name> a letter the 25th a copy of which is herewith enclosed to inform him of
      my intention to meet the principal Inhabitants of the Country Since which there has been no
      direct communication between the Asia and the Town. A Boat which carried only some milk on
      Board was burnt on her return to shore as was last Sunday [September 3] a country Sloop for
      having put some provisions on Board of the man of war. Such is the rage of the present
      animosity. For further particulars of our Situation I beg leave to refer you to <name>Captn Foy</name>, who
      from the Frenzy of the times has been pursued and drove from this distracted Country. </P>
   <P>At least one third of the citizens have moved with their effects out of Town and many of the
      Inhabitants will shortly experience the distresses of necessity and want. I am, with great

   <P>Since my last 10th. Ultimo, a large Schooner with Arms, and military stores is taken by a man
      of war in the river delaware, with which she has proceeded to Boston: 2 a Small Vessel with
      Ten ton's of gunpouder came up the river the night before the schooner was taken whether it
      was part of her cargo or not I cannot say, but I am told the pouder is marked with the French
      kings mark: 3 this confirms me in the Certainty of what I wrote in my letter 10th. Ultimo, and
      should the unhappy differences continue, a watchful eye must be keept on the Ports of that

   <P>Sir:</P>
   <P>Your Favor of the 30th August and 2d Inst. are duly received; The Concurrence of the Committee
      in the Bermuda Voyage is very agreeable and I hope will prove a happy Earnest of its Success;
      Inclosed is a Letter to the Inhabitants of that Island of the tenor you have Suggested; but I
      shall depend upon Capt. [Abraham] Whipple's not making use of it, except in Case of real
      Necessity. </P>
   <P>I am to acknowledge your kind assistance to Capt. Bayler in his late Errand, and must desire
      you to make known t.o Messrs. Clark &amp; Nightingale, that I am very sensible of the
      Patriotic and disinterested Part they have acted on this Occasion. . . . </P>
   <P>The Removal of the Stock from the Coast and Islands, will I hope have its Efie~t, in sending
      the Minesterial Plunderers empty home. We have yet no Accounts of the last Fleet, except 6,
      who retum'd from Louisburgh with Coal, a few Days ago. </P>
   <P>I need not mention to you the vast Importance of gaining Intelligence of the Enemy's Motions
      and Designs, as early as possible; The great saving to the Continent both of Blood and Money;
      a Detection of our secret and most Dangerous Enemies, with innumerable other Advantages, would
      result from the Interception of their Correspondence at this Juncture; I have therefore
      thought Proper to propose to you the Seizing the Mail by the next Packet; She is Hourly
      expected from England; her Force of Men and Guns inconsiderable; none but Swivels and only
      mann'd with 18 men. </P>
   <P>If the Vessel proposed to go to Bermuda should cruize for a few Days off <name>Sandy Hook</name>, I have no
      Doubt she would fall in with her; In which Case she might with little or no Delay land the
      Mail, in order to be forwarded to me and proceed on her Voyage; But if there are any material
      Objections to this Mode, I am still so anxious upon the Subject, that I would have it tried
      with another Vessel at the Continental Expence and will for that end direct, that any charge
      which may accrue in this Service shall be paid by the Paymaster here, upon being duly
      liquidated. </P>
   <P>It will be necessary that some person well acquainted with the Packets should be on Board our
      Vessel, or the Stopping inward bound Vessels indiscriminately will give the Alarm and she may
      be apprised of her Danger; The choice of a proper Officer with the care of providing a
      suitable Vessel &amp;c. I must leave to you. should it meet with the desired Success there can
      be no doubt the Honble. Continental Congress will distinguish and Reward the officer and men
      who shall have done so essential a Service; Nor shall I fail in making known to them how much
      the Public Service is indebted to you for your Zeal and Activity on all occasions. I am Sir
      &amp;ca. </P>

   <P>Gentn:</P>
   <P>In the great Conflict, which agitates this Continent, I cannot doubt but the Assertors of
      Freedom and the Rights of the Constitution, are possessed of your most favorable Regards and
      Wishes for Success. As Descendents of Freemen and Heirs with us of the same Glorious
      Inheritance, we flatter ourselves that tho' divided by our Situation, we are firmly united in
      Sentiment; the Cause of Virtue and Liberty is Confined to no Continent or Climate, it
      comprehends within its capacious Limits, the Wise and good, however dispersed and seperated in
      Space or distance. You need not be informed, that Violence and Rapacity of a tyrannick
      Ministry, have forced the Citizens of America, your Brother Colonists, into Arms; We equally
      detest and lament the Prevalence of those Councils, which have led to the Effusion of so much
      human Blood and left us no Alternative but a Civil War or a base Submission. The wise disposer
      of all Events has hitherto smiled upon our virtuous Efforts; Those Mercenary Troops, a few of
      whom lately boasted of Subjugating this vast Continent, have been check'd in their earliest
      Ravages and are now actually encircled in a small Space; their Arms disgraced, and Suffering
      all the Calamities of a Siege. The Virtue, Spirit, and Union of the Provinces leave them
      nothing to fear, but the Want of Amunition, The applications of our Enemies to foreign States
      and their Vigilance upon our Coast, are the only Efforts they have made against us with
      Success. Under those Circumstances, and with these Sentiments we have turned our Eyes to you
      Gentlemen for Relief, We are informed there is a very large Magazine in your Island under a
      very feeble Guard; We would not wish to involve you in an Opposition, in which from your
      Situation, we should be unable to support you: - We knew not therefore to what Extent to
      sollicit your Assistance in availing ourselves of this Supply; - but if your Favor and
      Friendship to North America and its Liberties have not been misrepresented, I persuade myself
      you may, consistent with your own Safety, promote and further this Scheme, so as to give it
      the fairest prospect of Success. Be assured, that in this Case, the whole Power and Execution
      of my Influence will be made with the Honble. Continental Congress, that your Island may not
      only be Supplied with Provisions, but experience every other Mark of Affection and Friendship,
      which the grateful Citizens of a free Country can bestow on its Brethren and Benefactors. I am

   <Title>VICE ADMIRAL <name>SAMUEL GRAVES</name> TO PHILIP STEPHENS1</Title>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> September 6, 1775</P>
   <P>In my last Letter dated August 17th I mentioned the Appointment of the honorable Captain
      Tollemache to the Command of the Scorpion, and my intention to send that Sloop to relieve the
      Cruizer. Captain Tollemache sailed accordingly the 23d with the Palliser Transport under his
      Convoy with Directions to put into her all the Cannon and Ordnance Stores at <name>Fort Johnson</name> in
      North Carolina. I sent Orders likewise for the Tamer to call at Cape Fear, and proceed in
      Company with the Cruizer and the Transport to Boston.</P>
   <P>On the 25th the Scarborough, Canceaux armed Ship and Spinckes Tender anchored at Nantasket;
      Governor [John] Wentworth came in the Scarborough from his Government.</P>
   <P>On the 26th the Lively returned from convoying the <name>Charming Nancy</name> Transport over St Georges
      Bank, and his Majesty's <name>Sloop Hunter</name> arrived from England. By Captain [Thomas] Mackenzie I
      received their Lordship's Orders to take him under my Command.</P>
   <P>On the 27th the Savage Sloop arrived from New Providence, and the next day the Charlotte hired
      Sloop returned from carrying Dispatches along the Continent as low as <name>Charles Town</name>, and over
      to New Providence. By Captain [Hugh] Bromedge I received Letters from Lieutenant [William]
      Grant of the St <name>John Schooner</name>, who sailed from [New] Providence to Georgia the 22d May; from
      that time until his Departure in the middle of July for [New] Providence again, I find he has
      been pretty usefully employed at St Augustine and Savannah, And that having no opportunity of
      Conveyance to Boston, he had acquainted you with his proceedings by Letter dated <name>St John</name>,
      Cockspur Road June 19, 1775. Upon his Arrival at [New] Providence Captain Bromedge (in
      pursuance of my directions) sent him to Pensacola to bring back Governor [Mountfort] Browne.
      Lieut. Grants Letters contain very long Accounts of the People of Georgia's Proceedings in
      sending Delagates to the Congress, tumultuously assembling in the Cause of Liberty, threatning
      those who do not join them, and even vowing to destroy the St <name>John Schooner</name>. But we are so
      accustomed to this language that I will not trouble you with the relation of what Mr Grant
      experienced at Savannah. </P>
   <P>On the 28th I ordered the Lively to cruize from Piscatagua to the Isle of Shoals and Cape
      Anne; and the Savage from <name>Cape Ann</name> to Cape Cod in Boston Bay. The new Halifax Schooner arrived
      the 1st instant from Halifax, she is an exceeding commodious, fine Vessel with many good
      Qualities, but I find much too large for her low Complement, therefore at present I allow her
      Commander to bear ten Supernumeraries, for with less than forty men she cannot safely be
      navigated. I hope their Lordships will be pleased to increase her Establishment to that number
      of Men. Immediately on her Arrival I ordered Lieut. [John] <name>Dela Touche</name> to cruize in the Bay of
      Boston. On the third Instant some Transports arrived from Quebec with live Cattle and Forage
      for the Army; I received a Letter from Lieut. [William] Hunter acquainting me that being at
      Quebec to compleat his provisions, General Carleton had requested him to proceed up the River
      to assist the Kings Land forces against the Rebels, which he immediately complied with. I
      inclose a Copy of General Carletons Letter to Lieutenant Hunter. By a Vessel on the point of
      sailing from hence to Quebec I sent an Order to Lieut. Hunter to remain in the River and
      assist Governor Carleton to the utmost of his power, until he received further Orders. The
      Wind for several days blowing strong easterly prevented the Lively, Savage, and Halifax from
      getting out of Nantasket Road till Yesterday. </P>
   <P>When the Charlotte hired Sloop returned from [New] Providence I received Intelligence that a
      quantity of Gunpowder, many fine Cannon, Mortars, Howitzers, Shells, Shot, and other Ordnance
      Stores on the Island, would certainly be removed to the Continent if not secured. I therefore
      proposed to General Gage to send Transports to bring away the whole immediately; the General
      consented; Two Transports were ordered for this Service, I manned the F ale on from the
      Preston, ordered Captain [John] Linzee with the Transports on this Duty, and he sailed with
      the other Ships the 5th instant from Nantasket. </P>
   <P>The 4th I wrote a Letter to Rear Admiral Duff at Newfoundland generally informing him of the
      Situation of the Kings Affairs on this Continent, of the destruction of <name>Cape Anne</name> and Boston
      Lighthouse, that it was suspected Gunpowder, Arms, and Ammunition were smugled into North
      America from the Islands of St Peter and Miquelon, that the King's Squadron under my Command
      was in want of Seamen, and proposed to Mr Duff on his leaving the Station to send me as many
      young healthy Fishermen as he could, and part of his Marines. I sent this Letter by the Savage
      to Captain [Edward] <name>Le Cras</name> at Halifax with Directions either to send that Sloop or the
      Hinchinbrook with it to Newfoundland, which he should find fittest for that Service. </P>
   <P>Last Night the Nautilus anchored in Nantasket Road, and I received a Letter from Captain
      [John] Collins (a Copy of which is inclosed). Extremely concerned to find the Hope, with Major
      [Christopher] French and the Cloathing of the 22d Regiment had passed the Nautilus without
      farther Notice than common hailing;* tho' Captain Collins was stationed in the Delaware to
      strictly examine all Vessels he met with; And dissatisfied with him for leaving his Station
      without Orders, because the Rebels were making preparations and boasting they would attack the
      Kings Ships; for these reasons and apprehending bad consequences to his Majestys Service, if
      such Conduct passed without publick Reprehension, I have ordered Captain Collins to be
      forthwith tried at a Court Martial. </P>
   <P>The Scarborough came from Piscatagua principally with a Ship which arrived there from the
      Grenades, the Master of whom upon being questioned said he had Guns in the Hold; Captain
      Barkley detained him, but 1t appears that this Vessel was formerly his Majesty's Sloop Albany,
      upon her being sold to the Merchants was in 1771fitted out for a Privateer, afterwards turned
      into a Guineaman and her Guns put into the hold with the Shot, Carriages &amp;c, and where
      they are now said to remain. Captain Barkley has libelled this Ship in the Admiralty Court; in
      the mean time the Cargo shall be taken out and the Vessel searched. I am &amp;c. </P>

      Gentlemen who gave bond when due. It would be no particular service to me to receive money
      early than due than from the Circumstances 6£ time and the approaching inhospital Season, from
      these Considerations you will oblige me by as early and large a Remittance in Spanish milled
      Dollars by the first very good Conveyance if such offers before the Season is too far
      advanced, otherwise to remit in that way as the money becomes due. If possible give me also

      fortifications.</P>
   <P>Mr. [William] Bedlow, one of the commissioners, attending at the door, was called in and
      informed that it was the sense of this Committee to have a conference with the commissioners,
      and the engineer who is expected from Philadelphia, previous to the giving them any
      instructions.</P>
   <P>The Committee having sent for the persons belonging to and taken on board the North river
      sloop last Sunday [September 3], proceeded to their examination. After some time spent
      therein,</P>
   <P>Ordered, That they be taken back to jail, and there confined until further orders. </P>
   <P>Thursday 4 o'clock P.M. September 7th, 1775. </P>
   <P>Mr. <name>Isaac Sears</name> informed the committee that by an order from the General committee, he had
      been with several others in quest of Capt. Isaac L., Winn, who sailed in a sloop bound to the
      eastward, and suspected of a design of furnishing the army and navy with necessaries; that
      they overtook the said sloop above Hellgate, and that Capt. Winn requested to be examined by
      this Committee. Whereupon Mr. [<name>John Morin</name>] Scott and Mr. [Gilbert] Livingston were appointed
      to examine Capt. Winn, who reported that Capt. Winn had given them such sufficient
      satisfaction of his friendly disposition to the liberties of America, as induced them to
      believe the suspicions against him to be entirely groundless. </P>
   <P>Capt. Winn informed the Committee that a paragraph had appeared in Mr. Holt's. journal of this
      day, to his prejudice, and requested that a certificate be given to him certifying the sense
      of this Committee with respect to his conduct. </P>
   <P>Thereupon a certificate was prepared, read and approved of, and ordered to be signed by the

   <P>Whereas the necessities of the times have rendered it prudent to detain Captain <name>Isaac L. Winn</name>
      and his vessel for examination, and whereas an article has been inserted in Mr. Holt's
      New-York Journal of this day, that may be prejudicial to Captain Winn's reputation, it is
      hereby certified that, after full examination, this Committee is entirely satisfied that he
      still maintains his former well known friendly sentiments to the liberties of America; and
      that he is therefore fully and freely permitted to prosecute hu, intended voyage, without any
      interruption or molestation whatsoever; of which all the friends of America are requested to

   <P>New York, September 7.</P>
   <P>Friday Afternoon a Sloop with Dispatches from General Gage, lying near the Man of War, sent
      her Boat ashore with four Men and one Woman, who being observed by some of our People, they
      were all taken Prisoners and carried to the Guard House; the Woman was discharged, but the Men
      are detained for further Examination. The Boat was stove to Pieces on the Beach near
      Greenwich, and then burnt. </P>
   <P>Tuesday se'nnight a small Sloop came down the North River from a Place called Little Esopus,
      and anchored along side the Asia Man of War, in order 'tis supposed to supply that Ship with
      Necessaries: A strict Watch was kept on her from that Day until Sunday Morning, when she set
      Sail and stood up the River, attended by an armed Sloop and some Boats from the Asia, but she
      was immediately pursued by a Number of Boats from the City, and soon taken, with 12Men in her,
      who were committed to Gaol. </P>
   <P>Since our last several vessels with provisions &amp;c. have been stopped and detained by the
      man of war, who put his own price upon whatever he thought proper to take - on the other hand,
      several vessels which had been on board the man of war, have been seized by our people, the
      men examined; some were discharged and others confined, and the vessels destroyed. Twelve
      persons from one vessel were confined and still remain so. </P>
   <P>Yesterday afternoon, two sloops, Captains Holley and Hazard, from New Fields or Poquanock,
      loaded with grain, flour, provisions, and live stock, came, down the sound to this city, and
      having no clearance or other necessary papers to produce, were taken into custody on suspicion
      of being intended for Boston or to fall into the hands of the men of war. In their defence
      they said, that the committee of Fairfield knew of and did not disapprove their design; and
      that the reason of their want of clearance &amp;c. was that they could not obtain them in
      Connecticut, by reason of a an embargo there upon all vessels, and that they came to New York
      to clear out. </P>
   <P>The same Evening, Information was given by two Sailors, that the Sloop Hannah, Capt. [Isaac
      L.] Winn, lying here some Time, but not entered, lately from the West Indies, via
      Philadelphia, where it is said he was not allowed to enter, had just sailed with a West India

      many of which are irrecoverably gone. The Mercury ship of war is also aground, and it is
      thought will remain so for some time. One of the tenders, that was in the same predicament, is
      burnt by some of the people of Hampton, whom, we are told, have taken six of her men
      prisoners, among whom is the gunner. Master Squires, the magnanimous commander of this mighty

      and in the morning went in disguise to some negro's cabbin, from whom he borrowed a canoe, by
      which means he got off. We have intelligence likewise of a brig that was drove ashore on
      Curratuck, just beyond the Capes, which stove to pieces, when two passengers, and every hand

   <P>Dear Sir,</P>
   <P><name>St Teresa Sepr</name> 8th 1775.</P>
   <P>It is with inexpressible Regret we are under the Necessity of demanding a Party of Men from
      your Army to cut off the necessary Communication between <name>St Johns</name> &amp; Laprairie Chamblee
      &amp;c Your Manifesto came safe to Hand, &amp; dispatched them off to the different Parishes
      with all possible Care and Expedition. The Canadians are all Friends and a Spirit of Freedom
      seems to reign amongst them. Col [Ethan] Allen, Major [John] Brown, and myself set off this
      Morning with a Party of Canadians with Intention to go to your Army; but we having a Party of
      Indians waiting for us the same Side of the River, we thought it most prudent to retire, in
      order if possible, to raise a more considerable Party of Men. The Canadians, at any Rate, are
      determined not to take up Arms against you, but immediately upon the Arrival of a Party from
      your Army, I make no Doubt of joining you with a considerable Party of Canadians. Our Attempt
      in getting to your Army, and the Failure thereof, has deprived me of the Honour of seeing you
      for the present. We shall drop down the River Chamblee as far as my House, where a Number of
      Canadians are waiting for me, and expect a Party of your Men before they will stir. I shall
      notwithstanding keep up a Spirit of Faction amongst them, till I can hear what Advances you
      are making towards a general Attack upon <name>St Johns</name>. I had the pleasure of acquainting you in my
      former of the absolute Necessity of taking the armed Vessels at the Mouth of Sorrel River
      which will effectually prevent the Escape of the Troops of Chamblee &amp; Montreal going to
      Quebec. There are still Provisions and warlike Stores on Board said Vessels, and apprehend the
      taking the same to be of as much Consequence, as blocking up the Communication between
      Montreal &amp; <name>St Johns</name> &amp;c. They are but slenderly manned, and make no Doubt a Dozen of
      Men might take one of them without Bloodshed. I can easily furnish any Party you may send with
      what Provisions they may want. We wait with the utmost Impatience your Answer, till when I am
      with sincere Wishes for the Success of your Arms. Yours &amp;c </P>

   <P>Isle aux Noix September 8th 1775.</P>
   <P>General [Richard] Montgomery having received the enclosed Information on the 25h ult:, And
      being justly apprehensive, that the Enemy's armed Vessels might get into the Lake, unless an
      immediate Movement was made to this Place, resolved to proceed with what Force he could carry,
      of which he advised me by Express, which I received at Albany, where I was attending at the
      Indian Con£erence, on Sunday the 27 Ult. I arrived very much indisposed at Tionderoga on the
      30th And left it on the 31st, after having given the proper Orders for bringing up the
      Artillery &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c, on the 4th instant I joined General Montgomery at
      Isle-La-Motte, where he had arrived the preceeding Day, having been detained by Adverse Winds
      and rainy Weather, On that Day we moved on, and arrived at this Place, And agreeable to a
      Request that had been made us, we fired three Cannon to give Notice to the Canadians of our
      Arrival, who were to collect on the Occasion. On the fifth, I drew a Declaration (a Copy of
      which is enclosed) &amp; sent it amongst the Inhabitants, And as we judged, that going to St
      Johns weak as we were, (our Numbers not exceeding one Thousand) might have a good Effect on
      the Canadians and encourage them to join Us, we resolved upon the Measure, and accordingly
      landed our Provisions, Baggage &amp;ca and Early on the 6th embarked, and without any
      Obstruction proceeded towards <name>St Johns</name>. When we arrived in Sight of and at the Distance of
      about two Miles, the Enemy began a Fire from their Fortress, but without doing any Damage, we
      approached half a Mile nearer &amp; then landed without Opposition in a close deep Swamp,
      after being formed, we marched in the best Order we coud in Grounds marshy and covered with
      Woods, in Order to approach &amp; Reconnoitre the Fortresses. Major [Thomas] Hobby &amp;
      CapqMatthew] Mead of the Con: Forces being on the left and a little advanced, were attacked in
      crossing a Creek by a. Party of Indians, from whom they received a heavy Fire, but our Troops
      gallantly pressing on them, they soon gave Way &amp; left us - the Ground, in this Reencounter
      we lost a Serjeant, a Corporal and three Privates killed, one Missing and Eight wounded, three
      of whom are since dead. - Besides these Major Hobby was shot thro the Thigh, but not
      dangerously and <name>Capt Mead</name> received a slight wound thro' the Shoulder, as did Lieut [Bezaleel]
      Brown in the Hand, Our Surviving wounded are in a fair Way of Recovery; Night now coming on we
      drew our Men together, and cast up a small Intrenchment to def end Ourselves in Case of an
      Attack in the Night. -</P>
   <P>In the Evening, a Gentleman whose Name I am not at Liberty to commit to paper, came to me and
      gave me the following Account, - that there were no Regular Troops in Canada but the 26th
      Regiment, that all these, except fifty at Montreal, were at <name>St Johns</name> and Chamblee, that there
      were then at <name>St Johns</name> about one hundred Indians, that there was a considerable Body with Colo:
      [Guy] Johnson, that the Fortifications were compleat and strong and plentifully furnishd with
      Cannon, That The Vessel was launched &amp; had one Mast in &amp; the Other ready to raise;
      that she would be ready to sail in three or four Days and is to carry sixteen Guns, That he
      does not believe that our Army will be joined by one Canadian, that they wish to be neuter
      upon the Occasion, but if we should penetrate into Canada, it would not displease them
      provided their Persons and Properties were safe &amp; we paid them in Gold and Silver for what
      we had; That in the Situation we were in, he judged it would be imprudent to attack <name>St Johns</name>
      &amp; advised Us to send some Parties amongst the Inhabitants &amp; the Remainder of the Army
      to retire to the Isle aux Noix, from whence we might have an Intercourse with La Praire. -</P>
   <P>He told me that in the Afternoon's Engagement five Indians were killed &amp; four badly
      wounded, besides several Others, the Condition of whose Wounds he did not know, &amp; Capt
      Tyce of Johnstown, who was wounded in the Belly. </P>
   <P>On the 7th in the Morning (having been undistured thro' the Night excepting by a few Shells
      which did no. other Damage than slightly wounding Lt Mills) I called a Council of War of all
      the Field Officers present, to whom I communicated the Information I had received. -</P>
   <P>I inclose a Copy of their Opinion, which being perfectly consonant to my own, I immediately
      ordered the Troops to embark &amp; we retired to this Place without any Molestation, where we
      propose to secure Ourselves in the best Manner we can, so as to prevent the Enemy from going
      up the Lake &amp; also to enable us to take the Advantage of any Events, that niay happen in
      Canada, from whence I hope to hear in a Day or two from Col. [Ethan] Allen &amp; Major [John]
      Brown, who went to deliver my Declaration. -</P>
   <P>I cannot estimate the Obligations I lay under to General Montgomery, for the many important
      Services he has done &amp; daily does, in which he has had little Assistance from me, as I
      have not enjoyed a Moments Health since I left <name>Fort George</name> &amp; am now so low as not to be
      able to hold the Pen - Should we not be able to do any Thing decisively in Canada, I shall
      judge It best to move from this Place, which is a very wet &amp; unhealthy Part of the
      Country, unless I receive your Orders to the Contrary. -</P>
   <P>The Sloop we hear is in the River &amp; has on Board besides Provisions &amp; Other Stores,
      three Pieces of Field Artillery &amp; two Mortars &amp; we are joined by three hundred
      Connecticut Troops, &amp; four hundred Yorkers, so that we are about seventeen hundred strong,

   <Title><name>GEORGE WASHINGTON</name> TO THE MAJOR AND BRIGADIER GENERALS 1</Title>
   <P>Gentlemen:</P>
   <P>Camp at Cambridge, September 8, 1775.</P>
   <P>As I mean to call upon you in a day or two for your opinions upon a point of a very
      Interesting nature to the well being of the Continent in general, and this Colony in
      particular; I think it proper, indeed an incumbent duty on me previous to this meeting, to
      intimate to the end and design of it, that you may have time to consider the matter with that
      deliberation and attention which the Importance of it requires.</P>
   <P>It is to know whether, in your judgment, we cannot make a successful attack upon the Troops in
      Boston, by means of Boats, cooperated by an attempt upon their Lines at Roxbury. The success
      of such an Enterprize depends, I well know, upon the all wise disposer of Events, and is not
      within the reach of human wisdom to foretell the Issue; but, if the prospect is fair, the
      undertaking is justifiable under the following, among other reasons which might be
      assigned.</P>
   <P>The Season is now fast approaching when warm, and comfortable Barracks must be erected for the
      Security of the Troops, against the inclemency of the Winter; large and costly provision must
      be made in the article of Wood, for the Supply of the Army; and after all that can be done in
      this way, it is but too probable that Fences, Woods, Orchards, and even Houses themselves,
      will fall Sacrifices to the want of Fuel, before the end of the Winter. A very considerable
      difficulty, if not expence, must accrue on acct. of Cloathing for the Men now ingaged in the
      Service, and if they do not inlist again, this difficulty will be Increased to an almost
      insurmountable degree. Blankets I am inform'd are now much wanted, and not to be got, how then
      shall we be able to keep Soldiers to their duty, already impatient to get home, when they come
      to feel the Severity of Winter without proper Covering? If this Army should not Incline to
      engage for a longer term than the first of January, what then is to be the consequence, but
      that you must either be obliged to levy new Troops and thereby have two Setts (or partly so)
      in pay at the same time, or, by disbanding one set before you get the other, expose the
      Country to desolation, and the Cause perhaps to irretrievable Ruin. These things are not
      unknown to the Enemy, perhaps it is the very ground they are building on, if they are not
      waiting a reinforcement; and if they are waiting for succours, ought it not to give a Spur to
      the attempt? Our Powder (not much of which would be consumed in such an enterprize) without
      any certainty of Supply, is daily wasting. and to sum up the whole, in spite of every saving
      that can be made, the expence of supporting this Army will so far exceed any Idea that was
      form'd in Congress of it, that I do not know what will be the consequences. </P>
   <P>These among many other reasons which might be assigned, induce me to wish a speedy finish of
      the dispute; but, to avoid these evils we are not to loose sight of the difficulties, the
      hazard, and the loss that may accompany the attempt, nor, what will be the probable
      consequences of a failure. </P>
   <P>That every circumstance for and against this measure may be duely weighted, that there may be
      time for doing of it, and nothing of this Importance resolved on but after mature
      deliberation, I give this previous notice of the Intention of calling you together on Monday
      next, at Nine o'clock, at which time you are requested to attend at head Quarters. It is
      unnecessary I am perswaded, to recommend Secrecy, as the Success of the Enterprize, (if
      undertaken) must depend in a great measure upon the suddenness of the stroke. I am with the
      greatest esteem, etc. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>By Letters I have lately received from Governor [Patrick] Tonyon, he acquaints me, that he has
      great Apprehensions for the Safety of St Augustine, and therefore begs any Succur that can be
      given him, I have some Time ago Ordered three Companies of the 16th Regiment to him, and am
      told by General [James] Grant that a Small Vessel will secure the Harbour, a large Ship not
      being able to pass the Bar, and I hope you will be able to give this Assistance. The Rebels
      have Seized one Ship with Ammunition bound to St Augustine, and Governor Tonyon is under
      apprehensions of others expected there, both on the Account of Government and of the
      Merchants. 2</P>
   <P>I have certain Advices by two Deserters, that about 1500 Men have Marched from Cambridge which
      are said to be gone to Canada, and by way of Newberry, but by that Route they may be intended
      for <name>Nova Scotia</name>; 3 I should therefore think it exceedingly necessary some small Vessel should
      be immediately sent to Watch their motions, and to use every Effort to Surprise, some of the
      Rebel Small Vessels, which would be by much the best Method to get Intelligence, which if the
      Officer should think certain, he might give Notice to the Ships of War in the Bay of Funday,
      and Intelligence may be sent by Land from Annapolis [Royal] to Halifax -</P>

   <P>This will be handed to you by my brother Thomas who will show you two letters I have received
      from Guadeloupe relative to powder, and the steps I have taken to procure it. Capt. [William]
      P[ackwood] is now at Hispaniola, and Ships me about 3 tons which is landed, (say one ton here
      and two tons at Norwich Capt. [John] M[ackibbin] in a Brig, and Capt. [Elisha] Hinman in a
      Sloop sailed from here July for Martinico, and will purchase what they can.</P>
   <P>I have received from the Treasury £ 3645, the money sent out in these 3 vessels with what
      powder I have delivered is £ 5000. L.M. If its your minds that we shall make provision to get
      the powder our deceased friend laid a plan for, I must begin in time, its difficult to get
      hard money, the importance of the object, I think is such that we had much better gitt three
      times as much as we think we shall want rather than fall short. Our Towns are all Destitute
      almost, and success in our present undertaking depends on it. And I can truly say that nothing
      in my power has been omitted.</P>
   <P>I wrote my deceased friend E.P. the day we heard of the Battle of <name>Bunker Hill</name> that all the
      Interest I had of mine to lay out in powder, also all his own, and take up as much money on my
      credit as he could. His plan was good and by letter from my other friends they imagined he
      would succeed, For that reason he detained a vessel that I had sent him six weeks. His brother
      Josiah is a very promising young man, and I flatter myself we shall not be deceived. - have
      not to add only I think our armed vessells should be fitted as soon as possible. There is now
      two small Tenders at Montaug, not more than forty tons each, a few swivels, and about twenty

      the whole, ten in Number, made Sail, stretched across the Mouth of this Harbour, then bore
      away and went round the West End of Fisher's Island. About an Hour before they came to Sail
      they took a Sloop (Capt. M'Gibbon) bound out from this Harbour, with a Cargo of Horses,
      regularly cleared for Jamaica, whom they carried into Newport, where she still remains. 1 On
      Saturday one of the Men of War's Tenders got on Shagwagoneck Reef, when the Guns were taken
      out by another Tender, and she afterwards drifted on Plumb-Island. </P>
   <P>Last Wednesday Se'nnight a two Mast Boat, with a Number of young Men and Women in her, went
      from this Place !o Fisher's-Island, where they landed, and soon after a Tender came alongside
      of the Boat, when three of the Men who had been in her, returned on board, for the Protection

   <P>4. The ship Sidney, <name>Thomas Drysdale</name>, master, sailed from Baltimore December 22, 1774, with a
      cargo of wheat for Nice, in the kingdom of Sardinia. Just after clearing the Virginia Capes,
      she sprung a leak and put back into Norfolk harbor, where, in order to make repairs, it was
      necessary to remove part of her cargo. Drysdale had a dispute with the first mate, who left
      the ship. The captain's young brother-in-law, <name>Joshua Barney</name>, who, at fifteen years of age, was
      second mate, took over the post of first mate. A few days after the Sidney put out from
      Norfolk, Captain Drysdale fell ill, and died within a week. The command passed to Barney, who
      took the ship safely across the Atlantic, but a heavy gale as they were entering the
      Mediterranean so damaged the Sidney, that he was forced to put into Gibraltar. There he
      applied to Murray &amp; Son, and, after a survey, the ship was found to require extensive
      repairs. These took three months before the vessel was fit to proceed; the firm of Murray
      &amp; Son advancing £ 700 sterling for the work. Barney executed a Bottomry bond to that firm
      for the amount, reloaded his cargo of wheat and sailed for Nice. Letters from Gibraltar had
      advised Smith &amp; Sons that the cargo was in good shape when the Sidney left that port. Mary

   <P>It is reported, and generally believed, that Lord Dunmore is called home, with what view we
      have not yet learned, but probably it is to render an account of his sagacious and spirited
      conduct in Virginia; which can hardly fail to attract the admiration of lord North and the
      Butonian juncto, so as to have his eminent services recompensed with some higher department in
      the state, perhaps lord Dartmouth's. His lordship has this satisfaction upon his departure,
      that he will leave the colony with the universal consent of the inhabitants, of all ranks and
      denominations.</P>
   <P>It is reported at Norfolk, that the remainder of the troops which lord Dunmore expected from
      St. Augustine are taken and carried into Charlestown, a vessel having been fitted out from
      thence for the purpose.</P>
   <P>By a gentleman from London, who came passenger in the ship Baltimore, bound for Maryland, we
      learn, that a certain major <name>John Campbell</name>, son in law to mons. <name>St. Luke Le Corne</name>, who was the
      French superintendent of Indian affairs in Canada, sailed for Quebeck about the middle of May
      last, with 40,000 1. from government to disperse among the Canadian Indians, to induce them to
      fall upon the colonies; and he is to be this fall at Michillimachinack, and the Illinois, to
      meet the different tribes of Indians. 1</P>
   <P>Every day last week it rained more or less, and sometimes continued chief part of the night;
      but on saturday [September 2] it never ceased pouring down, and towards noon the wind began to
      rise, which increased soon afterwards to a mere hurricane, it blowing most furiously from the
      N .E. till near 10 o'clock at night. Infinite damage has been done to the crops of corn and
      tobacco, much wheat spoiled in barns, a great number of trees blown down, and almost every
      milldam in the country given way. - Capt. Robertson and capt. M'Cunn, both lying at York town,
      bound for London, and laden with tobacco, were drove ashore, and must unload before they can
      be got off; but the Prospect, Norwood, likewise for London, with tobacco, had the good fortune
      to ride out the storm, and has received no injury. At Norfolk, all the small craft were drove
      ashore, besides some ships, which have been chiefly got off, except the Mercury man of war,
      capt. [John] M'Cartney, who lies in two feet water only; and there may he stick fast, fast!
      Capt [Matthew] Squires, of the Otter sloop, going round to York in his tender, had very near
      perished in the storm, being cast away upon Back river, near Hampton; where his vessel was
      burnt by the people thereabouts, in return for his harbouring gentlemen's negroes, and
      suffering his sailors to steal poultry, hogs, &amp;c. Two of the crew were runaway slaves from
      col. <name>Wilson Miles Cary</name>'s quarters in King &amp; Queen, who were taken soon after they got
      ashore; and his pilot, a mulatto man, was the property of <name>Henry King</name>, esq; of Hampton, with
      whom, after skulking in the woods about 48 hours, he found means to paddle off in a canoe. </P>
   <P>From Hampton we learn, that they begin to receive melancholy accounts of the loss of lives,
      &amp;c. in the late storm. Mr. Roberts's vessel, of Portsmouth, was castaway, and every soul
      on board perished, except the master and a boy. Two ships from Ireland are likewise lost. . </P>
   <P>Lord Dunmore, we hear, keeps cruising about, and at the time of the storm was up in James
      river, on a reconnoitring party. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>As there is several Matters of Complaint turnd up (since my Capture of the Ship Unity) against
      the Capt of sd Ship, I think proper to acquaint you of the Particulars, viz as follows - On my
      sending of an Officer on Board Sd Ship, his Treatment was such as I would rather have expected
      from a polite Enemy than a Friend to our Cause as Americans - I would acquaint your Excellency
      in the next Place, that there is on Board said Ship a much greater Quantity of Naval Stores
      than is customary to export from our Ports - There is likewise as I understand some
      considerable Quantity of Provisions, much more (in my Opinion) than is necessary for Ship's
      Crew. I would likewise inform your Excellency that the Capt contrary to the Resolves of our
      General Assembly has taken on Board a Considerable Quantity of raw Fish. And from those, And
      many other Circumstances, I conclude that <name>Capt Flagg</name>, was designd for the Port of Boston
      instead of any one of the West India Isles - From this Consideration Sir, I (with the greatest
      Deference to your own Judgement) should think it proper, that the ship should be remov'd to
      Beverly, as a Place of much greater Security, than her present Port; the Lumber which she has
      on Board is considerable &amp; might be much easier remov'd to Head Quarters, for Service,
      from thence, than the present Port - I shall leave the Ship with the Committee of Safety,
      'till further Orders - With the greatest Respect, I am Sir, [&amp;c.] </P>

      the Circumstances relative to my takeing the Ship, your Excellency will be pleased to inquire

   <P>I am to acknowledge the Receipt of your Excellency's - Letter of the 6th instant, and to
      inform you that, Zealous to do every Thing in our Power to serve the common cause of America,
      the - Committee have determined, instead of the small armed Sloop, to send the large Vessel
      with Fifty Men upon the Bermuda Enterprise; with Orders to Capt. [Abraham] Whipple to cruize
      Ten Days off Sandy-Hook for the Packet expected from England; and if he is so fortunate as to
      meet her to put the Letters ashore at South-Hampton and send them by Express to your
      Excellency. - She will sail Wind and Weather permitting the Beginning of the Week.</P>
   <P>There is in this Town a Mr <name>Du Ville</name>, a Frenchman, who hath made several Voyages from this Port
      during the last Four or Five Years, and is esteemed a Person every Way well qualified, and to
      be depended upon, for the Execution of the Plan he proposes. He was with Capt. [John
      Burroughs] Hopkins the last Voyage when he imported the Ammunition &amp;c lately purchased of
      <name>Messrs Clark</name> &amp; Nightingale for the Army; and hath brought with him a Set of Papers to
      qualify a Brigt as a French Bottom. - His Scheme is to proceed to Bayonne in France, where he
      is well acquainted, and there take in a Load of Powder, which he says can be effected in Three
      Days. This Dispatch will be so great that intelligence of the Vessel cannot be sent to England
      timely enough for any Measures to be taken to intercept her upon her Return. - I think the
      Plan practicable and likely to be attended with Success. - We have here a Brig, a fast Sailer,
      and otherwise a suitable Vessel for the Voyage, which will bring about Eighty Tons: And we
      will undertake to fit One Quarter of her, and to supply the Money to purchase One Quarter Part
      of that Quantity of Powder; which is the most we can do here. </P>
   <P>I have written to Governor [Jonathan] Trumbull upon this Subject, and desired him, if the Plan
      meets with his Approbation, to dispatch a trusty Person to confer with you upon it, who can
      return through Providence and let me know the Result, so that we may immediately aquip the
      Vessel for the Voyage. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Intelligence being given me that the Assembly of Rhode Island had passed an Act for taking the
      Stock off the Islands with intent to prevent the Kings Forces from being Supplied, I wrote the
      inclosed Letter to the Town of Newport to prevent (if possible) their giving any Assistance.
      And as I was informed at the same time 250 Men were at Stonytown ready to embark to Block
      Island for that purpose - I got under way the 29th Ulto with His Majesty's Ship Rose, Tender
      md two Sloops whom I manned in Order to prevent them (leaving the Glasgow at Rhode Island) -
      About 7 o'Clock PM I saw a Sloop and Schooner off Block Island, gave Chace, lost them in the
      dark. Next Morning the 30th the Tenders Chaced these Vessels into Stonytown, the Tenders
      returned and acquainted me, the Town fired upon them. We stood in, the Tenders going ahead.
      One of the Tenders attempting to board a Vessel, a firing begun from the Town, the Tenders
      returned it, about this time we came to an Anchor off the South end of the Town - the Tender
      and the Town continuing the fire, About 10 Minutes after we were at an Anchor we received
      three or four Musket Shot from the Windmill, right abreast the Ship about 2 Cables and half
      distant, upon which I ordered one of our Guns to be fired into the Town, and waited some time
      expecting that would put a stop to it - They took no Notice but continued firing from all
      parts of the Town - Then we began and fired about 120 Shot during which time they sent off to
      me two Letters (which I send inclosed with my Answers) we took every Vessel that was afloat
      from the W arves, Consisting of a Schooner from Surinam loaded with Molasses and Sugar, a
      Schooner that was Employed carrying the Rebels over to Block Island to take the Stock, in this
      Vessel they left a Drum, two Firelocks and some Haversacks - a Schooner with Hay and two
      Sloops, they ceasing fire about an hour after we weighed and came further out in Company with
      the Vessels. At the beginning of this Action there was about 300 Rebels in the Town, at the
      latter end more than 3,000 Skulking behind Hills and Rocks and fences. All the Country about
      came in, We had three Men Wounded, can't learn what damage is done the Town. - New London and
      all the Coast is greatly alarmed and 500 Rebels were stop'd, that were under Orders for the
      Camp. On the 4th instant Arrived at Newport the Governor returned me the inclosed Answer from
      the Town to mine of the the 28th of August - it appears by this Town Meeting the late
      transactions have had such an effect as to almost destroy the Rebel faction, they passed a
      Vote to have nothing to do with the Continental Congress, and not to be concerned in taking
      away the Stock from the Islands in consequence of which upwards of 40 Rebel families have leit
      the Town. </P>
   <P>The 8th Arrived here the Swan from Convoying a Brigg clear of the Islands. We have just got an
      Account that one of the Schooners loaded with Hay we took at Stonytown and who parted from us

   <P>Will you do me the favour to contradict a paragraph in Mr. Holt's paper, in which he says that
      the man of war had stopped several vessels with provisions, and that we had set our own price
      upon whatsoever we chose to take? 2 The truth is, that we have not taken or bought any sort of
      provisions from any vessel, except three hundred oysters which I bought yesterday, and for
      which I gave the owner two shillings more than what he told me was the market price. The
      transport has, I believe, got a few fowls and ducks for their sea stock, not being able to
      procure any from the shore; but I am well assured, that whatever price was asked for them, was
      paid, and that the officer in the transport has receipts for whatever few things he has
      bought. I should not have taken notice of this, as I scarcely suppose any one who knows me
      would believe it; but I think it would be blame-worthy in any one not to contradict any such
      report, which, if credited, might serve to inflame. </P>

   <P>Septemr 9th 1775</P>
   <P>I have now wrote by every Vessel that I have heard was going to your port those going this day
      (the last upon which any can go to the West Indies) affords me the only Oppoys I may for a
      long time have of writing you - the resolutions of the Congress will be most sacredly kept,
      and shou'd any one offer to break thro' them, the popular Vengeance will be shewn in an
      exemplary manner - this I mention to convince you that no Island British or Foreign will from
      this day be supplied with any comodities of this Country, untill the present Controversy is
      ended. - I am to the last degree distressed at the prospect that presents itself at the
      present Crisis; it is perhaps as important as ever was agitated, and big with consequences
      that may involve a great Empire in the most inextricable difficulties. - the Suspension of
      Trade with every part of the World will be attended with the most terrible Effects, and Plunge
      thousands who once lived in Affluence into the most poignant distress, - this great City will
      sensibly feel it; and what to do with those who have always maintained themselves by their
      daily labour is very difficult to say - some Employments must be found out for them, but of
      what nature is yet to be determined on - Upon this very day have a whole Continent. shut up
      all their Trade and by this Step will Convince the World that they will Sacrafice everything
      in defence of the rights of Freemen - since the Creation of the World there has never been
      perhaps a more remarkable union in so large a Country and of so great a Number of People; by
      the lowest Calculations not less than three Millions - and is it to be supposed they will
      tamely surrender up their rights to any power on Earth believe me they will not, and whatever
      you may hear of disunion do not attend to it as there is not one in a thousand in this
      Continent but will stake his Life in the Contest. - We have good information that Genl
      Schuyler has before this time proceeded to the Reduction of <name>St. Johns</name> with 7000 Men - this is
      the Key of Canada and if he succeeds, the Way will be open to Montreal and the Reduction of
      all Canada must inevitably follow - Genl Carlton has an Army at <name>St Johns</name> and <name>Genl Schuyler</name> it
      [is] imagined will have a bloody piece of Work of it before it is accomplished - the Regulars
      have not above 1000 there but strongly fortifyed - we now daily look for Intelligence from
      that Quarter. - but as after this day no Vessells will go for your Island, you will not be
      acquainted with any of our proceedings - this is Saturday and on Monday we shall not have 10
      Sea Vessells in Port - the purchase of Flour, wheat &amp;ca. is now ceased and the Price is
      now down to nothing - the Country People offer it on any Terms even at 11/ or 12/. and
      everything else in proportion - Com 2/. wheat 4/ or 5/. but no purchasers appear. - Mr.
      Cuthbert carries this, going in Shield's old Brig consigned himself - Mr Morris's Brig is gone
      to Windward - Howell &amp; Douglass's Brig is supposed will be lost and the Cesar, Miller,
      will not get away for sometime being entirely unloaded at Reedy Island. - 2 I wish I cou'd
      inform you of some Vessells to your Address - but there is none - I am half Mad at the
      Circumstance and hardly dare to trust myself with Thinking on it - you must be as calm as
      possible as it will be to no purpose to fret - I preach philosophy to you but do not practice
      it myself. - I con£ ess it hurts me more than I can describe to see so many Vessells going out
      and none to your Shore. - I cannot help thinking rather hardly of two Houses here who have
      always flattered you with great support - I must think it cruel and especially at a time when
      there was so good a prospect of a Market. - I tremble at the Consequences of these Matters,
      but cannot paint my feelings so sensibly as you may easily conceive them to be on these most
      alarming occasions.</P>
   <P>Our Good Father now writes you also, the last perhaps that he may for a long time have an Oppo
      of writing you and informs you that we are all well.3 -</P>
   <P>there is only one matter that may possibly keep open some kind of a communication between your
      Island &amp; us, but it is a way that notwithstanding all its Risks will be adopted by some
      adventurous Spirits amongst us. - it is this the Congress well considerin,g-that every
      Incouragment ought to be given to the Importation of Powder into the Colonies has agreed that
      every Importer of that Article shall be allowed a profit of £ 4 P hundred weight and have the
      Liberty of Exporting the Value of any quantity thereof in the Produce of this Country to the
      Country or Island from whence he has brought it - this with all Risks will be attempted as the
      Encouragement is great and the prospect of a market to any of the Islands after a little time
      will be much greater. - this Intelligence you may Rely on - Jos. Whitall told me of it and I
      believe will make some bold attempts towards affecting it - I wish something of the kind cou'd
      be adopted by you in conjunction with some persons of capital in your Place. - Willin,g &amp;
      Morris in this Place wou'd be the best House to send it to here, as Mr. Rf obertl Morris is
      one of the foremost in the Cause and wou'd do everything in his power to Effect it - however
      it is worth thinking of - I am pressed for time as the Vessells will be going in a few Hours
      and I must send a Copy of this by Blowers Brig in case of Miscarriage - Adieu - My Love to
      Tommy &amp; Beleive me always Your most affe Brother</P>

   <P>Cou'd You but devise a Method of geting some Gun Powder sent here, You, or your Agent, shoud
      have liberty to carry off the Vallue in any of the Produce of these Colonies. - Therefore if
      you are disposed to Risque, and become Adventurers, And that you can command a clever handy
      fast Sailing Vessell to be employed in this Scheme - I shall Join you as £arr as five hundred
      Pounds. - A Good Correspondent, in some of the French or Spanish Setlements coud Mannage the
      purchase of such quantity of the Powder as might be ordered from time to time, and am
      confident, the Advantage derived from such schemes woud prove an Object of Attention. Because,
      in the first Place, a very handsome Price is already fixed on, to be given for the Article
      wanted here, to encourage Adventurer's, [&amp;] the State of your own wants in the Provision
      way, must determine what prospect of Advantage can be lookt for from the Return's - The
      success depends in a great Measure on the prudence &amp; Mannagement of the Master of the
      Vessell. If he is known on this Coast, or in our River in Particular. It will be only
      Necessary to keep clear of any Ships of War and how soon the Pilate can be got on Board, Let
      him request of the Pilate to carry him to the first place of Safety (as <name>Near Philada</name> as the
      Situation &amp; circumstan[ces] peculiare to his voyage will admit of.) And how soon he can
      get his Vessell to an Anchor, Let him go on Shore with the Pilate and apply to the Committee
      of any of the Provinces, or Countys, he can first meet, And upon giveing them information of
      his Cargo, they will immediately receive it on Accot of the Public, and give the Captain
      Receipt for the quantity delivered. - which Receipt he is to forward, or Bring to me, to
      enable me to get the Money - I wou'd not advise you to lose time in the Prosecution of this
      Plan shou'd you be disposed to Risque, At same time shoud you decline takeing any concern in
      this way - don't Make an improper use of this Part of my Correspondence. I beg your Sentiments
      however as soon as Possible for my government. - if it engages you[r] Attention, You might
      Possibley with prudence, Purchase or procure out of the Kings stores about a hundred (or 150.)
      Barrels, as if for some other scheme, And in a private Manner, dispatch some small Vessell
      immadiately therewith. - The returns coud be sent in a Larger, as soon as it came to hand. -
      Much Mannagement &amp; secressie is Necessary in the Execution of this business - That being
      the case, the Purchase should be Made in Smals (&amp; at certain Periods) to guard against
      every possible suspicion . . . I hope to have some liberty to Export in the Course of the
      Winter, and Shoud your situation encourage me, my attention shall in great Measure be governed
      by your return to this. - Wish however it suited you to adopt the Plan herein described, the
      Plan favouring of Mutual advantage, in case the Present contest shoud prove Lasting . . . I
      beg your Views may be conducted Privately and executed immadiatly after this gets to hand,
      Particularly if you shoud find it Practicable, to accomplish any of the purchase in your
      Island. - Posibley before the Ariveal of such Adventure as you may engage in, I may have it in
      my Power to cover your Interest &amp; my own, if timeous Notice should come to my hand. -
      Don't however depend on this, what you Risque, shoud not exceed, what you woud chuse to hazard
      &amp; Lose conveniently. Interest one half concern, but don't exceed [a] thousand or fifteen

   <Title>AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHARLES BIDDLE 1</Title>
   <P>[Philadelphia, September 9]</P>
   <P>Congress had declared that, if the British Acts of Parliament they complained of were not
      repealed by this day, they would not, after it, export anything whatever to Great Britain,
      Ireland, or the West Indies. It was a very fine day. The river covered with ships and the
      wharves crowded with inhabitants was a pleasant sight, if you could look at it without
      reflecting on the occasion that drove the country into the measure. Several of the vessels had
      arrived but a few days before, two or three only the day before. They were unloaded and loaded
      with great dispatch - they had as many hands as could work night and day. It would, perhaps,
      have been better policy in Congress to have prohibited any trade to Great Britain or her
      possessions. We should then have kept many a gallant seaman that sailed in this fleet and
      never returned to America; for many of the vessels were sold abroad, and the crews not being
      able to return were obliged to enter into foreign service? The trade should have been stopped,
      or the owners obliged to bring back the crews they sent out. I went to town, the day after the
      fleet sailed, on business; the wharf was clear of everything except a few melancholy looking
      people. </P>

   <P>This will be delivered to your Lordship by my particular Freind the Recd Mr [Jonathan]
      Boucher,2 whom I took the Liberty of mentioning in the most favourable Terms in my last -
      should that, by any Accident, which I scarcely apprehend, being in a very good Ship, never
      arrive, Mr Boucher, from having long been occasionally, a confidential Secretary to me, as
      well as from his own Knowledge of American Affairs in general and those of Virga &amp; Maryd

   <P>2. Extract from the Reminiscences of <name>Jonathan Boucher</name>, MdHS.: &quot;On the 10th September,
      1775, in company with Mr. Addison and his younger son, and a Mr. Braithwaite from Annapolis
      (attended also to the ship by my wife's younger brother and my sister) we left the Lodge,
      amidst the tears and cries of our slaves, and went on board a small schooner called the Nell
      Gwyn. Our accomodations here were but bad, and such, as I told my poor wife, as were, I
      feared, too ominous of the hardships she was about to encounter. She and I slept, I remember,
      on one .of the miserable bunkers in the miserable cabin, with a piece of an old sail for our
      coverlid, and a small bag of hominy for our pillow ... After a day and a night spent in this
      vessel we reached our destined ship, the Choptank frigate, then lying off Quantico. Here we
      stayed one day; and nothing material happened to us, save that here our two friends, Jack
      Addison and my sister, took their leave of us. At the mouth of the Potomac we stayed several
      days, and went often ashore, and were hospitably and genteely entertained by Mr. Wolstenholme.
      At length the wind came fair, and we sailed with a fine fresh breeze down the Chesapeak; and
      on the 20th of the month, just about sunset, in a charmingly fine evening, we lost sight of
      the capes of Virginia, never to see them more.&quot; </P>

   <P>In the heavy storm of wind and rain, which came on last Saturday [September 2], and continued
      most part of the night, the Mercury man of war was drove from her station abreast of the town
      of Norfolk, and stuck fast aground in shoal water; it is thought she will not be got off
      without a great deal of trouble. 1 The Otter's tender went ashore in the night, near Hampton;
      a number of the inhabitants boarded her next day, secured the rigging, guns, &amp;c. and then
      burnt the vessel. Six of the tender's men were made prisoners, but have since been released in
      consequence of some threats from the Governor. </P>

   <Title><name>GEORGE WASHINGTON</name> TO JOHN AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON1</Title>
   <P>Dear Brother:</P>
   <P>Camp at Cambridge, September 10, 1775.</P>
   <P>So little has happened since the date of my last, that I should scarce have given you the
      trouble of reading this Letter, did I not imagine that it might be some satisfaction to you to
      know that we are well and in no fear or dread of the Enemy. Being, in our own opinion at
      least, very securely Intrenched, and wishing for nothing more than to see the Enemy out of
      their strong holds, that the dispute may come to an Issue.</P>
   <P>The inactive state we lye in is exceedingly disagreeable, especially as we can see no end to
      it, having had no advices lately from Great Britain to form a judgment upon.</P>
   <P>In taking possession about a fortnight ago, of a Hill within point blank (Cannon) shott of the
      Enemy's Lines on <name>Charles Town</name> Neck we expected to bring on a general Action, especially as we
      had been threatened by reports from Boston several days before, that they (that is the Enemy)
      intended an Attack upon our Intrenchments, nothing, however, followed but a severe Cannonade
      for a day or two, and a Bombardment afterwards for the like time; which, however, did us no
      other damage, than to kill two or three men, and wound as many more. Both are now at an end,
      as they found that we disregarded their Fire and continued our Works 'till we had got them
      compleated. </P>
   <P>Unless the Ministerial Troops in Boston are waiting for reinforcements, I cannot devise what
      they are staying there after; and why (as they affect to despise the Americans,) they do not
      come forth, and put an end to the contest at once. They suffer greatly for want of fresh
      Provisions, notwithstanding they have pillaged several Islands of a good many Sheep and
      Cattle. They are also scarce of Fuel, maless, (according to the acct. of one of their
      Deserters,) they mean to pull down Houses for Firing. In short, they are, from all accts.
      suffering all the Inconveniences of a Siege. It is true, by having the entire Command of the
      Sea, and a powerful Navy; and moreover, as they are now beginning to take all Vessells
      indiscriminately, we cannot stop their Supplies through that Channel; but their Succours in
      this way hath not been so powerful as to enable them to give the Common Soldiers much fresh
      meat as yet. By an Acct. from Boston of the 4th Instt. the Cattle lately brought in there,
      sold at publick auction from Fifteen to £34.10 Sterg. apiece; and the Sheep from 30/ to 36/
      each; and that Fowls and every other Species cif Fresh Provisions went in proportion. The
      expence of this, one would think, must soon tire them were it not that they intend to fix all
      the Expence of this War upon the Colonies, if they can, I suppose we shall add. </P>
   <P>I am just sending off a Detachment of 1000 Men to Quebec, by the way of Kennebec River, to
      co-operate with General Schuyler who by this is, I expect, at or near <name>St. Johns</name>, on the North
      end of Lake Champlain; and may, for ou,ght I know have determined the Fate of his Army and
      that of Canada, as he left Crown point the 31st of last Month for the Isle-au-Noix, (within 12
      Miles of <name>St. Johns</name>, where Govr. Carleton's principal force lay.) If he should succeed there,
      he will soon after be in Montreal without opposition; and if the Detachment I am sending
      (though late in the season,) from hence should be able to get possession of Quebec, the
      Ministrys Plan, in respect to that Government will tum out finely. </P>

      fitted and armed, which may either serve to cover an Embarkation or take and destroy Vessels
      trading to the Bay of Fundy; And whereas it is requisite that the utmost Care should be taken
      to prevent Attempts upon any part of <name>Nova Scotia</name>: You are hereby required and directed,
      notwithstanding any former Orders, to remain in the Bay of Fundy for the protection of our
      Vessels trading there and for the Security of the Province of <name>Nova Scotia</name>; And you are for
      these purposes to cruize off Mechias and between Pasamaquody and Grand Menan And in the
      Passage, which ever you think the most likely place to intercept the Rebel Vessels, but you
      are at Liberty to proceed to Annapolis or Windsor, or to any other part of the Bay, as you
      shall see best for the King's Service. </P>
   <P>When you are in Want of Provisions you are to repair to Halifax, and having compleated return

      an Account of your Proceedings; And you are also to correspond with Captain <name>Le Cras</name> and obey
      all Orders he may send you for his Majesty's Service, unless superseded by mine. </P>

   <P>Whereas the Rebels have invaded his Majesty's Province of Canada, and taken the Kings Vessels
      on the Lakes; And his Excellency General Carleton hath required the Assistance of some of the
      Kings Squadron. </P>
   <P>You are hereby required and directed to proceed in his Majesty's Sloop under your Command
      without a Moments Loss of time to Quebec, and on your Arrival you are to acquaint his
      Excellency the Governor, or the Commander in Chief of the sd Province for the time being, that
      you are ready to co-operate with and assist his Excellency against the Rebels to the utmost of
      your power, which you are hereby strictly required to do on every occasion. And you are to
      proceed to Montreal, or to any other part up and down the River as shall be thought best for
      the Kings Service, endeavouring in all things to demonstrate your Zeal for it by an active and
      steady discharge of your Duty. And his Majesty's <name>Brig Gaspee</name> being also stationed in the River
      <name>St Lawrence</name> for the purpose of co-operating with his Majestys Land Forces against the Rebels,
      you are hereby required and directed to give Lieut. [William] Hunter such Orders for his
      Guidance as the Kings Service may require. </P>
   <P>You are both to remain stationed in the River <name>St Lawrence</name> for the purposes aforementioned

      the River and go to any other part of this Continent, you are to be sure to compleat your
      Provisions at Quebec to four Months of all Species or as much as you can conveniently stow. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 10 September 1775,</P>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Your Account of the Cannon being taken from the saluting Battery at New York, the death of one
      of your Boats Crew, and your firing upon the Town, gives me very great Concern. I cannot at
      present determine upon the propriety of your Conduct in this Affair, but must immediately
      advert to the probable consequences of it; And some of these will be the withholding Supplies
      of Provisions from the Kings Ships and using every secret and perhaps op[en] means to destroy
      or injure them. Should this be the case, I would have you acquaint the Mayor of New York for
      the Information of its Inhabitants that as his Majesty has been pleased to order a part of his
      Fleet to be stationed there for the protection of his dutiful and loyal Subjects and their
      property, and to support legal Authority, I hope they will take Care that it receives no
      insult, and that the proper persons be not hindered or molested in furnishing such Supplies of
      Provisions as shall be required for the Kings Ships as usual. If provisions are sent without
      further trouble I shall be happy; If on the contrary you find that by threats or persuasion,
      the Contractors Agent does not supply, and that pretences are formed to evade without giving a
      positive Denial; you are again to acquaint the Mayor that I do insist upon his Majesty's Ships
      receiving every Supply of Provisions they may want, paying for them at the customary
      reasonable Rates. And in Order to take away all pretences for refusing to furnish you with
      provisions, if the Contractors Agent does not serve the Navy, you are at liberty to contract
      with any other person or persons for that purpose on the usual terms, or at such a reasonable
      advance as these unfortunate times make absolutely necessary. And you are accordingly to draw
      Bills of Exchange on the Commissioners for victualling his Majesty's Navy for the amount of
      all such provisions as shall be so purchased and received on Board: It's being delivered on
      board in good Order to be the condition of payment. But if notwithstanding this moderation on
      your part they obstinately refuse to supply the Kings Ships, you are to send to the Mayor an
      Account of such Provisions as will then be necessary to compleat your proportion to four
      Months at whole allowance for your Complement, giving him Twenty four hours to return an
      Answer whether the Demand shall be complied with or not, and fix the third day for receiving
      the provisions and no longer. And you are also to inform him that if your requisition is not
      punctually attended to that at the expiration of the third day you will begin to fire upon the
      Town. Should Supplies be still withheld you are hereby required and directed to fire upon the
      House of that Traitor, [Isaac] Sears, which I am told stands very conspicuous, and beat it
      down, to convince the Inhabitants you will put your Threats into Execution. </P>
   <P>And it being uncertain what Effect this Proceeding may have upon the Inhabitants, you are to
      provide against the worst by shortening your mens allowance of Provisions and keeping your
      Ship in the best condition possible for Action, least the City of New York should prefer you
      as Enemies rather than friends and fellow Subjects; and in case they oppose, and endeavour by
      firing from the Shore or from Shipping to distress or annoy you, or preparations are
      discovered to be making for that purpose; You are to intreat them to desist, and upon a
      Refusal take the speediest and most effectual methods in your power for your own Safety. And
      at first these I think will be to burn or sink every Vessel of consequence near to or about
      the Town, to suffer none to pass up or down the River, and, if it is possible to distinguish
      the Houses of Rebels, from those well affected to Government, to destroy them. I sincerely
      hope there will be no necessity for such severe usage. I trust the Inhabitants of New York
      will no longer suffer a few wicked Men to usurp the Government of, and bring destruction upon,
      the City and its Inhabitants; but, let what will be the Event, his Majesty shall not be
      refused supplies where 'tis possible for his Fleet to command them. </P>
   <P>Supposing matters to be driven to Extremeties aforedescribed, your own discretion must govern
      your proceedings afterwards. Keep your Station as long as possible, as I shall send you
      another Ship soon, but should anything unforseen oblige you to leave the River you are to
      repair to Boston and either leave or not the smaller Ships on the Station as his Majesty's
      Service may be best promoted. I am &amp;c </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>(Copy)</P>
   <P>Boston 10th September 1775</P>
   <P><name>My Lord</name>, I have had the honor to receive your Lordships letter of the 22d August, and another
      without date by Mr [John] Connolly, and am sorry to find you are still in so disagreeable a
      Situation, and heartily wish it was in my Power to give you that assistance you want. Your
      Lordship is the best Judge, as to the probability you may have of raising Provincial Troops;
      should you have such athing in your Power, I don't doubt, Government will gladly defray your
      Expence: At present I can neither assist you with Men, Money, Arms or Ammunition, for I have
      them not to Spare; should you draw upon me I have not Cash to pay your Bills, and I have found
      it difficult to gather as much Money as would Pay the Subsistence of the Army, and that at a
      very great loss in Exchange. I daily expect Money from England, but no more than will defray
      the Subsistence, and Contingent expences of the Army, and very small Sums will in future be
      had for Bills here. </P>
   <P>The Detachment of the 14th Regiment is so formed and Employed here, that they can't at present
      be Spared, and if they could they would be to your Lordship but as Marines, as I understand
      from the Situation of affairs in Virginia, and from what Mr Connoly tells me that there is no
      probability of landing the Men, there being no Fort or Strong hold to throw themselves into,
      and having neither Cannon or Ammunition. As for the Remainder of the 14th Regiment at St
      Augustine, they will not be able to leave it, without they are Relieved by three Companies of
      the 16th Regiment, I have long since Ordered there from Pensacola, but I have as yet had no
      Answer to my letter. </P>
   <P>I would willingly send your Lordship a Transport, but at present there is scarce any
      unemployed, they are gon various ways in search of Subsistence for the Garrison, so that it is
      impossible now to spare one: I have had Applications from other Provinces Similar to your
      Lordships, but never have been able to Comply with them; as you have lately sent a Vessel
      home, and I suppose Represented your Situation: I hope you will soon from thence have the
      Assistance you want, and which, I am very sorry is not in my Power to give You, for I am not
      supplied in the manner your Lordship may Imagine. . . . </P>
   <P>The Troops with your Lordship are to be fed by the Contractors from St Augustine; and any
      person your Lordship may appoint for that purpose must draw on the Contractors for Pay, who
      will not Pay you may be assured, if the Ration amounts to more than is allowed by Government;
      In case of difficulties, and where no Provision is to be had we must do as well as we can, but
      I am not allowed to purchase a single Ration, no Commissary is now Employed to feed the
      Troops, they are only to see the Contracts put in Execution. I am [&amp;c.] </P>

      unless it appears probable to you that she is the Packet. - If you are so fortunate as to meet
      her you are to take all the Letters out of her, land them at South-Hampton and send them by
      Express to the Deputy Governor in this Town. - You are also to take out of her all the Arms
      Ammunition and warlike Stores she may have on board, and light Sails if you shall have
      Occasion for them for the said Sloop's Use, and then dismiss the said Packet to pursue her
      Voyage. - In Case she makes any Resistance you are to take her by Force. </P>
   <P>After taking the Packet, or the Expiration of the said Fourteen Days, you are immediately to
      proceed to the Island of Bermuda to possess yourself of a Quantity of Powder in a Magazine
      upon the said Island, and to take the same on board your said Sloop, and immediately return
      therewith. - In conducting this Enterprize every Thing is submitted to your Judgment &amp;
      Discretion with Respect to the most prudent Measures to be taken to become Masters of the
      Powder. We only recommend to you to effect it, if possible, without desiring any other
      Assistance from the Inhabitants than being piloted in and having a Guide to the Magazine; and
      of Course you will make no Use of General Washington's Address to the Inhabitants unless it be
      absolutely necessary. </P>

      Malbone was detained on board the Rose man of war till last Thursday, and his ship is still in
      her custody.</P>
   <P>The fore part of last week, one of the men of war's tenders having taken a sloop from the West
      Indies, bound to Connecticut, a number of boats boarded the sloop, up the sound, and carried
      her in to her right owner, with 7 or 8 of the tender's men. 1</P>
   <P>Last Friday [September 81the Swan sloop arrived here, from a cruize, and brought in several
      vessels, taken on the coast, in a legal trade.</P>
   <P>The same day sailed, for Ireland, the brig Britannia, Capt. Fare, and the next day sailed, for
      the same place, the sloop New-York Packet, Capt. <name>John Fryers</name>. </P>
   <P>The same day sailed, for London, the ship Francis, Capt. <name>John Buckley</name>; with whom went
      passengers Mr. <name>Richard Smith</name>, late of Boston, and family, Mr. <name>Francis Rotch</name> of Dartmouth, and

   <P>The same day sailed, for London, the snow Flora, Capt. <name>Thomas Forrester</name>, with whom went
      passengers Capt. <name>John Knowles</name>, Mr. <name>John Bell</name>, and Mr. <name>Gilbert Stuart</name>, of this town. </P>
   <P>All the above vessels, except the Britannia, were stopped by the men of war in this harbour,
      and are still detained contrary to acts of parliament. There are now upward of 20 sail of
      vessels, great and small, stopped by Capt. Wallace, and riding at anchor between Coaster's
      harbour and Brenton's-point. </P>
   <P>1. The Narrative of Captain Charles Bu1keley, for September 1775, covers this incident as
      follows: &quot;In September 1775 I was from the West Indies bound to New London in the
      Sloop--Capt. <name>Daniel Starr</name>. We were captured by a tender belonging to the <name>Rose Man</name> of War off
      Block Island, and soon after it became calm, and remained so all that day and night. Just at
      night a Block Island boat with two men and a boy came off and within hail and they were
      ordered to keep off. I then ran out on the squaresail boom and jumped over board and swam to
      the boat and then went ashore on Block Island and arrived there in the night and manned that
      boat and got another boat to assist us to recapture the Sloop. We went off and lay until
      daylight and after day broke we discovered the Sloop and retook her and brot her in to New
      London.&quot; The Bulkeley manuscript is in NLCHS. </P>

   <P>[Philadelphia] September 11th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Permit me Gentlemen, once more to trouble you since you have thoughts of encourageing my plan
      by Premiums, or by giving a bounty upon every ship which I should distroy in any of our
      Harbours, either by sinking or burning, &amp;c. Which bounty is to be twenty pounds upon every
      gun, which said Ship or Ships doth carry. And likewise, a further encouragement perhaps you
      will be willing to sertify (i.e.) If any Ship, or Ships, so sunk, should by any succeeding
      plan be rais'd &amp; maid fit for service, you will become obligated to give a generous price
      for the same, or any part thereof which might be serviceable to the Country, all which and in
      what particular manner you will become obligated to encourage me; please to certify at large;
      and when communicated, will be acknowledged as a favour by</P>
   <P>Your Humble Servant,</P>
   <P><name>Joseph Belton</name>.</P>
   <P>P.S; As you have a number of armed boats to give in charge to such men, as has commanded by
      sea, I would readily engage in one of those in the defence of our Country, in which (I think)
      I could make several experiments that might be of infinite service, provided (I saw) I could
      imbrace this engagement without depriveing myself of the liberty of prosecuting my
      preconcepted plan. And as I am a Stranger to you Gentlemen, my Character (as well as that of
      my family) may be well known from Govemour [Samuel] Ward, one of the Gentlemen Diligates from

   <P>I have received your Letters August 9, 12, &amp; 26, the first mentioning the Transports only,
      who, thro' your assistance brought the Army a comfortable Supply. The second accompanied the
      Rebel Letters; Those from [John] Adams and [Benjamin] Harrison no longer leave us a pretence
      to doubt the Intentions of this ungrateful people. I cannot sufficiently express how much I am
      pleased that we were so fortunate as to intercept them. </P>
   <P>The Brig Seaflower shall undergo the severest Scrutiny, but as the Court of Admiralty, with
      which and a Customhouse, we are yet plagued, takes Cognizance of Breaches of Acts of Trade
      only, what can be done, after she is cleared, but to detain her? which I shall certainly do
      and the Master also. </P>
   <P>The Hunter and Viper from England have brought A Parcel of Press Warrants, but I have accounts
      of some good Frigates coming out which may be daily expected. Provisions are also coming. I
      intend you shall have the Bolton armed Brig, and that the Swan shall come to Boston, therefore
      when the Swan sails leave but a months provisions in her, or as much as is necessary to bring
      her round without great Risque. </P>
   <P>The Store Ship so long expected is not yet arrived; We are in want of many kinds of Stores, as
      well as Slops, Beds and Paper, which is the reason you have not been furnished with what was
      demanded; however let me know all the wants of your little Squadron, and they shall be
      supplied as soon as it is in my power. </P>
   <P>Captain [David] Price has a Transport with him; the Bolton shall bring another; And, as for
      the first time, I appropriate them for the Fleet, I must desire you will fill them with Wood
      and Cattle, Sheep &amp;c. Take from the Rebels when and where you can; but we will pay for
      every thing we have from known friends to Government. </P>
   <P>The Squadron will be in want of Wood, can you command a Quantity? I am told many Vessels pass
      to Rhode Island laden, and that the Town now contains a great deal; it will give me much
      pleasure to find it so, for otherwise it is difficult to say where we shall get that necessary
      Article. But I must in confidence acquaint you that the Gen_eral and I intend next month to
      send you agreat many Transports, that, with some additional Force I shall also send, you may
      make a general Sweep from all the Islands, or wherever you can command, therefore I would not
      wish the loading the two Transports should prejudice what we meditate: Indeed I think with
      your usual management you may fill these for the Squadron without much noise; Send me what
      information you can of the Quantities of provisions and fuel you think we could procure by
      force or purchase this Winter, and whether Block Island or any other of the Islands can be so
      guarded all the Winter that our Stock may graze secure from the Rebels. </P>
   <P>It is said General [Charles] Lee is gone to Canada, some say to Halifax. By intercepted
      Letters (Copy of one I inclose) we find that 7000 men are gone to Canada, that the whole
      province, Indians and all, are against us, and that that whole Country will be in the Rebels
      possession by the end of April; so sanguine are their Expectations! All their Letters agree
      that no Vessel will sail from the Continent after the 10th instant, so that I suppose a great
      many have already sailed. We have brought in many outward bound with Lumber, Horses, Fish
      &amp;c. I will appoint some Vessel to cruize in the Sound the moment it is in my power. In the
      mean time attend to the information I send you of Vessels from abroad for Newbury Port and
      Dartmouth, which it seems are the favourite places for Vessels to push for. </P>
   <P>Captain Vandeput has had the misfortune to have one of his men shot, in alarming the Asia upon
      the Rebels stealing the Guns from the saluting Battery. And he fired from the Ship, not I
      think to any great effect. This I apprehend has produced on their part a prohibition of
      supplying his Majestys Ships. I will have them furnished where it is to be had and they can
      command it, and have accordingly sent Captain Vandeput Orders to that Effect; therefore if he
      sends for assistance, you are to give him all in your pawer. I am &amp;c </P>

   <P>Your Letter of the 27th of July, delivered to me this day, confirms my Opinion that we are
      risquing the Loss of all your Drawings, Plans, Instruments &amp;c, and perhaps the Liberty if
      not the Lives of all concerned by continuing to prosecute the business of the Survey you are
      employ'd on: I have therefore ordered Captain Vandeput to receive on board the Asia all your
      Instruments, Plans, Drawings, Charts &amp;c for their Security, in Order that the Publick may
      not lose the Benefit of your Labours purchased at so considerable an Expence.</P>
   <P>It is impossible for me to spare the Canceaux, But Captain Vandeput is ordered upon your
      Requisition to give you every Assistance he can in getting your things on board, &amp; also to
      receive such of the Gentlemen and People employed on the Survey as may prefer being secure in
      the Kings Ship to remaining among the Rebels. It is of very great consequence to send the
      abovemention'd Valuables immediately on board the Asia. You may assure yourself that Affairs
      are growing worse, and that hostilities will not continue to be carried so partially as at
      present. </P>
   <P>When all your Matters are safe on board the Asia they can be removed at Leizure; and I shall

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> Sepr 12, 1775.</P>
   <P>By Captain [David] Pryce of his Majesty's Sloop Viper, who arrived here the 6th instant from
      England, I have received their Lordships Order May 20, 1775, to send a Reinforcement of Ships
      and Vessels to Rear Admiral Duff upon his application, their Lordships Order June 20 Duplicate
      to take the Viper under my Command, your Letter June 24 on the subject of Press Warrants, with
      a List of such Captains and Commanders of his Majestys Ships and Vessels for whom Sixty seven
      Press Warrants are made out, and which number I have received, with four instructions, and
      some blank Press Warrants to be filled up and delivered as the Service may require; Your
      Letter the 24 inclosing an Act passed the last Session of Parliament, wherein a Clause of the
      6th of Queen Anne is repealed which forbid the impressing of Seamen in America; And a Copy of
      a Letter from Mr Grant the Contractor concerning the furnishing provisions to his Majesty's
      Squadron under my Command in North America. I beg leave in this place generally to say that
      the utmost Attention and Obedience shall he paid to all their Lordships Commands signified to
      me in the several Orders and Letters abovementioned and I will endeavour to reply as
      distinctly to each as possible. And first with regard to Press Warran[ts.] I flatter myself
      that although we have missed no opportunity of getting Seamen, yet they have been constantly
      taken with that Moderation, and the Officers have so studiously avoided distressing any legal
      Trade, that neither their Lordships or the Parties immediately concerned will ever be troubled
      on that head. I am exceedingly happy however in receiving their Lordships authority for
      manning the Fleet by pressing, and I am satisfied it will give no small pleasure to the
      Captains and Lieutenants to whom I shall distribute the Warrants as the Kings Service may
      require: Such of them as from death or Removals of the Officers they are directed to, are
      become null, I shall not fail to send home by the first opportunity of a Kings Ship. </P>
   <P>His Majesty's gracious intention to indulge the province of New York being entirely defeated
      by the Rebels taking possession of the City, overturning all legal Government, and compelling
      Adherence to the Designs of the Congress, will also prevent New York being a Rendezvous for
      his Majestys Fleet the ensuing Winter. I presume their Lordships are well informed that from
      the time the Ice begins to run until the River is again open in the Spring, and whether sooner
      or later depends wholely upon the Severity of the Winter, no Ship can lie in the River except
      a long side the wharf at New York .. As things now are I cannot think of putting his Majestys
      Ships in the power of Rebels, therefore the Asia must leave that place when the Winter begins,
      and come to Boston. But as the Navigation of this River and the Delaware are shut up only a
      few months, their Lordships may depend that Ships shall be ready to enter them the moment it
      is possible to anchor with Safety in the Stream; and that in the mean time preparations shall
      be made, and measures concerted if possible, to prevent the Rebels receiving Succours from the
      Southern Colonies by the passes of Hudsons River in the Spring. </P>
   <P>Neither of the four Frigates mentioned in your Letter are yet arrived; It is particularly
      unfortunate at this Juncture, for, expartation ceasing by order of Congress after the 10th
      instant, the Merchants have hurried out their Vessels from every part, and by good information
      I learn that no provisions are now shipped but in return for Powder. </P>
   <P>From every Intelligence I get, and from the known disposition of this ungrateful people, I
      have not the least Doubt of their resisting until an effectual exertion of our power compels
      them to be just and obedient. </P>
   <P>With this persuasion and having besides many reasons to apprehend an attempt to destroy
      Halifax Yard, and indeed overrun the whole province of <name>Nova Scotia</name>, on the 10th instant I
      ordered Captain <name>Le Cras</name> to remain at Halifax, and acquainted him that he should winter there
      for its greater Security, and to forward the Equipment of his Majesty's Ships. I need not
      mention how necessary such an active Officer is for this Service; In order to give weight to
      his Command I at the same time ordered him to wear a broad Pendant while he remained on that
      Service, hut to strike it when he left the Coast of <name>Nova Scotia</name>. I trust their Lordships will
      approve my placing on that Station an Officer of Captain <name>Le Cras</name>' Experience, so well
      acquainted with the Country and Climate; therefore I cannot think of sending the Somerset to
      England this Fall. </P>
   <P>Though the Boyne and Asia are by much too large for this Harbour, one at least must stay here
      this Winter. The Frigates and Sloops coming out are by no means sufficient to answer all the
      purposes of Government, several must immediately go to Savannah, South and North Carolina;
      Bermudas and [New] Providence should this Winter be kept in Order; a small Squadron must
      winter in the Bay of Fundy: Upon the whole, if the four Frigates and three Sloops you have
      mentioned are all that are to come to America, I cannot send home the large Ships. I shall
      moor them before the Town. One or two Frigates must lie in Nantasket; Sloops in other passes
      of this Harbour. Rhode Island and the Sound should be well guarded; the present force there is
      not sufficient by four Sail. </P>
   <P>At Boston the Boat Duty is extremely hard; it will continue so all the Winter. In the large
      Ships we have many resources: we should have been greatly distressed this Summer without the
      assistance of their men and Stores. I do assure you, Sir, we are every way more harrassed than
      if on an Enemy's Coast; but my patience is nearly exhausted, and I will not much longer suffer
      the Rebels with Impunity to insult and annoy us. I will now finish this Letter and reply to
      that part of yours respecting provisions in my next. I am &amp;c</P>

   <P>I am favoured by the receipt of yours of the 7th and 9th of August by Captain Montagu of the
      <name>Kings Fisher</name>. When I wrote to you on the 17th of July I really did not mean or wish that
      Captain Macartney should be brought to a Court Martial my only desire was that he might be
      removed or Superceeded in his Command here tho' I do acknowledge on my reexamining the first
      part of my Letter that such an inference might be drawn from it as I think will admit of the
      Construction you have put on it, and therefore am much obliged to you for the attention you
      have been so good as [to] pay to it, at the same time I am really sorry for the disagreeable
      Consequences it has drawn upon Captain Macartney who is I realy believe as you describe him a
      most exceeding diligent, punctual good Officer and perfectly well qualified to Command any of
      his Majesty's Ships, but I am now of the Opinion I was then, that tho' capable of Commanding a
      Single Ship, when he has only to obey Orders, that he is very unequal in these exceeding
      difficult times to Command his Majesty's Squadron here in a very extensive Colony like this
      and where there is a very Artful, Subtle set of people to deal with as perhaps any on the
      Continent, and I realy believe the inprudencies he has been guilty of proceeded more from a
      want of knowledge of Mankind than from any bad intention, this being the case I hope you will
      not only reinstate him in his Ship but also in your former good Opinion. Capt. Squire who now
      Commands here I have been much obliged to for every mark of attention and I make no doubt he
      will do as much as can be expected in this very extensive Colony for the good of His Majesty's
      Service with the very small force under his Command. </P>
   <P>I am much obliged to you for your good intention of reinforcing us here whenever it is in your
      power, I trust in God it may be soon for this unhappy Country is at present in a very
      deplorable State.</P>

   <P>A memorial from <name>James Stewart</name> and <name>Samuel Jackson</name>, owners of the ship Friendship, <name>Thomas Jann</name>,

      storm,2 she was driven on shoals and much damaged, and got into Hampton Road, with the loss of
      all her masts; and praying that the memorialists may be allowed to unload sd ship, and that
      after being refitted, she may take the said cargo on board, and proceed on her voyage.</P>
   <P>The Congress, taking into consideration the above memorial,</P>
   <P>Resolved, That the sd cargo be unloaded under the inspection of the committee of Norfolk, and
      that the said ship, being refitted, be allowed to take sd cargo on board again, and proceed on
      her voyage; and in case, on examination, the sd ship is condemned as unfit for sea, that the
      sd cargo be put on board some other vessel, under the inspection of the Committee.aforesaid

   <P>Marcushook, Sept. 13th, 1775.</P>
   <P>I expect the Province boats will shortly be finished &amp; their Station appointed. If it is
      to be above the Shiver de frees's, I apprehend they will be a partial defence, which ought not
      to be, as every person within the Limits of the Province is Intitled to a Provincial
      protection, the small as well as the great, which will not be the case with those below the
      station. With submission, every Frontier ought to be defended as long as possible, &amp; not
      an Inch of ground given up that can be defended. If the Frontier is defended, of Course the
      City is also; but the City may be defended &amp; the Frontier suffer. I am of opinion that the
      whole Fleet ought to be stationed at the Boundary of the Province, and then, if they are any
      Protection, every Person above them will Receive a Benefit. As to a Harbour, there is a large
      Island opposite, where they may be very safe, &amp; I believe that provisions may be had
      cheaper. If they are stationed at the Fort, Chester &amp; Marcushook may be Reduced to ashes
      before any Relief can be obtained, which would be a Considerable Loss, as all the Records
      &amp; other publick papers of the County is their. I think it is matter worthy of
      Consideration, &amp; should be obliged to you to mention it to the board. And as to the
      persons mentioned for officers here, I believe [John] Moulder &amp; [David] Ford would Answer
      the end, the first for Capt., the other for Lieuf't; but if the bord should think otherways, I
      shall be passive, as I have no friend to serve. I shall give you as true an Acc'tt of them as
      I am able, which is that they are sober men - men of Courage &amp; activity, both bred to the
      water, &amp; have both Commanded Shalloops. Ford is a very good seaman, &amp; he tells me he
      has been in two sea actions. Moulder has not been to sea, I believe, but is very well
      acquainted with the management of a Vessel, a man of Conduct, &amp; have both applyd for
      Births. I have nothing further to say Respecting them, and if persons may be had better
      Qualify'd for that service I will Readily agree, as it is the Public good that ought to be
      only attended to, and, as I observ'd before, I have not, nor desire to have, any friend to
      serve at the Publick ex pence. I remain Yours to serve, </P>

      and that no intelligence be given, but by his orders. When the officer, who shall be sent upon
      this service, is in possession of the fort, he is immediately to give notice to this Board,
      and wait for orders. Except only in case the man of war now lying in the Rebellion Road,
      should make an attempt to attack the fort, or proceed towards this town; when he is to do
      every thing in his power to prevent her progress. Captain Stone of James' Island, will order

   <P>And just as the Sloop was getting under Sail, the Mate of the Vessel, I suppose having been
      tampered with, refused to go. However I put a Negro of my own and another Negro on board, and
      the Captain put to Sea in the evening, with only three negroes with him.</P>
   <P>And some little time after, the Vessel got out of the Harbour, three Members of Assembly, and
      two of them were Delegates, mustering up any Common People, that they could readily meet with,
      to the Number of 16, or eighteen, went in a Boat, in pursuit of the vessel, in order to bring

      flour on board, notwithstanding they knew very well, that there was not any on board. As soon

      fire.</P>
   <P>The Boat with the 16 or 18 People, did not return 'till after 12 o'Clock at night, or one in
      the morning, and gave out, that they had been on board, but found no Grain, and therefore let
      the Vessel go, but some of them said, that there was some blows, with the Captain of the
      Sloop, and one of the Young f ellows, that went in the Boat; however I don['t] believe, that
      they got on board the Sloop, for it blew pretty fresh in Squals, and they Say, the Boat had
      like to have been lost. </P>
   <P>The Revd Mr Lyttleton was to have gone in the Vessel, but did not come to Town in time, until
      it was night, and the Signal had been made, for the Vessel to make Sail, that the Boat might
      not get up to Her. </P>
   <P>I sent Your Lordship intelligence as follows to be forwarded by General Gage, which I repeat,
      least any of my former letters, should be intercepted or that the Captain and my Negro in the
      Sloop, should have received any Damage, or the letters taken away by the People in the Boat. </P>
   <P>On Monday in the night of the 14 of August, when many members of Assembly were come to Town,
      agreeable to Adjournment the Powder Magazine was broke into on Top just to let a man down, and
      the powder Room door, most Violently and Audaciously forced open from the inside, at the great
      hazard and risque of the Magazine blowing up, and about one hundred Barrels of powder stole
      and carried off; and it may be Supposed put on board of a Vessel, Called the <name>Lady Catherine</name>,
      belonging to Virginia, bound to Philadelphia, or a Schooner Called the <name>Charles Town</name> and
      Savanna Packet,2 belonging to South Carolina, both these Vessels Sailed, from the west, end of
      these Islands, twenty miles or more from the Magazine, on Monday morning, but were seen on
      Tuesday morning, and pursued by the Custom House boat, which I ordered to be sent out, but she
      could not over take either of the Vessels, And it hath been Said, since that wicked affair was
      perpetrated, that the Country Whale boats towed the Vessels off. A large Reward was offered by
      Proclamation, as mentioned in my former letters, to any Person or Persons, that should make
      discovery &amp;c, and bring any off ender or off enders to Conviction. </P>
   <P>I hope the Admiral,3 will be able to Spare a frigat to come here and the General some of the
      Sick to Recruit, from the benefit of the Climate and other Conveniencys. </P>
   <P>Otherwise I dont know what they may do, to the destruction of Myself the Chief Justice the
      Captain, and the few friends to Government. I sent the Negro fisherman, as good a Pilot, as
      any belonging to Bermuda, for the Purpose of bringin in a vessel in case they should send me.4

   <P>By his Excellency <name>George Washington</name> Esquire, Commander in Chief of the Army of the United
      Colonies of North America.</P>
   <P>To Colonel <name>Benedict Arnold</name>. </P>
   <P>1. You are immediately on their March from Cambridge, to take the Command of the Detachment
      from the Continental Army against Quebeck &amp; use all possible Expedition, as the Winter
      Season is now advancing, and the Success of this Enterprize (under God) depends wholly upon
      the Spirit with which it is pushed, and the favorable Disposition of the Canadians and
      Indians. -</P>
   <P>2. When You come to Newbury Port you are to make all possible Enquiry what Men of War or
      Cruizers there may be on the Coast to which this Detachment may be ~xposed on their Voyage to
      Kennebeck River - and if You shall find that there is Danger of being intercepted You are not
      to proceed by Water, but by Land, taking Care on the one Hand not to be diverted by Light,
      &amp; vague Reports, and on the other not to expose the Troops rashly to a danger which by
      many Judicious Persons has been deemed very considerable</P>
   <P>3. You are by every Means in your Power, to endeavor to discover the Real Sentiments of the
      Canadians towards our Cause, &amp; particularly as to this Expedition, Ever bearing in Mind,
      that if they are averse to it, &amp; will not cooperate or at least willingly acquiesce it
      must fail of Success - In this Case You are by no Means to prosecute the Attempt, the Expence
      of the Expedition &amp; the Disappointment. are not to be put in Competition with the
      Dangerous Consequences which may ensue from irritating them against us, and detaching them
      from that Neutrality which they have adopted.</P>
   <P>4. In Order to cherish those favorable Sentiments to the American Cause, that they have
      manifested, You are as soon as You arrive in their Country to disperse a Number of the
      Addresses You will have with You, particularly in those Parts where your Rout shall lay, &amp;
      observe the strictest Discipline and good Order, by no Means suffering any Inhabitants to be
      abused or in any Manner injured, either in his Person or Property - punishing with Exemplary
      Severity every Person who shall transgress &amp; making ample Compensation to the Party
      injured. -</P>
   <P>5. You are to endeavour on the Other Hand to conciliate the Affections of those People and
      such Indians as You may meet with, by every Means in your Power, Convincing them that we come
      at the Request of many of their principal People, not as Robbers or to make War upon them, but
      as Friends and supporters of their Liberties as well as ours: And to give Efficacy to these
      Sentiments You must carefully inculcate upon the Officers and Soldiers under your Command that
      not only the Good of their Country &amp; their Honour but their Safety depends upon the
      Treatment of these People. </P>
   <P>6. Check every Idea, &amp; crush in its earliest Stage every Attempt to plunder, even those
      who are known to be Enemies to our Cause, it will create dreadful Apprehensions in our
      Friends, and when it is once begun none can tell where it will stop, I therefore again most
      expressly order that it be discouraged &amp; punished in every Instance, without
      Distinction.</P>
   <P>7. Whatever King's Stores You shall be so fortunate as to possess Yourself of, are to be
      secured for the Continental Use, agreeable to the Rules and Regulations of War published by
      the Honorable Congress, The Officers &amp; Men may be assured that any extraordinary Services
      performed by them will be suitably rewarded. -</P>
   <P>8. Spare neither Pains or Expence to gain all possible Intelligence on your March, to prevent
      Surprizes &amp; Accidents of every Kind - &amp; endeavour if possible to correspond with
      General [Philip] Schuyler so that You may act in Concert with him. This I think may be done by
      Means of the St. Francis Indians. -</P>
   <P>9. In Case of a Union with General Schuyler, or if he should be in Canada upon your Arrival
      there, You are by no Means to consider Yourself as upon a seperate &amp; independant Command,
      but are to put Yourself under him and follow his Directions - Upon this Occasion and all
      others I recommend most earnestly to avoid All Contention about Rank In such a Cause every
      Part is honorable, in which a Man can serve his Country. -</P>
   <P>10. If Lord Chatham's Son should be in Canada, &amp; in any Way fall in your Power, You are
      enjoined to treat him with all possible Deference and Respect. You cannot err in paying too
      much Honour to the Son of so Illustrious a Character &amp; so true a Friend to America.2 Any
      Other Prisoners who may fall into Your Hands, You will treat with as much Humanity &amp;
      Kindness as may be consistent with your own safety and the Public Interest. Be very particular
      in restraining not only Your own Troops but the Indians from all Acts of Cruelty and Insult
      which will disgrace the American Arms - and irritate our Fellow Subjects against Us. -</P>
   <P>11. You will be particularly careful to pay the full Value for all Provisions or other
      Accomodations, which the Canadians may provide for You on your March - By no Means press them
      or any of their Cattle into your Service, but amply compensate those who voluntarily assist
      You. For this Purpose You are provided with a Sum of Money in Specie, which You will use with
      as much Frugality and Oeconomy as Your Necessities and good Policy will admit keeping an Exact
      Account as possible of your Disbursements. -</P>
   <P>12. You are by every Opportunity to inform me of Your Progress, your Prospects &amp;
      Intelligence &amp;upon any Important Occurrence to dispatch an Express. -</P>
   <P>13. As the Season is now far advanced, You are to make all possible Dispatch, but if unforseen
      Difficulties should arise or if the Weather should become so severe as to render it Hazardous
      to proceed in Your own Judgment &amp; that of your Principal Officers (whom You are to
      consult) - In that Case You are to return; giving me as early Notice, as possible, that I may
      give You such Assistance as may be necessary -</P>
   <P>14. As the Contempt of the Religion of a Country by ridiculing any of its Ceremonies or
      affronting its Ministers or Votaries has ever been deeply resented; You are to be particularly
      careful to restrain every Officer &amp; Soldier from such Imprudence &amp; Folly &amp; to
      punish every Instance of It. - On the Other Hand as far as it lays in your Power You are to
      protect and support the Free Exercise of the Religion of the Country and the Undisturbed
      Enjoyment of the Rights of Conscious in religious Matters with Your utmost Influence &amp;
      Authority -</P>

   <P>The Flux that has raged so much amongst the Troops having required such Quantities of Rice to
      be consumed in the Hospitals, that we have but little remaining, and as it is an Article that
      will be greatly wanted, I should be very glad you would give Orders to the Officer Commanding
      the <name>St Lawrence</name> 2 (now going to St Augustine) to use every means he can to procure a Cargo of
      Rice, either at South Carolina or Georgia, or by any other means he may have in his Power, and
      to order it to this Port as soon as possible.</P>
   <P>General <name>Howe Complains</name> that the Sloop sent to Guard the M ystick was Suddenly removed, by
      which that Avenue is left exposed to the Rebels, and desires some Vessel may be sent

   <P>I would likewise inform you that I have Intelligence which I depend upon, of the Rebels
      fitting out Cruizers to Intercept our Supplys, and to Seize our Dispatches from Europe. They
      are Anxious to know what will be determined upon at home, and what Orders will be given in
      Consequence of the Events that have happened, as they mean to form their own Conduct
      accordingly. I hear of a Brig fitted at Middletown in Connecticut Just ready to Sail, quite
      new, and to carry Fourteen Guns.</P>
   <P>News is come from New-York of the making Prisoner of Governor [William] Tryon. I should
      imagine if the Ferrys between that City and New Jersey, as also Long Island, were narrowly
      watched that means could be fallen upon to seize many Rebels of Consequence, passing to and
      from the City. The Delegates from the Eastward might it's said have been Seized with ease as
      well as Washington and Lee.</P>

      to Bayonne, in which he informs me that the Council of the Colony of Connecticut are summoned
      to meet this Day to take the Scheme into Consideration. - This Sir is the Time to exert
      ourselves in sending to Europe for Powder, as the Vessels may perform their Voyages and return
      upon this Coast in the Winter, when the Enemy's 'Ships are unable to cruize. - I have written
      to our Delegates strongly recommending it to them to use their Influence that Measures may be
      taken to procure sufficient Quantities of that necessary Article. - I have also advised them
      to move in Congress for opening some Lead Mines immediately, as the depending upon a
      precarious Supply by sea when we have such Quantities in our own Country seems to me very
      preposterous. - And I believe the Article in this Way will cost us less Money than it can be
      imported for.</P>
   <P>Capt. [Abraham] Whipple sailed on Tuesday [September 12] with Sixty-one Men on board his

      her at all Events, to take out of her the Letters, Arms, Ammunition, and warlike Stores, and
      to_land the Letters at South-Hampton and forward them-immediately by Express. - After the
      taking of the Packet or the Expiration of that Time he is immediately to proceed to Bermuda
      and, if possible, take the Powder into Possession without any Communication with the
      Inhabitants. - I have given it to him strictly in Charge not to make any Use of your Address

   <P> . . . I am in perfect good health, which I pray God to continue, till I can give a good
      account of that rascal Carleton, and his bloody backs - I call them so, not so much for the
      colour of their cloth, as for their base and savage conduct in suffering the head of the brave
      Capt. [Remember] Baker, to be severed from his body and fixed upon a pole at <name>St. John</name>'s, where
      it now remains, as a monument of their savage tempers, and an incentive to us; bravely to
      revenge his death, or fall in the glorious attempt. </P>

   <P>New York, September 14.</P>
   <P>[Insert the Committee of Safety of New York's certificate of September 7 in behalf of Captain
      <name>Isaac L. Winn</name>]</P>
   <P>As by the manner of expression in the above certificate, it may possibly be thought by
      strangers to the transaction, that the article inserted by the Printer in his paper, was the
      ground of the suspicion raised against Capt. Winn, and occasioned the pursuit, detention and
      examination of him and his vessel; the Printer therefore, who thinks his Reputation of as much
      importance both publick and private, as Capt. Winn's, finds it necessary to inform the public,
      that the information against Capt. Winn, was given by one or two sailors who had belonged to
      the vessel, and the circumstance of his risking a vessel, loaded with a West India cargo, to
      Philadelphia, New York, and Newport, when she was bound to London, and especially when it was
      notorious, that the men of war in America, usually detained all the vessels they met with
      loaded with West India goods, gave credibility to the information, and strengthened the
      suspicion against Capt. Winn. Measures were taken to bring him and his vessel back, and they
      were actually in custody long before the Printer had published the article above refered to,
      which was a simple short account of the affair, as it was publickly reported at the time; and
      surely he could not be blameable for mentioning in his paper, a report which the Committee
      thought sufficiently credible to authorize their proceeding upon it; and as after examination
      it appeared to them, that Capt. Winn's character had received no blemish by the facts that had
      caused him to be suspected, neither could it be injured by mentioning those facts in a public
      paper. 1</P>
   <P>On Sunday last [September 10] his Majesty's ship the King-Fisher sailed for Virginia. </P>

      before you leave Barbadoes with all necessary information, that you may purchase the Salt at

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>A Fellow, Lempriere, is to be rewarded in [South] Carolina, with a large Ship, mounting
      several Guns, for an act of Piracy committed off this Bar, he is to be stationed to cruise off
      Saint Marys River, to intercept whatever Vessels are coming to this Province. 2</P>
   <P>No opportunity having offered before to convey to your Excellency an account of this audacious
      attempt, I beg now to trouble you with it.</P>
   <P>The 3d August in the afternoon, a Brig with Ordnance Stores, came off this Bar. The 4. the
      Provincial Vessel was sent to lighten the Brig, to bring as much powder out of her as she
      could stow. The Vessel returned the 5. with two hundred ninety three barrels of Gunpowder, the
      Brig being sufficiently lightened. The 6. being calm the Brig could not come into Port. The 7.
      in the morning at low water, a Sloop which was taken for a Negro Vessel, run on board the
      Brig, boarded with twenty six Men armed, took away a hundred and eleven barrels of the Kings
      powder, and some for the Merchants here. More powder would have been taken, but ten Soldiers
      were on board, as labourers without arms, to get the Ordnance stores out of the Brig: they
      grew angry, and began to plot, to seize some of the Pirates arms to drive them out of the
      Brig. The Pirates took the alarm, evacuated the Brig in confusion, leaving a part of their
      orders, signed <name>Henry Laurens</name>, and a draught on a Merchant, Mr. Broughton, in Charlestown for a
      thousand pounds Sterling, signed by the Commander <name>Clement Lempriere</name>, as they pretended in
      payment for the powder. </P>
   <P>The instant I heard of this villainy, the provincial Vessel was equiped, with eight pieces of
      small ordnance, an officer and 30 Privats of the 14. Regiment, and sailed in pursuit of the
      Pirates: they arrived off Savannah Bar, a few hours after the Pirate Sloop got over it, and
      went the inland passage to Beaufort in [South] Carolina, from which Place she had sailed. In
      consequence of the Protest made by the Master of the Brig, the inclosed proclamation was
      issued; 3 I have tryed to get it inserted in the Georgia and Carolina papers, but cannot get
      it done: if your Excellency thinks it proper for the Boston Newspaper, you can do as you
      please. Since Lemprier has been off here, we have heard of two armed Schooners cruising. . . . </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>In a letter to General Gage of the 19. July last, I mentioned the Savage Sloop, and <name>Saint John</name>
      Schooner, stationed on this Co~t, and the Island of Providence; that the <name>St John</name> has been here
      only once, the others not att all. They Harbour at [New] Providence, out of the way of action,
      in perfect quiet; when His Majesty's service, calls for their assistance in these Seas. </P>
   <P>When the <name>St John</name> was here, it was a critical hour, in the Province of Georgia. Lt [William]
      Grant the Commander shew'd me a note, he had received from Sir <name>James Wright</name>, requesting to see
      him before he sailed, or that he would return again to Savanah. I had dispatches of
      consequence for Sr <name>James Wright</name>, which I desired him to take, _advising him to return there,
      as the dissention, and disaffection were mounting to an extreme hight, between the
      Inhabitantnts in the interest of the Constitution, and the Rebelious. But, I requested of Mr
      Grant, to return to this Port, which he promised. My Object for it was, I had intelligence,
      that armed Cruisers, were out from [South] Carolina, to intercept, some Merchant Ships, coming
      to this Place, with Ordnance stores for His Majesty Garrison, and Powder for the Merchants. I
      intended on their appearance, the <name>St John</name> should go out out to protect them, untill the wind
      permitted. them to come into the Harbour. If Mr Grant had returned, an act of Piracy which
      happened off this Bar, would not have been committed. A relation of which I have wrote to his
      Excellency General Gage, 2 and beg leave to enclose to you an extract of it. I also wrote to
      General Gage, some intelligence I had procured, of Gunpowder being run, from the West India
      Islands, to the Province of [South] Carolina. </P>
   <P>A cruiser of considerable force, I am informed, is to be station.ed, from Saint Mary River,
      the north boundery of this Province, to intercept whatever vessels, may be bound to this
      Province, and is to be commanded by [Clement] Lempriere, she is now equiping in Carolina. </P>
   <P>The letters from England, for this Province by the last mail, I have had no account of, but I
      hear it has been wrote to some Gentlemen here, that they are put into the Man of War in
      Charlestown Harbour. I have no means to send for them, was I to send the Provincial Vessel,
      she can make no resistance, and would be taken by any of the Rebel cruisers. </P>
   <P>From [South] Carolina a rebel Packetboat is established, that sails under a flag with liberty
      wrote upon it, to Philadelphia, and another to Savanah. Our Coasts being intirely without
      defence, I thought you would be glad to have such information in maritim[e] affairs, as was in
      my powet; to give; at the same time I mean to draw your attention, to such services in these
      parts of His </P>
   <P>Majesty's Dominions, as may be thought requisit, when I shall rejoice most </P>
   <P>heartily, to have our Coasts cleared of such petty insignificant cruisers, which are able to
      do great mischief to defenceless Merchant Ships. I have the honour [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>The Delegates from Georgia informed the Congress, that when the convention of that Colony
      agreed to enter into the general continental association, they resolved, among other things,
      &quot;that if any vessels arrived from Gr Britain, between the sixth of July and the sixth of
      August, the goods imported should be stored and there remain until the Congress determined
      what should [be] done with them.&quot; That during that time two vessels had arrived with
      goods, which were accordingly stored; they therefore desired the determination of the Congress
      on that matter. </P>
   <P>The Congress taking this matter into consideration, </P>
   <P>Resolved, That it be recommended to the convention of Georgia, to cause thf: cargoes, which
      have arrived there from Great Britain or Ireland, between the sixth day of July and the sixth
      day of August, at the election of the proprietors, either to be sent back or sold at public
      auction; that out of the monies arising from such sales, the proprietors or shippers, be paid
      the prime cost of the said cargoes, anrl all charges attending the same, and the overplus be
      retained by the said convention, and by them be applied towards putting their province into a

   <P>Williamsburg, September 15. </P>
   <P>Last week capt. Squires sent the following impertinent letter, by a servant of lord Dunmore's,
      to the printer of the Norfolk gazette. </P>
   <P>[Here is inserted Captain Squire's letter of September 9, 1775] </P>
   <P>And on the day after the disaster which happened to his tender, which was chiefly manned with
      runaway negroes, he despatched the following letter to the committee of the town of Hampton, </P>
   <P>[Here is inserted Captain Squire's letter of September 10, 1775] </P>
   <P>The Hampton committee having thought proper, on monday last [September 11], to lay the above
      letter before the committee of this city, they represented to the commanding-officer of the
      volunteers here the necessity of sending down a sufficient force to protect the inhabitants of
      Hampton from any insult that might be offered to them by capt. Squire, who immediately
      communicated the same to the volunteers, when 100 men offered themselves, and next morning set
      out on their march to Hampton; where it is to be hoped, should the said Squire attempt any
      thing hostile against the people there, that they will be able to give a good account of him.
      And as to his rer1uisition of the king's stores, &amp;c. that were on board the tender, being
      delivered up to him, it will be time enough to settle accounts with him after he has made
      satisfaction to the owners of the several slaves he has harboured (some of whom he now employs
      in the king's service) as well as for the number of robberies he has suffered to be committed,
      in hogs and poultry, from sundry plantations. </P>
   <Title>Purdie's <name>Virginia Gazette</name>, SUPPLEMENT, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1775 </Title>
   <P>Williamsburg, September 15.</P>
   <P>A few days ago the Kingfisher sloop, capt. Montague; arrived at Norfolk, with lieutenant
      Graham [<name>Alexander Graeme</name>] on board, to take the command of his majesty's ship Mercury, capt.
      M'Cartney being put under arrest (for disobedience of orders, it is said) and is to be sent to
      Boston, to be tried by a courtmartial.</P>
   <P>Lord Dunmore has received another reinforcement from St. Augustine, of no less than between 20
      and 30 effective men, and soon expects to have his army augmented to 500; with which, we hear,
      he intends taking possession of his palace in this city, that he lately abandoned - if not
      prevented by those he terms rebels.</P>
   <P>From Hampton we learn, that capt. Squire has fallen down to Hampton road, where he now lies,
      and has seized three passage-boats, with the negroes in them, by way of reprisal, he says, for
      the stores &amp;c. taken out of his tender, when drove ashore in the late storm; which boats
      and negroes, it is likely, he intends taking into the king's service, to send out a-pirating
      for hogs, fowls, &amp;c. - A very pretty occupation for the captain of one of his majesty's
      ships of war! </P>
   <Title>&quot;WILLIAMSBURG, (VIRGINIA) SEPTEMBER 15&quot; 1 </Title>
   <P><name>John Macartney</name> Esq; late of his Majesty's ship Mercury, we are informed, is robbed of his
      commission by Lord Dunmore, because he would not agree in all his Lordship's measures. We
      understand that this amiable gentleman is to be sent to Boston, there to take his trial before
      a courtmartial - for what? Because probably, he would not consent to be a sheep stealer, or a
      slave to those creatures of infamy, who pursue nothing but the destruction of this unhappy
      country.</P>

   <P>[Charleston, September 15]</P>
   <P> . . . about an hour after we set sail [from Gadsden's wharf] we crossed the harbour &amp;
      came to an Anchor near the opposite shore not far from Captain Stones landing, it was with
      much difficulty that we disembarked, as we had but two small boats we could not land above
      fifteen men at a time, the Vessel being near half a Mile from the Shore &amp; a long muddy
      flat, over which we partly draggd the boats, &amp; then waded through the Water up to our
      Middless, this misfortune we attributed to the fear of the Captain who dreaded the consequence
      of being ha used down by the tide under the Cannon of <name>Fort Johnson</name>, which he apprehended was
      in the enemies hands, when One half a Mile more eastward would have given us a safe &amp; good
      landing, without being commanded by the much dreaded Cannon of the Fort or the Tamar Man of
      War. Being arrived as I said before within half a Mile of the Shore Capt: Pinckneys Granadiers
      were orderd first to land &amp; possess themselves of the sea beach, to cover us in case any
      foes should offer to Oppose our landing, as soon as his company was landed Captain Elliotts
      Granadiers, embarked from on board the Vessel in the small boats, Col: [Isaac] Motte landed in
      One &amp; Captain Elliott in the other, by this time the day began to dawn, Col. Motte called
      Captains Pinckney &amp; Elliott &amp; consulted with them whether it would be best to make an
      attempt upon the Fort before day with the troops that were landed, or to waite till the rest
      of the Granadiers &amp; Marians Light Infantry should land, they advised that an assault
      should be immediately made, &amp; that Capt: Marion should be order'd to march up with his
      Company, &amp; Lieut: Shubrick with the Granadiers not yet landed, as soon as possible to
      their assistance, this being agreed on the following regulation was orderd. vizt - Lieutent
      Mouat with a Detachment of the Granadiers of the first Regiment, &amp; the Cadets was order'd
      to scale the Wall of the South face of the South West Bastion, which having a Ladder already
      fixed to it might be perform'd without much difficulty, this detachmt accordingly march'd off
      to perform their orders. Col: Motte with the remaining Granadiers, commanded by <name>Capt Pinckney</name>
      followed the first detachmt &amp; Capt. Elliott brought up the rear, when the troops came
      within half a Mile of the fort they took their separate routs, in Order to invest the fort on
      three sides at Once, the other side being washed by the Sea could not be attempted but by
      Boats, which was thought unnecessary. When Lieut: Mouatt came up to the Glaces he found the
      Gates open, and rushed in with his detachmt &amp; took possession of the Garrison making
      prisoners of all he found within. Col: Motte with the Granadiers under Capt: Pinckney soon
      after enter'd the Gate taking possession of the Fort while Capt: Elliott with a detachment of
      his Granadiers scaled the Walls of the <name>Barbet Battery</name>, &amp; took possession of it, he found
      all the Cannon, consisting of Seven twenty Six pounders, Twelve Eighteen pounders, One Twelve
      pounder and One Nine pounder, dismounted &amp; thrown off the Platform, so that they were
      renderd useless for immediate service, but upon examining the touch holes found they were not
      spiked, this he informed Col: Motte of immediately, who at this time had the commander of the
      Fort before him to deliver up the Keys of the Magazine &amp; Gates of the Fort, the Col:
      desired to be informed by him who had done this Mischief, he reply'd that the Men of Wars Men
      under the direction of the Governors Secretary, Capt. [Alexander] Innes had left the fort two
      hours ago, that they had enterd his room, made him a prisoner and he supposed they had done
      it, he then gave up the keys, Col: Motte committed him &amp; the rest of the Garrison to
      Prison, &amp; placed Gentries, at the Gate of the Ravelin, the Inner Gate, on the <name>Salient Iles</name>
      of the Bastions, on the lower Battery, &amp; at the Magazine, &amp; kept a Captains Guard
      Mounted, which was relieved every 24 hours, the Relief were, for the Sentries every 2 hours.
      Not having any Engines to mount the heavy cannon, nothing could be done that day. Col: Motte
      dispatched Lieut: Shubrick off to the Council of Safety with an Account of his Expedition. </P>

      so in preference to being looked in the Face by Gentlemen whom he has deceived &amp; by whom
      he has been so clearly detected be that as it may we judged it proper to Send a party of Men

      before day light this Morning &amp; the Garrison consisting of the impudent Gunner Walker

      &amp; I suppose will acquaint you with our late Transactions - <name>Fort Johnson</name> is in our hands,
      &amp; garrisoned with 150 men, which will be re'inforc'd this night. I wrote out a curious
      dialogue which Laurens will inclose you, it was the production of a Trick plaid upon our
      Solomon. Your friend K[irkland] is actually on board the Tamar, I yesterday moved that the
      Gov. by whose Assistance he escaped, should be taken into Custody &amp; offered in Exchange
      for K. but could not carry the point, it is not however improbable that he may yet be nab'd,
      if he does not take care of himself.</P>
   <P>Three Schooners are to be armed for the defence of our Trade, &amp;c. and this is only a
      beginning to our Marine, &amp; I do not despair of our getting Batteries, &amp; very soon
      provided you will come &amp; give us a little Assistance; so the Tamar must be upon her good
      Behaviour - I do not write you explicitly but wish to awaken your Curiosity &amp; make you
      hasten your Business &amp; hurry down to lend us a hand</P>
   <P>[Alexander] Innes has followed his sword on board the man of war, &amp; [William] Wragg has
      actually taken Physick at his Country retreat. I am told [Dr. Alexander] Garden made him up
      plenty of Febrifuge - Some of our Thunderers marched to the Bastions this day, &amp; more will
      move off Tomorrow, so that we may have one or, two Batterys compleat in a day or two in a word

   <P>On Sunday the ninth [sic 10th] we again set out, and about Ten in the Evening arrived at the
      Place where we tarried the Night when we were up before; and then setting out to march to
      Chambli, just as we came to the Breast Work that we before had thrown up, we received a very
      heavy Fire from two Batteaus that were on the Lake, with Swivel and Grape Shot, and at the
      same Time from the Savages on the Shore: Our armed Boats perceiving the Fire on the Lake,
      fired three Twelve Pounders, one of which took the Enemy's principal Batteau directly in the
      Bow, and tore her from Stem to Stern: She immediately sunk, with all the Men in her, amounting
      to 35. We then proceeded on to the Breast Work, where we killed their chief Interpreter and
      one Indian. We received no Hurt at all. In the Morning we saw their armed Schooner of 180
      Tons, carrying twelve Nine Pounders, coming towards us; we then thought it expedient to return
      to the Island, until we could have more Artillery with us, which we now have got, with a great
      Number of Bomb Shells, Mortars, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. We are now immediately to embark a
      third Time, and are determined to take the Schooner and the Fort at all Events. </P>

   <Title>MINUTES OF THE PENNSYLVANIA COMMITTEE OF SAFETY 1</Title>
   <P>[Philadelphia], September 16th.</P>
   <P>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee, That all Pilots of the Bay and River
      Delaware, ought to use their utmost endeavours to avoid going or being taken on Board British
      ships of war or armed vessels, during the present struggle for Liberty. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee, that all Pilots of the Bay and River
      Delaware, ought to lay up their Boats on or before the 20th day of September inst., and
      cautiously avoid going on any navigable water or other place on Land or Water, where they may
      probably fall within the Power of British Men of War, armed Vessells or Boats,../ or within
      the Power of Men landed from such. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That any Pilot or other person who shall conduct or bring any British Man of war,
      Armed Vessell, Boat or other Craft, up the Bay of Delaware, shall, on being released from that
      service, forthwith repair to this Committee, there to prove by such means as may be in his
      power, that he was compelled by force into that service, and such pilot or other person not
      appearing to this Board within five days after his first Landing, unless put on shoar at too
      great a distance, shall be considered as having Voluntarily performed the said service. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That any pilot, or other person acting as a Pilot, in Delaware Bay &amp; River, who
      shall refuse or neglect to lay up his Boat or Craft, or who shall put himself in the way of
      being forcibly taken on board the King's Ships, or who shall voluntarily serve, or offer to
      serve or instruct them in the navigation of the said Bay and River, shall on proof thereof
      made to this Board, be deemed an Enemy to American Liberty, a Traytor to his Country, and as
      such published and held forth to the Public. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee, that the Pilots of the Bay and River
      Delaware should remain on shore at Cape Henlopen or Cape May, until such Merchants Vessells as
      arrive send their Boats on shore for a Pilot, when one may repair on Board, provided there is
      not any Man of War in sight, or in the said Bay and River, but if there is, the Captains of
      such Merchantman must do the best they can for the safety of their Ships, as no Pilots must go
      on Board in such case. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee that the owners of such Ships as are
      brought up during the time these resolves remain in force, ought to allow such reasonable
      additional Pilotage as the Board of Wardens may fix, towards bearing the Pilots expence down
      to the Cape by Land. </P>
   <P>F. Resolved, That it is necessary for this Board to be contantly and early informed when any
      Men of-War, armed Vessells, Boats or Crafts arrive at the Capes of Delaware; and therefore,
      That Mr. <name>Henry Fisher</name>, of Lewis Town, be appointed on this service, for which a Reasonable
      Reward, proportioned to his trouble, loss of time, and actual expences, shall hereafter be
      allowed him. And that the following be his instructions: </P>
   <P>Instructions from the Committee of Safety at Philadelphia, to Mr. <name>Henry Fisher</name> at Lewis Town. </P>

      herewith, an order from the Board of Wardens to the keeper of the Light House, directing him
      to make such signals by Day and Night, on discovering any Ship or Vessell standing in for the
      Land as you and he may agree on, and you must immediately repair to the properest place for
      discovering what they are, and when you are convinced of the arrival of one or more Men of-War
      intending up this River, you are to send us advice thereof, either by Land or Water, as you
      conceive best, mentioning the number of the Enemy Ships; and their force and manner of
      proceeding, as nearly as you can ascertain these circumstances; when you send intelligence by
      water, you should avoid sending Pilots, or persons that can serve as Pilots to the Enemy, lest
      they fall within their power. </P>
   <P>F. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee, that the Buoys in the Bay of Delaware
      ought to be taken up immediately, and that the Wardens of the Port be desired to give orders
      for its being done, and to give orders to the keeper of the light to make such Signals by Day
      or night, as Mr. <name>Henry Fisher</name> and he may agree on, upon seeing Vessells Standing inwards. </P>

      be wanted for especial or particular purposes, during the time these Resolves remain in Force,

      taking up the Buoys, agreeable to the preceding Resolutions. Resolved, That Mr. <name>Samuel Morris</name>
      and Mr. <name>Robert White</name>, furnish an Estimate of the Cost of the Boats and <name>Chevaux de Frize</name>. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That Mr. <name>Robert Morris</name> and Mr. Tho's Wharton furnish an Estimate of the cost of
      Powder, Saltpetre, Fire Arms, &amp;ca., that they have purchased and sent for. </P>

   <P>In our last we mentioned the burning of a man of war's tender near Hampton, and other
      circumstances relative to the affair, but find the account is erroneous, and that we were
      misinformed. The vessel was the property of Captain [Henry] Collins, and the men belonging to
      the Magdalen. Captain Squires and some of his people were on board at the time the vessel
      reached the shore, but all left her except the gunner, the pilot and a private man, who took
      to their boat next day, and carried every thing they wanted, except the guns, the vessel's
      tackle, and furniture, which they gave to one Fin, near whose house she was. None of the men
      were molested, but treated with much civility. Ruth, the pilot, an American, was only secured
      as a witness against several notorious sheep-stealers. </P>
   <Title>COMMITTEE OF ELIZABETH CITY COUNTY, AND THE TOWN OF HAMPTON TO CAPTAIN MATTHEW
      SQUIRE1</Title>
   <P>To <name>Matthew Squire</name>, esq; commander of his majesty's ship Otter, lying in Hampton road. </P>
   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Hampton, September 16, 1775.</P>
   <P>Yours of the 10th instant, directed to the committee of the town of Hampton, reciting,
      &quot;that a sloop tender on his majesty's service was on the 2d instant cast on shore near
      this place, having on board some of the king's stores, which you say were seized by the
      inhabitants, and demanding an immediate return of the same, or. that the people of Hampton
      must answer the consequences of such outrage,&quot; was this day laid before them, who,
      knowing the above recital to be injurious and untrue, think proper here to mention the facts
      relative to this matter: The sloop, we apprehend, was not in his majesty's service, as we are
      well assured that you were on a pillaging or pleasuring party; and although it gives us pain
      to use indelicate expressions, yet the treatment received from you calls for a state of the
      facts in the simple language of truth, however harsh it may sound. To your own heart we appeal
      for the candour with which we have stated them; to that heart which drove you into the woods
      in the most tempestuous weather, in one of the darkest nights, to avoid the much injured and
      innocent inhabitants of this county, who had never threatened or ill used you, and who would,
      at that time, have received you, we are assured, with humanity and civility, had you made
      yourself and situation known to them. Neither the vessel or stores were seized by the
      inhabitants of Hampton; the gunner, one mr. Gray, and the pilot, one <name>mr. Ruth</name>, who were
      employed by you on this party, are men, we hope, who will still assert the truth. From them
      divers of our members were informed, that the vessel and stores, together with a good seine
      (which you, without cause, so hastily deserted) were given up as irrecoverably lost, by the
      officers, and some of the proprietors, to one Finn, near whose house you were drove on shore,
      as a reward, for his entertaining you, &amp;c. with respect and decency.</P>
   <P>The threats of a person whose conduct hath evinced that he was not only capable, but desirous,
      of doing us, in our then defenceless state, the greatest injustice, we confess, were somewhat
      alarming; but, with the greatest pleasure, we can inform you, our apprehensions are now
      removed.</P>
   <P>Although we know we cannot legally be called to account for that which you are pleased to
      style an outrage, and notwithstanding we have hitherto by you been treated with iniquity, we
      will, as far as in our power lies, do you right upon just and equitable terms. </P>
   <P>First. We, on behalf of this community, require from you the restitution of a certain Joseph
      Harris, the property of a gentleman of our town, and all other our slaves whom you may have on
      board; which said Harris, as well as other slaves, hath been long harboured, and often
      employed, with your knowledge (as appeared to us by the confession of Ruth and others, and as
      is well known to all your men) in pillaging us, under cover of night, of our sheep and other
      live-stock. </P>
   <P>Secondly. We require that you will send on shore all boats, with their hands, and every other
      thing you have detained on this occasion. </P>
   <P>And Lastly. That you shall not, by your own arbitrary authority, undertake to insult, molest,
      interrupt, or detain, the persons or property of any one passing to and from this town, as you
      have frequently done for some time past. </P>
   <P>Upon complying with those requisitions, we will endeavour to procure every article left on our
      shore, and shall be ready to deliver them to your pilot and gunner, of whose good behaviour we
      have had some proofs. We are, &amp;c. </P>

   <P>My dear Brother I received your favour of the 11th inst. and have not time to congratulate you
      on your military behaviour, &amp; but little more than to request that you will endeavour to
      encompass your ends without bloodshed. </P>
   <P>I can no more at present than make you acquainted with two or three pieces of news in general
      - [Moses] Kirkland is on board the Man of War (the Fa mar) one [Bailey] Cheyney who came down
      with him as his friend &amp; Guard was before the Committee - afterwards Capt [Adam] McDonald
      of the Provincials disguised like a Cracker took Cheyney with him about nine o'clock at night
      to Ld. Wm's (Lord <name>William Campbell</name>) &amp; by the result of the conversation his trepanned
      Lordship advises the back Country people not to take up arms unless they think they are full
      strong enough - if they think they are they may: &amp; that they will be soon relieved by
      troops expected to be here soon - [Alexander] Innis has been ordered out of Town some days
      ago, &amp; is on board the man of war (the Tamar). </P>
   <P>The Governor detained the Mail about 24 hours in his possession - he has returned to the man

   <Title>DIARY OF CAPTAIN BARNARD ELLIOTT1</Title>
   <P>[Charleston, 16th September]</P>
   <P>on the day following [the capture of <name>Fort Johnson</name>] a detachment of the Chas Town Artillery
      company under the command of Lt Heyward arrived with a Gin &amp; other impliments for
      remounting the Cannon, the day being far advanced before things were in readyness for Work
      only three Cannon were mounted by the Artillery company, and as they were under orders to
      return that Night to Chas Town <name>Capt Elliott</name> undertook to remount the Cannon with his
      Granadiers, in this Work he was greately Assisted by Capt: Cochran, who was constantly present
      till the whole was remounted, but before this happend an engagemt had like to have taken place
      with the Tamar, the Night that the three Guns only were remounted, the <name>Tamar weighd-Anchor</name>
      with the Cherokee, a Sloop of War and One of the Packets (the Swallow) saild up, and about the
      Dawn of the Morn came within point blank Shot of the fort, from the intelligence we recd of
      the Council of Safety and the appearance of the Man of War &amp; her Consorts we had not the
      least doubt, but an engagemt would take place, as our three Cannon would have no success
      against the force that was to come against us, the Col: Orderd that When the Enemy began to
      fire, the troops should withdraw under the Cover of the fort, leaving the fort between our
      troops &amp; the fire of the Tamar, and that wh ever they landed any Men, as the Cannon of the
      Enemy could not then play upon us without destroying their own men, we should then make an
      attack upon them; this was the Order but the Man of War either for Want of a favourable Wind,
      or some other motive, Veer'd about, and took her old Station at a Random Shot from the
      Battery.-As Soon as we had our Guns on the East flank of the Battery remounted, &amp; pointed
      toward her, she Weighed Anchor, and gently dropt down with the Ebb Tyde to the lower most
      point of Sullivans Island, the Cherokee, and Packet following her example, where they now all
      lay out of the reach of our Cannon. Every thing being now Regulated, Guards establishd,

   <P>The Enemy and we are very near Neighbours. Our advanced Works are not more than five or 600
      Yards from theirs, and the main body of the two Armies scarce a Mile. We see every thing that
      passes, and that is all we can do, as they keep close on the two Peninsulas of Boston and
      Charlestown, both of which are surrounded with Ships of War, Floating Batteries, &amp;c. and
      the narrow necks of Land leading into them for.tified in such a manner as not to be forced

   <Title>VICE ADMIRAL <name>SAMUEL GRAVES</name> TO CAPTAIN <name>JAMES WALLACE</name>, <name>H.M.S. Rose</name> 1 </Title>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 17 Septr 1775,</P>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>With great Pleasure I have received and read your Account of the action with the Rebels at
      Stony town: I very much approve of your Conduct, and am happy to learn the good Effects
      resulting from it.</P>
   <P>The Rebels are fortifying their Sea Port Towns, and are endeavouring to equip a Naval Force;
      they will really become formidable from their unwearied Application and from remaining
      unmolested: therefore I can no longer forbear to take such measures on this occasion, however
      disagreeable and dangerous, as his Majesty's Honour, the safety of the Squadron and Army in
      America and my own Duty requires. To this end you will receive the inclosed Order; and I
      desire that in obeying it, you will endeavour to distinguish as much as possible his Majesty's
      loyal Subjects from his inveterate Enemies and Subverters of legal Authority and good
      Government.</P>
   <P>I observe you have manned two Sloops, and though I am satisfied how necessary small Vessels
      are for the Service you are employ'd on, yet the Ships with me are in such want of men, that I
      am obliged to take your Supernumeries, I consent however to your reserving twenty above your
      Complement, which with what you raise in future will make the Rose tolerably well manned.</P>
   <P>I send Lieutt. [Thomas] Graves in the <name>Bolton Brig</name> to reinforce your little Squadron, and will
      replace the Swan with another Sloop as soon as possible. A Letter from Governor Bruere
      Yesterday confirmed the Account you have given of the Robbery at Bermudas. We knew of the
      Powder being taken from the Storeship bound to St Augustine, but Sir <name>James Wright</name> hoped that
      the Carolinians intended it to fulfill their Indian Engagements, and that it would not have
      been sent to the Rebel Army. The Vessel with Arms from St Croix is bad News indeed.</P>
   <P>I hear the Alderney and Raven Sloops are on their passage to me from England; by these Vessels
      we may expect I think the ultimate Determination of Great Britain with respect to her
      rebellious Colonies. In the mean time we must endeavour to annoy and distress them to the
      utmost: You may expect to hear we have begun to the Eastward, but I would not have such
      Intention mentioned for obvious Reasons. I suppose you will not suffer them to carry off your
      Hay Sloop with impunity, but I desire you will be cautious of engaging with the shore where
      the Dangers are so disproportioned to the expected Advantages.</P>
   <P>We are and shall be in want of good Pilots for the Sound, Nantucket Shoals, and indeed for the
      whole Coast. Such as you can meet with I would have detained, and, if they will serve
      voluntarily, they shall immediately commence Pay. </P>

   <P>Whereas many Rebel armed Vessels inf est the Coast of America particularly about Providence,
      Rhode Island, Long Island, Long Island Sound, Mechias and the Bay of Fundy, who have already
      taken two of his Majestys Schooners and several Trading Vessels; And whereas there are
      undoubted preparations to put to Sea a Naval force to oppose his Majestys Arms, in the like
      rebellious manner as they have done by Land: You are therefore hereby required and directed to
      use every means in your power to take, burn, sink and destroy all and every Pirate or Rebel
      you meet in Arms whether on Shore or at Sea; And you are to do your utmost to lay waste and
      destroy every Town or Place from whence Pirates are fitted out, or shall presume to harbour or
      shelter them, together with all the Vessels of what kind soever therein; Protecting and def
      ending all People who shall upon your Summons return to their Duty and give immediate Proofs
      of their Sencerity by aiding and assisting you to their utmost, or by otherwise taking an
      active part against his Majesty's Enemies. And you are to give Orders accordingly to the
      Captains and Commanders of his Majesty's Ship[s] and Vessels under your Command. </P>

   <P>You are hereby required and directed to proceed in his Majesty's Sloop under your Command to
      the River Delaware, where, by stationing yourself occasionally in the River and cruizing as
      opportunity shall offer between the Capes or on the Coast, you are to exert your utmost
      Endeavours to carry into execution the Acts of Parliament restraining the Trade of the
      Colonies and to prevent the importation of Gunpowder Arms and Ammunition and every kind of
      illegal Commerce or Communication agreeably to the several Orders you have received. </P>
   <P>And whereas almost the whole Continent is in open Rebellion against his Majesty, and the
      Rebels have fitted out armed Vessels, and are endeavouring to equip a naval force to oppose
      and annoy--the King's Ships; You are hereby required and directed to take, sink, burn and
      destroy every American armed Vessel you meet with not in the immediate Service of his Majesty,
      or commissioned by his Majesty's Governors of any of the Provinces under his Hand and Seal for
      the express purpose of def ending themselves against, and to annoy, the Rebels. </P>
   <P>You are to seize all Ships and Vessels laden with Provisions, Wheat, Flour, Rice, Rum, Salt,
      Melasses. Lumber or Grain of any kind, whether'. they are in breach of any Act of Trade or
      not, sending or bringing them to Boston or Rhode Island which shall be most convenient. And
      you are also to seize and detain all Vessels laden or in part laden with Hemp, Cordage Canvas,
      Sails, Cables, Anchors or any other sort of naval Stores coming to America. You are to
      endeavour to procure Supplies of Provisions from the Contractors at Philadelphia; and, if that
      cannot be effected, you are, when you have only two months on board, to repair to New York to
      compleat; and if Supplies cannot be had from thence you are to join me at Boston. </P>
   <P>In case you are supplied with provisions at [New] York or Philadelphia, you are to continue on
      your Station as long as the Season will admit of your cruizing or lying with safety in the
      River, and then return to Boston. But should you at any time seize a Vessel or Vessels that
      cannot with prudence be manned from your Sloop, you are at liberty to convoy them to Rhode
      Island, and having delivered them into the Charge of the Commanding Officer there you are to
      return again to your Station or otherwise as shall appear to you best for the King's Service
      or as the Commanding Officer at Rhode Island shall direct. </P>

   <P>Sir.</P>
   <P>Your Favours of the 9, 15, &amp; 15.Inst. have been duly received: The Readiness of the
      Committee to cooperate with me in procuring the most authentick Intelligence &amp; dispatching
      Captn [Abraham] Whipple for this Purpose, is peculiarly satisfactory, &amp; I flatter myself
      will be attended not only with Success, but with the happiest Consequence to the publick Cause
      - I should immediately have sent you Notice of the Paragraph in the Philada Paper (which is
      all the Account I have of the taking the Powder at Bermudas) but I supposed it had come to
      your Hands, before it reached ours: I am inclined to think it sufficient to suspend Captn
      Whipples Voyage at least till further Intelligence is procured from Philada as it is scarecely
      supposable the Vessels would have left any Quantity behind worth the Risque &amp; Expence of
      such a Voyage. - As this Enterprize will therefore most probably be laid aside for the present
      it may be proper for Capt. Whipple to keep his Station a few days longer for the Packet. It
      must be remembered they generally have long Passages, &amp; we are very sure she has not yet
      arrived at Boston, nor do I find she is expected there. -</P>
   <P>The Voyage to Bayonne is what I should much approve &amp; recommend, The Person sent to Govr
      Trumbull has not yet called upon me; but the Scheme appears so feasible, that I should be glad
      to see it executed, at the same time I must add that I am in some doubt as to the Extent of my
      Powers to appropriate the publick Money here to this Purpose. I could wish you would
      communicate it to the Congress, for which you will have Time sufficient, &amp; I make no doubt
      of their Concurrence. In fact the State of our Treasury here at present is so low that it
      would be impracticable to be of any Service to the Expedition if all other Objections were
      obviated . . . </P>

      with about twelve Men, to watch their Motions; said Tender discovering three Men leaning on a
      fence near my house, they stood for the shore, as near as they could, and instantly fired two
      Guns, about 2 pounders, with Grape Shot, which was followed immediately with several volleys
      of small Arms from the Marines, which put the women and children in great confusion. - Said
      Guard running direct for the shore, the Tender instantly stood off, and before they could get
      to the shore by reason of a pond, she was out of shot. Altho' the shot flew very thick, a
      number of Women and Children escaped without hurt. </P>

   <P>Several small vessels, which had been most unrighteously taken by the ships of war on this
      station, were last Monday [September 11] stripped of every rag of sails, all their rigging
      except the shrouds, all their small stores, cables and anchors, turned adrift, and drove
      ashore on Goat Island &amp;c. These vessels, we understand, belonged to poor, laborious
      people, the whole support of whose families depended on what they made by freighting wood,
      &amp;c. -</P>
   <P>Last Monday the Swan sloop sailed to convoy several vessels to Boston, which had been taken in
      and off this port, viz. a sloop from Connecticut, bound to the West-Indies, with horses,
      &amp;c. a schooner from the West-Indies, taken out of Stonington; and a large sloop from
      Jamaic;a, which had been to New-York sailed from thence under pretence of going to England,
      and pretended to put in here for a mast; 1 and another sloop, with salt and some sugar, from
      the West-Indies.</P>
   <P>Last Thursday [September 14] sailed, the ship Francis, Capt. Buckley, and snow Flora, Capt.
      Forrester, for London; the ship Jacob, Capt. Cornell, and ship Cleopatra, Capt. Fitch, for
      Whaling; but were all obliged to return into this harbour. - The above vessels were convoyed,
      as far as they went, by the Rose, Capt. [James] Wallace, who kept out till Friday night, when
      he brought in a large sloop loaded with flour, &amp;c. from Philadelphia, which he took near
      .Block Island. 2 </P>

   <P>I wrote you Under the 10th Via Belfast this goes by Youngs snow Via Derry, &amp; a Coppy by
      Capt Egar Via Falmouth. 2 the[y] are the last Vessells to Sail but one, which one will not be
      ready some days, &amp; as I have now wrote to no person but your Self, would advise you to
      write to all our friends. I shall not write a Word of Polliticks as that might have the
      letters Stopped, and its the Same Case with every person, so you must Depend upon what the
      News tells you. be sure when you write our friends to request them giveing Earley orders and
      Sending out their own Vessells if Matters, are likely to be settled in the Spring if matters
      are to be Settled then, you may be sure Early orders here will put it in my power to Make my
      purchase by Contrect before any other person may have an order, and that by sending out their
      own or Charterd Vessells, it will prevent their being Disapointed, besides it will prevent
      Complaints of bad Vessells or high freights; there has not a Single penyworth been shiped
      Since the 10th but before that there was hardly a Craft that would Carry 200 barrells fitt to
      go to Sea, that was not loaded for the West Indies &amp;c and the Same in Philadelphia at
      present only three or four square rigged Vessells here, and we Suppose in two days there will
      be but two, &amp; when one of them will go we Cannot tell, the other is bound to London by
      whome we shall write again, &amp; after that Vessell, we know not when we shall have Another
      opportunity. the price of wheat &amp; Seed was 3/6 when the purchases Ended, at which price a
      Great dale was purchased tho the Generall price was 5/ for wheat &amp; 6/ for Seed during the
      purchase some flour has been sold for 10/6 &amp; we think it Cannot be much higher. however we
      are Convinced if a person wanted those Articles &amp; would Advertize 4 / for wheat or seed
      &amp; 12/ for flour, that he would get Enough so you se[e] how matters are alterd here. tho
      there is such Quantitys of those Articles Shipped of[f] Allready yet, I am well Convinced
      there are now as much of them, as ever was after, harvest at any one Season before - No letter
      lately from you nor no Acct of the Schooner. 3 if she Comes here I know not what will be done
      with her however Something Must, but I could wish you may have it in your power to Sell her,
      or do in Some manner with her that she May not Come Immediately here. Still in Debt and pushed

   <P>Gentlemen -</P>
   <P><name>Charles Town</name> So Carolina 18 Septem 1775 </P>
   <P>As we have business of very great importance to lay before you, which we think will merit the
      consideration of the Representatives of the United Colonies we are fortunate in meeting with
      the present opportunity for its conveyance by Mr Hindson who has promised not only to deliver
      our dispatches into your own hands but also to communicate a verbal message which cannot be so
      well imparted in any other manner. </P>
   <P>Recent transactions of a most dangerous tendency in the interior parts of this Colony, the
      treachery of our Governor who has been pursuing the Steps of Mr. [Josiah] Martin nearly as his
      situation would allow him, our late intelligence respecting the Indians &amp; the unhappy
      differences which now subsist among the Inhabitants of <name>Charles Town</name> render this application
      for your advice &amp; assistance absolutely indispensible. We had for some time entertained
      suspicions of the conduct of <name>L. <name>Wm. Campbell</name></name>, but a late circumstance has furnished us with
      positive proof of his disengenuity &amp; intention to undo us by stealth. His Lordship had not
      only shown a fair face when waited upon, but had in the most condescending terms invited
      Gentlemen to call on him in order to give him opportunity for expressing his good wishes to
      the Colony while he was at the same time privately spiriting up the p~ople on our Frontiers to
      oppose our Association &amp; to hold themselves in readiness to act in Arms against the Colony
      - after having received reiterated accounts of the increasing discontents of those people,
      together with assurances that they were instigated by the Emissaries of the British
      Administration &amp; supported by the promises of Royal favour, this Council judged it
      expedient to send proper persons to_ explain to them, the causes &amp; nature of the dispute
      subsisting between Great Britain &amp; the Colonies to endeavour to reconcile their minds to
      an Union in defence of their common rights; for these good purposes The Honble. Mr [William
      Henry] Drayton &amp; the Reverend Mr [William] Tennent were sent into those parts where the
      disaffected were most po'werful &amp; most numerous &amp; although their progress has been
      attended with many salutary effects yet particular characters and their abettors continued so
      irrectionable that it was found necessary to abandon the mild modes of persuasion &amp; to
      have recourse to the use of Arms which they had first taken up - we have now 1200. men of the
      Regiment of Rangers &amp; Militia under the direction of Mr. Drayton at Ninety Six we hope he
      will be able to suppress all opposition or at least to drive away the ringleaders of it. -
      among the head of our opponents was Capt <name>Moses Kirkland</name> who may with great justice be
      denominated a Traitor. - he had actually taken a Commission in the service of the Colony,
      &amp; had enlisted a Company of Rangers whom he afterwards incited to Mutiny &amp; Desert.
      this Man after having threatened the destruction of Augusta &amp; Recapture of Fort Charlotte
      in vain attempted to make a stand with his adherents &amp; being closely pursued fled in
      disguises to <name>Charles Town</name>, which he entered by night took sanctuary in the Governor's House
      &amp; was by His Lordship's means conveyed on board the Tamar Sloop of War. - A report of this
      fact was soon brought to the Gen. Committee which happened to be sitting &amp; a discovery was
      made of a person who had been one of Kirkland's Company of Rangers &amp; had attended him in
      his flight, this person being Committed to the Guard was made use of by some of the Officers
      of our Troops to carry on a stratagem the result of which you will learn from one of the
      inclosed papers marked &quot;Minutes of a Conversation.&quot; The Committee upon this
      discovery demanded a sight of the Letters which the Governor had just received from
      Administration by the Swallow Packet. His Lordship preemptorily refused to comply but in the
      course of conversation acknowledged that Ships &amp; Troops were to be sent from England to
      all the Colonies &amp; might be shortly expected; the next Evening he gave orders for
      dismantling <name>Fort Johnson</name> which was in part performed by men from on board the Tamar who
      dismounted all the Guns on the lower Battery &amp; broke many of the Carriages, after which
      <name>His Excellency</name> dissolved the Assembly &amp; without assigning any reasons in public, retired
      on board that Man of War where he has ever since remained &amp; from certain circumstances we
      believe he means to remove his family to the same place. - fortunately the Seamen neglected to
      spike the Cannon we have therefore taken possession of the Fort &amp; remounted them - the
      Garrison now consists of about 400. of our new raised Troops commanded there by Callo [Isaac]
      Motte we intend to persevere in repairing the Fort &amp; will put it in the best posture of
      defence. We also intend to fortify the Harbour as effectually as our circumstances will admit
      of - tis possible the Man of War may interrupt our proceedings, in such Case we shall be under
      a necessity of attempting to take or destroy her. - here we are at a loss to know to what
      lengths each Colony will be warranted by the Voice of America in opposing &amp; resisting the
      King's Officers in general &amp; the British Marine, tho' such opposition should be necessary
      for the very existence of a Colony &amp; support of the Common Cause. </P>
   <P>Our Provincial Congress in June last Resolved that Officers in the two Regiments of Foot in
      Colony Pay should when acting in Conjunction with Officers of the Militia of equal Commissions
      take Rank &amp; precedence of these without regard to dates of Commissions - this Regulation
      gave no Umbrage till lately, when we judged it necessary to Issue an Order for compelling many
      delinquents to do equal duty with their fellow Citizens in the Militia then a general Clamour
      was raised, petitions &amp; Remonstrances from the &quot;12 United Companies&quot; of
      Volunteers were sent in, to this board &amp; to the General Committee &amp; the dispute was
      carried to so great a height as to threaten an overthrow of our Association, temperate
      measures have however pacified many of the well meaning honest people who have been misled by
      the contrivances of false friends, nevertheless there remains no inconsiderable degree of
      ferment &amp; dissatisfaction - to this untoward circumstance add, the unfavourable accounts
      which we have received from the Indians, the danger which we are always exposed to &amp; more
      especially at this time from domestic Insurrection the expectation of British Troops &amp;
      Ships of War with other incidents hereafter to be mentioned &amp; you will agree that we have
      before us a very unpleasant prospect. We have been informed that you have granted 1000 Men to
      North Carolina on Accot. of the disturbance in that Colony, be that as it may surely we in
      this weaker part stand more in need of an Army of Observation &amp; General Officers to
      Command all our forces, at the general charge of the Colonies: we would if time had permitted
      have applied to North Carolina &amp; Georgia to have joined us in an application for such an
      Army, &amp; we now recommend it to your serious consideration &amp; enjoin you to Address the
      General Congress upon this subject &amp; to use your endeavors for obtaining such defence for
      us, without which Carolina &amp; Georgia will be involved in such difficulties as may &amp;
      probably will greatly injure the common Interests of America. We particularly request you to
      consider of proper measures for Regulating the Militia &amp; to procure a strong
      recommendation on this head from the Congress. </P>

      Custom House may soon follow the example &amp; we rather suspect it from an application which
      Mr Haliday has made for leave to retire from the province altho' he has assured us that he
      will leave a Deputy. We have used our utmost endeavours &amp; gone to very great expence for
      procuring amri:mnition, we were stimulated to the Act upon Lofthouse's Vessel at Augustine Bar
      by our hearty desire to supply the common Stock on your side, we rejoice to learn that you now
      have abundance We have also in our Magazine enough to serve our present purposes &amp; no bad
      prospect of receiving additional quantaties very speedily - but none to spare - Nothing would
      be more acceptable to us than two or three thousand stand of good Arms is it possible to
      obtain such &amp; so many from Philadelphia? if it is, we recommend it as a most essential
      service-</P>
   <P>Your letter of the 3d August with Resolutions of the 1st came duly to hand, perhaps after a
      Post Office is established, the Congress will find it necessary to open the American ports to
      Foreigners &amp; to pursue the most vigorous measures in our Infant state, by Sea as well as
      Land neither of which in our opinion can be effected if the Doctrine of abandoning our Sea
      Coasts should prevail - &amp; We must not conclude without intreating you to consider of
      proper measures for the keeping the Militia in due subordination &amp; procuring a strong
      recommendation, on this head from the Congress. - By order of the Council of Safety. </P>

      Carolina - I have not yet seen the Captain, who is sick, but din'd Yesterday at the Governor's
      3 with one of the Lieutenants - he says there has been no Action since that of the 17th of
      June, in which the Regulars had 92 Officers &amp; 1000 Privates kill'd &amp; wounded - Many of
      the Latter have s!fice dy'd - The Loss of the Provincials was at least double - he did not
      know either of the Governor's Sons particularly except Dick, who is lately gone Home - he was
      oblig'd to leave America on Account of his Health. the Lieutenant cou'd not tell whether it
      was George or Jack that fell in the last Engagement, but had heard that one of them had been
      so unfortunate as to lose his Life upon that Occasion - the other he has since seen, who by
      his Description appears to be George from what Doctor [Archibald] Campbell writes you. I think
      it is beyond a Doubt that it is Jack - poor Fellow! I am sincerely griev'd for him, and shou'd
      have been equally so for George, had he met with the same untimely Fate - There were no Troops
      arriv'd at Boston, nor had they receiv'd any Answer to the Dispatches sent by the General in
      Consequence of the last Battle - but the Lieutenant says they spoke with a ship from
      Londonderry a few Days ago,4 who inform'd them that 20,000 Russians and a like Number of
      English Troops were coming out &amp; may be minutely expected at Boston - they intend to make
      up an Army of 50,000 Men, so that America, it is probable, will soon be delug'd with Blood
      &amp; the Sword alone must determine the present unhappy Contest - they have now a great

   <P>Dear Sir,</P>
   <P>Sepr 19th 1775 Camp near <name>St Johns</name></P>
   <P>I take the Opporturiity of Fulmore's A Return with the Oneidas to acquaint you of our Arrival
      here on the 17th in the Evening. Yesterday Morning I marched with 500 Men to the North Side of
      <name>St Johns</name> where we found a Party of the King's Troops with Field Pieces. This Party had beaten
      off Major [John] Brown B a Few Hours before who had imprudently thrown himself in their Way
      depending on our more early Arrival, which thro the Dilatariness of our young Troops could not
      be sooner affected. The Enemy after an ill directed Fire for some Minutes retired with
      Precipitation, &amp; lucky for them they did; for had we known their Situation which the
      Thickness of the Woods prevented our finding out till it was too late, there would not a Man
      of them have returned. The old Story of Treachery spread among the Men, as soon as we saw the
      Enemy, we were trepanned drawn under the Guns of the Fort and what not.</P>
   <P>The Woodsmen c were not so expert at forming as I expected, and too many of them hung back.
      Had we kept Silence at first before we were discovered, we should have gotten a Field Piece or
      two. I have left the 500 Men at the joining O of the two Roads. This Day I have sent them
      entrenching Tools. Things seem to go well among the Canadians. It is strongly reported that
      the Kings Stores are embarked at Montreal in order to be removed. I have sent Col. [Ethan]
      Allen to Chamblee in Order to raise a Corps. Send me Money as fast as possible my Dear
      General. <name>Guy Johnson</name> &amp; [Daniel] Clause have represented us as beggarly Miscreants who have
      Nothing to give away to the Indians, nor to pay for what we get. Fulmore will give you an
      Account of our Council.</P>
   <P>I have great Dependance on your Presence at Tyonderoga to administer to our many Wants. I most
      earnestly hope this may find you relieved from the Acuteness of your Pain! A perfect Cure in
      so short a Time can hardly be expected. </P>
   <P>Believe me my dear Sir [&amp;c.]</P>
   <P><name>Richard Montgomery</name>. </P>
   <P>P.S. On the 17th at Night Major Brown intercepted eight Carts going to the Fort, laden with
      Rum &amp; Gun Carriages for the Vessels. Those Things were hid in the Woods, and were not
      recovered by the Enemy on Brown's discomfiture. </P>
   <P>A - Fulmore an Indian Interpreter who attended the Deputies of the six Nations to
      Caghnawagas.</P>
   <P>B - Major Brown I had sent on the 14th with 100 of our Men and about 34 Canadians towards
      Chamblee to keep up the Spirits of the Canadians, and to join the Army at <name>St Johns</name> as soon as
      it should arrive there</P>
   <P>C - Woodsmen I suppose the New Hampshire People and green Mountain Corps.</P>

   <P>Reynell &amp; Coates 2 </P>
   <P>My Last Salutes were paid you under 30th June since which I have received your esteem'd of the
      7th July, which should have answer'd immediately had Occasion call'd &amp; as I have Occaison
      now to write you, on some Real Business I shall make some Observations in 'said Letter by
      heartily thanking you for the Advancem[en]t you were pleas'd to make on Capt [William]
      Willcombs Cargoe, as well as for your Attachment to my Interest in storing said Cargoe for a
      Price &amp; I must now entreat, that you keep it in Store untill it will obtain 2/ which must
      very soon be the Case, if the present Contest continues. - Capt Willcombs Disburstments I
      think are very extravagant; his Sail Makers Bill, exceeds the first Bill she had of that Sort,
      &amp; I cannot account for it as no New Sails were made for her, but doubt not, you've
      obtain'd it as cheap as possible: I think your Charge of Commission is reasonable, even if you
      had not made the Advance, &amp; if those Advances are now detrimental to you, would have you
      sell as much Molasses as will reimburse you, &amp; keep the Remainder untill further Orders.
      No doubt you have heard in this, of the Scho[one]r Woodbridge Capt [John] Williamson, being
      carried into Boston, &amp; has been tried by a Court of Admiralty, &amp; acquitted, &amp; the
      last Advice <name>Mr White</name> was selling the Cargoe, 3 Flour at 22/ &amp; Corn at 6/ should that be
      the Case, &amp; you complied with my Orders (of which I have not been inform'd) I shall make
      something by the Adventure, but that rs a poor Consolation, for the Disappointment of the
      Flour; My Friends at Baltimore ship'd me, 13 Blls for my own Use which safely arriv'd here in
      a Vessell loaded with Com by which Means, my Family, will be ample provided for - I hope soon
      to hear from you of Capt Willcombs Arrival in Falmouth &amp; should he return to your Place,
      would have him, take on Board, all the Molasses I may have left, after deducting enought to
      pay your Ballance, &amp; lay with the same on Board untill the Season grows bad, &amp; then
      proceed hither, provided you can get the Vessell &amp; Cargoe insured at a reasonable Rate, as
      I imagine the Risque will be, but small, when the Season Advances, as the Cruisers cannot keep
      out much longer on this Coast, indeed the Risque now is not very great, if Care is taken by
      the Comm[amder]s to keep a good look out, &amp; run by Night, or in dark Weather as Vessels
      arrive daily, who conduct in that Manner, &amp; keep far to the Eastward, indeed but 2
      Vessells have been intercepted that were destin'd for this Port, &amp; one of them, was Mr
      Whites -</P>
   <P>I have within these few Days received Advice from Capt [Eleazer] Johnson of his Arrival in the
      West Indies, &amp; to an agreable Markett, &amp; as his Orders will admitt of his coming home
      late in the fall, he writes me the Prospect of making a Voyage is very great, &amp; he is at
      some Loss wither to take on a Cargoe for this Place or proceed with a freight to France; but
      as I have wrote him, such Encouraging Circumstances, how to conduct himself on the Coast,
      &amp; the Profitts he will make if he gets in Sa£ e, I am well convinced he will proceed for
      this Place, with his Hold, only full of Molasses, &amp; perhaps light Produce between Decks,
      which will put his Vessell in such a Trim as to enable him, to keep clear of most of their
      Vessells, she is very remarkable for Sailing, especially by the Wind, for when she was
      building, we had strong Suspicions of a french War, &amp; we built her for a Privateer &amp;
      she answers the Expectation as to her Sailing, for even Log Loaded the Lively Man of War;
      clias'd her 20 Leagues &amp; never gain'd upon her a Mile, until! the Wind veered &amp; bro't
      the Lively to Windward of her, when she with great Difficulty came up with her; I have thus
      given you her true Character, that if you can obtain Insurance upon her, you may be enabled to
      effect it on more reasonable Terms, as its Certainly less Risque on such a Vessell than common
      Merchantmen, she is well fitted, having two Sutes of Sales on Board, one of them entirely New,
      as many Light Sales, as a Brig can sett to Advantage, &amp; rigging sufficient to keep them
      &amp; the Spars in their proper Places, extreamly well manned, &amp; a Capable Comm[ande]r who
      is well acquainted with the Coast from <name>Nova Scotia</name> to <name>Cape Ann</name>, &amp; I have order'd him to
      keep far to the Eastward, &amp; if he is chas'd to put to Sea, if he cannot make a Harbour, so
      that he might not be caught within 3 Leagues of the Land, &amp; you may depend every Care will
      be taken to avoid a Capture, under these Circumstances, if the Gentlemen of your City, have an
      Inclination, to take Part of the Risque at a reasonable Premium, please to obtain the
      following Sums - £ 1200 Currency on the Brig <name>Dalton <name>Eleazer Johnson</name> Junr Master</name>, Valued at
      1600 £ Currency, &amp; £2000 on her Cargoe, &amp; Valued at £3,000 Currency; at &amp; from
      Point Petre in Guardaloop, to Newbury Port, with Liberty to put - into any Harbour, on the
      Continent for Safety, - I mean to have her insured against all Risque whatever, - If the
      Master can obtain Cannon &amp; Ammunition in the West Indies, I expect he will make her of
      considerable Force, sufficient at Least to defend himself from any Tender, but this I cannot
      warrant. he writes me he shall not sail untill the last of this Month or begginning of
      October, by the Time he may be on the Coast the Men of War, will be cautious of keeping at Sea
      -</P>
   <P>I refer you to <name>Capt Rogers</name> who is at your Place &amp; probably Mr Tracey &amp; many others,
      will be there, who know what I have said of the Brig, to be true, therefore hope you will
      obtain the Insurance on reasonable Terms, in doing which you will greatly oblige Your Esteem'd

      orders on the 9th. for their embarkation on the 10th with an additional number of about 300 to
      cover their landing and bring back the Boats, Copy of my Instructions to the commanding
      Officer inclosed No 2. For the Event of this intended Expedition, see No 3, which was drawn
      and delivered me by one of the Party, and from what I can learn is just. </P>
   <P>This Body returned on Monday the Eleventh. On Tuesday the twelfth I found I had upwards of 600
      sick; Waterbery's Regiment being reduced to less than 500. General Montgomery (for I was too
      ill to leave my Bed) perceived however with pleasure, that the Men were unable to bear the
      Reproach of their late unbecoming Behaviour, and taking the advantage of this happy Return to
      a sense of their Duty, on the 13th I issued the Orders contained in the Paper number four. The
      14th proved rainy and retarded the Embarkation of the Cannon. On this Day Col. Allen arived
      and made the Report No 5, and I found myself so much better that I had hopes of moving with
      the Army; but by 10 at night, my Disorder reattacked me with double violence, and every fair
      prospect of a speedy Recovery vanished. Great part of the 15th rainy, the embarkation much
      retarded by it. On the same day I received a Letter, of which No 6 is a Copy. On the 16th I
      was put into a covered Boat and left Isle aux Noix, and as it rained part of the Day, I do not
      suppose that General Montgomery could move until the 17th which proved fair. </P>
   <P>The mode of the intended Attack on <name>St Johns</name> &amp;c: as judged best, both by General Montgomery
      &amp; myself, is as follows: To land as near the Fort as we did the first time we went down;
      the two row Callies carrying a twelve Pounder each &amp; well manned; the Sloop and Schooner,
      and ten Batteaus with picked men to lay in the River, ready to attack the Enemy's Schooner
      (which is compleated &amp; carries 16 Guns) in case she should attempt to destroy our Boats,
      or get to the southward of them, &amp; thereby effectually cut off all communication between
      this place and the Army. After this naval Arrangement (which will take 350 Men) 500 men to be
      sent as a Corps of Observation to intercept any Succours between <name>St. Johns</name> and Chamblee, &amp;
      to keep as near the former as possible; two hundred Men in a Breastwork at the proposed
      Landing to cover the Boats and secure a Retreat for the Men in the Vessels and Boats, should
      the Enemy's Vessel be too many for them; the remainder of the Army to invest the Place, and
      make the Approaches, and erect the Batteries. </P>
   <P>You will perceive Sir, by No 3, that some of the Enemys Boats fired on our People; Capt
      [William] Douglas, who commended one of the armed Boats, pointed and fired a twelve pounder,
      loaded with Ball and Grape Shot at them, and we have Accounts that about thirty of the
      unfriendly Canadians were killed or drowned. In the first engagemt on the 7th we killed them 6
      Indians, two Caehnewagas, as many Mohawks (Danil and William a bastard Son of Sir William
      Johnson) one Canassadaga &amp; one Huron; and we are informed by a Caehnewaga and Huron whom I
      left at Isle aux Noix, that not an Indian remains at <name>St Johns</name>, &amp; which I believe to be
      true - The four Deputies sent by the six Nations to request the Canadian Indians to remain
      neuter were not returned when I left Isle aux Noix. I have taken the Liberty to desire General
      Montgomery to make a present in the name of the Congress to the Canadian Indians if he should
      think it necessary. </P>
   <P>Since the affair of the 10th the Army at Isle aux Noix which then consisted of 1394
      Effectives, all Ranks included has been reinforced by Capt Livingstons Company of New Yorkers
      nearly compleat, on the 16th by Col: [Seth] Warner whom I met an hour after my departure with
      170 green Mountain Boys (being the first that had appeared of that boasted Corps) he left this
      with about 50 more, but they mutinyed, and the remainder are at Crown Point; <name>Capt Allen</name>'s
      Campy of the same Corps arived here last night (every Man of which was raised in Connecticut)
      about 100 Men of Col: Bradles from New Hampshire (which Corps was to have been up a fortnight
      before, the remainder, 150 of that Body were yet to come) joined, the 16 at night, and I
      suppose the Artillery Company under Capt [John] Lamb will join them to day; these last were
      indispensably necessary, as we had none that knew any thing of the matter; so that the whole
      reinforcement consists of about 400. - Yesterday I sent off 60 of [James] Eastons, and 140
      more are just embarking, this is the whole of that Corps. About 125 of the first New Yark
      Battalion will embark early tomorrow together with the Company of Green Mountain Boys
      consisting of about 70. </P>
   <P>Two hundred and sixty of the 3d New York Battalion remain here which I will forward on as soon
      as I can procure Craft, which is building slowly, as most of the Carpenters are gone home
      sick. </P>
   <P>I am so feeble that altho' I have much to say about the sick, Musters, Accounts &amp; other
      Matters, I feel myself under the necessity of confining me to such only, which I humbly
      conceive more immediately require the Attention of Congress. </P>
   <P>If we succeed what Troops are to remain in Canada? How are they to be engaged for that
      service? The like for those at this Post, which at all events must have a Garrison, weaker or
      stronger, as matters may turn out in Canada. </P>
   <P>The Weather already begins to be cold, the Troops in three Weeks more will with great
      difficulty, be able to stand it, thinly &amp; poorly as they are clad; how are they to be
      supplyed? . </P>
   <P>What kind of Conduct am I to pursue with the Canadians respecting Civil Matters (for I hope to
      join the Army as soon as I am in the least restored). </P>
   <P>Where shall I get Gold &amp; Silver to pay for necessaries for the Army? Paper of any kind not
      having the least Currency in Canada? I wish a considerable Sum in Specie was immediately sent
      to Mr [Jonathan] Trumbull the Pay-Master. </P>
   <P>Please to let me know what I am to do with the Artificers taken out of the Troops. See my
      Letter of the 26th July 9th Paragraph. I also wish an answer to the second Paragraph of that
      of the 6th, also to the 4th of the same, respecting an Hospital_, in which I find there will
      be several Mates necessarily employed, as our Sick are so very numerous. </P>
   <P>I wish for some Resolution of Congress agreeable to my Letter of 31st July, as Mr Phelps still
      contines to act in conjunction with Mr Livingston, which must necessarily be introductory of
      Confusion, of which I fear there is too much already; one only should be employed as Chief in
      the Office, and the other may continue subordinate, for both are wanted. </P>
   <P>Should we meet with a Repulse, am I to prepare Timber for Vessels of superiour Strength to the
      Enemy's against next Spring? </P>
   <P>Perhaps other Matters of importance may have escaped my attention; should I recollect any, I
      will do myself the Honour to communicate them to you. I am Sir [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>Sir - By order of the Continental Congress, founded on the necessities of the present times,
      the Provincial Congress of this Colony has undertaken to erect a fortification on your land,

   <Title>TEN NEW ENGLAND SHIPMASTERS TO THE RHODE ISLAND GENERAL ASSEMBLY 1</Title>
   <P>Point Petre Guadaloupe, 19th Septr. 1775</P>
   <P>Gentlemen</P>
   <P>The mutual Obligations we are under to promote the Welfare of the Community to which we belong
      we hope will apologize for &amp; Justify us in giving you the following account. Vizt On the
      12th Inst Capt Stanton Hazard arrived here from Newport Rhode Island which place, he says he
      left the 26th July last not long after his arrival we were inform'd of his being loaded with
      Spermaceti Candles, Flour &amp;c. &amp; that he was design'd to Sell &amp; load here &amp;
      proceed to the Coast of Africa. what quantity of flour he has on board we are not a,ble to
      determine, but were assured by Mr. Soubies, as principal A Merchant as any in this place, who
      was treating with him for the purchase of his cargoe, that he offer'd him Sixty Bbls for Sale,
      adding that he must not Sell the whole of his Flour as he should want it for his own use, but
      upon Mr. Soubies being inform'd, that Capt. Hazards plan of Operation was in Opposition to the
      Spirit &amp; welfare of his Country, &amp; to the express prohibition of the Continental
      Congress, he declin'd having any connection with him or his Cargoe; the 15th Instant we sent
      Capt Hazard a Note requesting his attendance on shore the next Morning at nine oClock to give
      us some Satisfaction in this matter, with which he complied acknowledged the facts: As to the
      Flour, he said the exportation of it from Newport was approv'd by the Community, that he
      bought it in the Open Markett with a profess'd design of shipping it, that he publickly took
      it on board &amp; no Objections were made, as to his plan of procedure, which we suppose
      prohibited by the second Article passed by the Continental Congress the 20th Oct 1774, Capt
      Hazard plead that said Article must have been design'd to extend no farther than to fixing out
      V essells for the Coast of Africa directly from, &amp; importing Slaves directly back to our
      own ports, as by the subsequent part of said 2d Article, we are forbid dealing with those that
      are concern'd in said Trade, but the Congress do put Countenance upon our trading with the
      french, who are concern'd in that Trade, that this construction was not of his own making to
      justify his present procedure, but was the light in which it was universally received
      throughout the extent of his acquaintance, &amp; by the province of Rhode Island &amp; Town of
      Newport in particular that Mr [Samuel] Ward who was at that Time a Member of the Continental
      Congress declar'd to him, that this was the Sense in which they meant said second Article
      should operate &amp; no other, tho Mr Ward had some scruples in his own Mind relative to the
      legality of said Trade under any Circumstances whatever, that in consequence of said
      construction several Ves.5ells had already fitted out for the West Indies Islands, there to
      sell their Cargoes, take in others &amp; proceed upon the African Trade, &amp; that the
      Community looked upon every Man at liberty to use his pleasure in this Matter, that he bought
      his Stores of one of the Committee of Safety for the Town of Newport with whom he had several
      con£ erences relative to the African Trade in which said Gentleman had heretofore been
      concern'd, that his plan of Operation was publickly known, &amp; universally approv' d of in
      Newport, that the Odds between fixing out immediately from Newport or from the West Indies for
      the African Trade was very considerable &amp; as great a Sacrifice as any Man was called upon
      to make to the present Cause: However Gentlemen we apprehend Capt Hazard must have been
      mistaken relative to the design of said 2d Article &amp; that he has misrepresented the
      Construction &amp; Spirit of the People of Rhode Island in this matter, the 2d Article above
      referr'd to runs thus, Vizt &quot;That we will neither import nor purchase any Slave imported
      after the first day of December next, after which Time we will wholly discountenance the Slave
      Trade, &amp; will neither be concern'd in it ourselves, nor will we hire our Vessells nor sell
      our Commoditys nor manufactories to those who are concernd in it; [&quot;] We apprehend
      Gentlemen that the order not to hire our Vessels nor sell our Commoditys or Manufactories to
      those who are concern'd in this Trade is just as extensive as the prohibition of importation,
      i.e. Extends to the members of the same Community in their dealings with each other, but
      cannot with propriety be supposed to extend to the members of another Community over whom they
      never had Jurisdiction, &amp; by whose conduct in this matter they are not affected, to
      suppose they meant to prohibit the fixing out from or importing Slaves into their own Ports
      only, while their Members are left at full liberty to import them to every other part of the
      World, would not only be diametrically opposite the literal declaration &amp; obvious meaning
      of said second Article, after which Time we will wholly discountenance the Slave Trade &amp;c,
      but implies each Members discharge from all obligation to the Community immediately after
      their getting out of their respective Ports </P>
   <P>On Saturday Capt Hazard promised to give us a Certificate under his hand importing the whole
      of what he had said relative to the Exportation of Flour, the Circumstances of his shipping
      it, being publick, the approbation of the People of Rhode Island, his present plan of
      procedure, his Conference with Mr Ward, the Names of several Gentlemen of. the Committee of
      Newport with whom he had several Conferences on the above matter, &amp; who were full in his
      Opinion as above related, it was also at that Time agreed that Capt [Jonathan] Parsons, should
      receive the above mentioned Certificate, whi_ch Capt Hazard promised to deliver him the next
      Monday morning Accordingly on Monday Morning, <name>Capt Parsons</name> wrote a Note &amp; sent it by his
      Mate to Capt Hazard, of which the following is. a Cappy: &quot;<name>Capt Parsons</name> presents his
      Compliments to Capt Hazard &amp; in his own Name &amp; the Name of the English Masters
      present, begs the favor of Capt Hazard's sending by the bearer the Certificate he promised
      them last Saturday[&quot;] but as Capt Hazard was not up when the Note got on board, his Mate
      took the Note &amp; carried it below, &amp; retum'd with this Answer to <name>Capt Parson</name>'s Mate,
      from Capt Hazard Vizt that he need not wait, as Capt Hazard would send an Answer in his own
      Boat, but said answer has not yet arrived; since the above Matter has transpired we have
      treated Capt Hazard with that Contempt &amp; Detestation which every Traitor to the rights of
      his Country deserves;. it has been &amp; still is in our power to add to his punishment by
      depriving him of his Vessell &amp; Cargoe, as the least intimation of his having flour on
      board would effect it, but we never mean to leave it in any Man's power to Tax us with Actions
      that are purely illnatur'd, we only mean to do our utmost to preserve to ourselves &amp;
      posterity, those privelidges, which we never mean to part with but at the expense of our lives
      &amp; to discountenance &amp; detest the Foes of God &amp; Man </P>

      and now dwelling at Halifax aforesaid, personally came <name>Lemuel Brooks</name>, late master of the Sloop
      Neptune, 2 of, and belonging to Connecticut, and made this his protest, in manner and form
      following, viz:</P>
   <P>That, some time in the month of May last, he sailed in said sloop from New-Haven, in the
      Colony of Connecticut, bound to St. Martins, where he arrived and took on board a lading of
      sugars and of salt, from Salterudas; that on the sixth of August last he sailed in said sloop
      from St. Martins with said cargo, bound to New York; that on the sixth of September, being off
      MontaukPoint, on Long-Island, which bore from north about four leagues distance, he was
      boarded by two sloops, or tenders, belonging to his Majesty's Ships Rose, <name>James Wallis</name>, Esq.,
      commander, and Glasgow, Captain [Tyringham] Howe, commanded, who took out his mate, and all
      his hands, which they removed on board the tenders; and the next day carried the said sloop
      into Newport, Rhode-Island, where this protestor was ordered on board the Rose, and examined
      in regard to his cargo, of which he gave a full account. That this protestor requested leave
      of Captain Wallis that he might be permitted to go on shore, which was absolutely refused him,
      and he was, thereupon, ordered on board his own sloop, where he was detained a prisoner until
      the eleventh, following, when he was forcibly taken out and put on board a schooner which had
      been seized, and was ordered to Boston; that, on the 12th of September, being in Boston Bay,
      in said schooner, the protestor was ordered and taken on board his Majesty's <name>Sloop Hunter</name>,
      Captain McKenzie, then bound to Halifax, where this protestor arrived on the twentieth
      instant, and was soon after his arrival allowed his liberty by said Captain McKenzie, and came
      on shore at Halifax, where the protestor now is; of all which the said <name>Lemuel Brooks</name>, the said
      protestor, hath desired me to make a publick act. </P>
   <P>Wherefore I, the said Notary, at the request aforesaid, have, and do hereby, solemnly protest
      against the said <name>James Wallis</name> and Howe, Captains of said Ships Rose and Glasgow, and all
      concerned in the seizing, taking, and detaining the said <name>Sloop Neptune</name> and her cargo, and for
      all unlawful restraint of the liberty of said protestor, and for all costs, damages, and
      expenses, that have or may accrue for and by reason thereof. </P>
   <P>This done and protested at Halifax aforesaid, the day and year first abovementioned, the said
      protestor making solemn oath to the truth of the premises.&quot; </P>

   <P>Excellent Sir,</P>
   <P>I am now in the Parish of St Tuors four Leagues from Sorel to the South, have 250 Canadians
      under Arms. As I march they gather fast. These are the Object of taking the Vessels in Sorel,
      and <name>Genl Carleton</name>. These objects I pass by to assist the Army beseiging <name>St Johns</name>. If the Place
      be taken the Country is ours. If we miscarry in this, all other acthievements will profit but
      little. I am fearful our Army May be sickly &amp; that the Siege may be hard, therefore chuse
      to assist in conquering <name>St Johns</name>, which of Consequence conquers the whole. You may rely on it
      I shall join you in about three Days with five Hundred or more Canadian Volunteers. I could
      raise one or two Thousand in a Week's Time, but will first visit the Army with a less Number,
      &amp; if necessary will go again recruiting. Those that used to be Enemies to our Cause, come
      Cap in Hand to me, and I swear by the Lord I can raise three Times the Number of our Army in
      Canada provided you continue the Siege. AU depends on that, it is with the Advise of the
      Officers with me that I speedily repair to the Army. God grant you Wisdom Fortitude &amp;
      every Accomplishment of a victorious General. The Eyes of all America, nay of all Europe are
      or will be on the Economy of this Army - the Consequences attending it. I am [&amp;c.]</P>

      raising Batteries, but pray let no Object of obstruction be insurmountable. The Glory of a
      Victory which will be attended with such important Consequences will crown all our Fatigues,

      elevate us on the Wings of Fame. </P>

   <P>(No 37) </P>
   <P>Governor [George James] Bruere has sent Intelligence of Vessels from the Continent going to
      Bermuda, and carrying away a Quantity of .Powder from the Magazine, which some of the
      Islanders had assisted in forceing in the Night. There was a suspicion that some Attempt of
      the kind would be made upon the Island of New-Providence, and an armed Schooner with a
      Transport are Sailed to bring away the Artillery and Ammunition from that Island, and other
      Ships are Sent to North-Carolina to bring off the Artillery in Fort-Johnson. I hope to Send
      Some aid in a short time to Bermuda. We hear that the Colonies have fitted out several armed
      Vessels and sent them to Europe and the West Indies in Search of Ammunition, and there is
      Advice that a Privateer from South Carolina had plundered an Ordnance Ship off the Barr of St
      Augustine, where she was bound with Military Stores. </P>
   <P>A body of about 1200 Men was detached some Days ago from the Rebel Army as we learn towards
      Canada, by way of the Chaudiere. They marched to Newbery where they embarked in Sloops and
      Schooners and as they gave out were to proceed up the Kennebec as high as Fort Halifax. It is
      impossible without a Defection of the Canadians that they can succeed in any attempt against
      that Province; and Admiral [Samuel] Graves assures me, that there is a Frigate with two armed
      Schooners besides some armed Transports in the Bay of Fundy, and the Somerset of Sixty Guns at
      Halifax, should they attempt Nova-Scotia. I mean shortly to send Lieutenant Colonel [Joseph]
      Goreham to Halifax with all the Men of his own Corps and Colonel McLean's and two Companys of
      the 14th Regiment, which with the Recruits expected there from Newfoundland, three Companys of
      the 65th stationed there joined to the Militia of the Place, will together make a good Body
      for the Defence of Halifax. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>[Philadelphia] Septr 20th 1775.</P>
   <P>Your Letter of the 8th Inst was recd yesterday, and laid before the Congress. I am directed to
      express their Approbation of your Conduct, as stated in your Letter. Your taking Possession of
      the Isle au Noix, and the proposed Measures, for preventing the Enemies Vessels from entering
      the Lake, appear to them highly expedient and necessary.</P>
   <P>The Congress have such a Sense of the Importance of that Post, as to wish it may not be
      abandoned without the most mature Consideration, or the most pressing Necessity.</P>
   <P>They view the Expedition entrusted to your Care as of the greatest Consequence to the General
      Cause and as they clearly foresee, that its Influence whether successful, or otherwise, will
      be great and extensive. They are desirous that Nothing necessary to give it a fortunate Issue,
      may be omitted. </P>
   <P>They have ordered all the Forces raised in New York, immediately to join you; and those under
      Genl [David] Wooster to march immediately to Albany, from whence if you should think such
      Reinforcement necessary, you will be pleased to order them. </P>
   <P>Should you stand in Need of farther Reinforcement, the Congress desire you will apply to Genl
      Washington. </P>
   <P>The Congress repose the highest Confidence in the Abilities, the Zeal, and the Alacrity of the
      Officers, and Forces employed on this Expedition. They are determined to spare neither Men,
      nor Money; and should the Canadians remain neuter, flatter themselves, that the Enterprize
      will be crowned with Success, notwithstanding the great and various Difficulties, to which it
      has been, and still is exposed. </P>
   <P>It is with great Concern that the Congress hear of your Indisposition. They desire me to
      assure you of their warmest Wishes for your Recovery; and to request, that in discharging the
      Duties of your Station, you will not omit the Attention due to the Re-establishment of your
      Health. By Order of the Congress - I am &amp;c </P>

      Resolves aforesaid, Your Petitioners having not where withall to maintain them. </P>
   <P>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray -</P>

      Care and Management of two of the Callies which are to be fitted out for the Defence of the
      City; which will be considered by your Petitioners as a sufficient compensation for the loss
      of their Business and as a Maintenance for their families.</P>
   <P>And in Case This their Petition shall be granted, Your Petitioners will and do hereby engage
      to man the said Gallies out of the Body of your said Petitioners; or in Case your Petitioners
      shall not be sufficient of themselves to man the said Gallies, they do engage to find a
      sufficient number of effective men to compleat the Quantity necessary. </P>
   <P>Or in Case this Committee shall not think it proper to allow the Prayer of this Petition as
      above expressed, Your Petitioners humbly pray that they may be allowed to Fish or Oyster for
      the Support of their families, the produce of which they do engage shall be sold in Publick
      Market, that the Community may enjoy and partake of the benefits of their Fishery. </P>
   <P>And your petitioners do engage, That in Case this their last Petition shall be granted - That
      they will, as far as in them lays, avoid and shun any Ship or Vessel that may come in sight
      during the time they are employed in Fishing as aforesaid; and they do promise -</P>
   <P>That rather than they will bring up or come in the way of any Ship of Warr or Armed Vessell
      they will run their boats ashore and make their Escape in the best manner they can -</P>
   <P>In humble Confidence of the Prayer of their Petition being allowed, Your Petitioners, as in
      Duty bound, shall every pray. </P>

   <P>We are informed from good authority that a system of justice similar to that adopted against
      the devoted town of Boston, is likely to be established in this colony, by the renowned
      Commodore of the Virginia fleet. He has, in the course of this week, as a reprisal for the
      loss of his tender, seized every vessel belonging to Hampton that came within his reach, and
      thereby rendered himself the terror of all the small craft and fishing boats in this river;
      especially the latter, having brought some of them under his stern, by a discharge of his
      cannon at them. He has likewise seized a vessel belonging to the Eastern shore, and having
      honoured the passengers so far with his notice, as to receive them on board his own vessel,
      took the liberty of sending one of their horses as a present to L-d Dunmore. 1 This act of
      GENEROSITY we doubt not, will gain him considerable interest with his Lordship, it being an
      instance of his industry in distressing a people who have of late become so obnoxious to his
      Excellency for their spirited behaviour. We hope that those who have lived under and enjoyed
      the blessings of the British constitution, will not continue tame spectators of such flagrant
      violations of its most salutary laws in defence of private property. The crimes daily
      committed by this plunderer we would not willingly brand with the odious name of piracy, but
      we are confident they come under those offences to which the English laws have denied the
      benefit of clergy.</P>
   <P>We are just informed that he sent, some days ago, a message to the inhabitants of Hampton,
      with a proposal that if they would return the stores, &amp;c. taken on board the tender, he
      would molest them no longer, but retire peaceably to his old station. This proposition being
      taken under consideration by the principal inhabitants, an answer was returned promising a
      compliance with the Captain's request, provided he would deliver up a negro slave belonging to
      Mr. <name>Henry King</name>, who has long acted as a pilot to the Otter; but this the honest Captain, as
      well on account of the fellow's knowledge of the rivers as his singular ATTACHMENT and LOYALTY
      to his sovereign, refused, and, after damning the IMPUDENCE of these people in demanding his
      Ethiopian director, swore he would make them no other reply than what his cannon could give
      them; Accordingly he has taken his station between the two bars to be more convenient for the
      business. </P>

   <P>On Tuesday Evening [September 19] the Amboy Stage Boat in returning to this City with
      Passengers, was brought to, by the Asia Man of War's boat, and Capt. [Ensign Edward] Tiley, an

      of War, with a box of Papers in his Custody, also 3 Guns which were on board the Stage Boat.
      The Pretence for this felonious piratical Outrage, is said to be the detention of a suspected
      Person, who is on his parole of Honour in Gen. Wooster's Camp. This Person having been
      observed to follow at a Distance, a load of Powder on its Way to the Camp at Cambridge, was
      taken into Custody by the Rifle Men and carried to General Washington, who not finding any
      Evidence against him, sent him to Gen. Wooster, who at his Request, permitted Capt. Tiley to
      go for him to Bordon Town for a Box of Papers, which he said would clear his Character, and
      prove him to be a true Friend of the Liberties of America. It is imagined, that on his
      Intelligence, Capt. Tiley was detained. If so, it will be but Justice to retaliate on him any

   <P>We are sorry to inform the public, that the late storm on the 2nd instant, so destructive
      here, was succeeded by another at sea, on Sunday the 10th, which continued much longer, and
      was very violent. - The ship Annapolis, <name>James Hanrick</name>, master,'carried away all her masts, in
      long. 67°, 00', lat. 37°, 58', - was two days in great distress - then met with, and was
      assisted by a schooner from Bristol, Capt. Stetson, for Baltimore, 1 who with great humanity
      continued by the ship till she got up jury masts - the schooner was distressed for provisions
      when she fell in with the Annapolis, who happily relieved her. </P>
   <P>By Capt. Stetson, of the schooner above-mentioned, just arrived at Baltimore, we are since
      informed, that Capt. Hanrick, on a consultation with his officers and crew, all of whom,
      though many hurt by the falling of masts, rigging, &amp;c. were in very good spirits, was
      determined to proceed to Europe with the ship, which was in good condition as to her hull, and
      worked well under her jury masts. - Capt. Stetson left the Annapolis with a fair wind on
      Monday evening the 18th instant, in lat. 38, 4, long. 72, 50, standing to the Eastward. </P>
   <P>On Tuesday the 19th, the brig Two Brothers, Capt. Brewster, for Philadelphia, came up with the
      ship, and took off all the passengers, amongst whom were the honourable <name>George Steuart</name> and his
      son, <name>Lloyd Dulany</name>, Esq, and Lady, <name>George Digges</name>, <name>Edmund Price</name>, and <name>Alexander C. Hanson</name>, Esqrs.

   <Title>&quot;THOUSANDS&quot; TO JoHN PINKNEY, PRINTER OF THE <name>Virginia Gazette</name> 1</Title>
   <P>Mr. Pinkney,</P>
   <P>[Williamsburg, September 21]</P>
   <P>If you can, please to inform us why the Mercury man of war, which has so long been the terror
      of Norfolk, and a refuge to our slaves, is not yet burnt, notwithstanding she has been ten
      days and upwards upon her broadside. We, sir, who live at a distance, are at a loss how to
      account for the strange remissness of the inhabitants of Norfolk in neglecting to seize the
      opportunity which Heaven has kindly thrown in their way. Surely the interest of the mayor,
      who, from his letters to [John] Macartney, seems to prefer the friendship of that deceitful
      enemy to the welfare of the town over which he presides, must have prevented the noble rage of
      the citizens from bursting forth in vengeance upon that accursed vessel, which they now have
      in their power to sacrifice for the captain's bloody threats to destroy their town. We can by
      no means attribute the omission to a partiality in the inhabitants of Norfolk to the avowed
      enemies of our country; nor can we suppose them so far destitute of courage as to be afraid to
      make the attempt. But let the cause be what it will, we do inform them, through the channel of
      your intelligence, that unless they immediately perform this act, so ardently wished for by
      their countrymen, and so easily to be effected, that Thousands are resolved to burn the
      devoted vessel, even if the consequence of it should be the total ruin of Norfolk.</P>
   <P>Thousands. </P>
   <P>1. Pinkney's <name>Virginia Gazette</name>, September 21, 1775. </P>
   <Title>ANONYMOUS LETTER TO <name>JOHN PINKNEY</name> 1</Title>
   <P>Mr. Pinkney,</P>
   <P>[Williamsburg, September 21]</P>
   <P>We are highly pleased with the conduct of the people of South Carolina, who have taken the
      troops destined for Virginia from <name>Saint Augustine</name>, and think ourselves the more obliged to
      those brave Carolinians,2 as those troops were to have been a reinforcement to the sixty men
      who have been so very formidable to the towns of Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Gosport. What might
      have been the consequence had they arrived! But to be serious: How long will the inhabitants
      of those Towns suffer themselves to be so shamefully insulted by l--d D----e [Lord Dunmore]
      and the Captains of the men of war? To what is it owing that their committees have so
      unaccountably acquitted some late extraordinary delinquents? Is it to a want of zeal in the
      glorious cause, or of spirit to prosecute it? But we trust that the people of Norfolk will
      remove our doubts and jealousies, and wipe off every stain on their characters, by making a
      proper use of the golden opportunity Heaven has now afforded them. To do this nothing is
      requisite but a little spirit, with some address and ingenuity in the application of it. A
      number of small vessels may be easily fitted out as fire ships, and may be used with almost
      certainty of success, and without the least risk of lives on our part. Nor can the most loyal
      of his majesty's subjects condemn this measure, since it is but a proper chastisement of the
      most despicable tools of his greatest enemies; nor can humanity forbid it, because it is
      dictated by some of its first feelings, an honest indignation, and the love of our country,
      and is en joined by the first law of nature. </P>
   <P>When king, lords, and commons, have combined to enslave us; when a corrupt and abandoned
      Parliament have voted their lives and fortunes at the service of a perfidious, cruel, and
      bloody administration, in the execution of their wicked plan; when, in consequence of this,
      fleets and armies are sent against us, which have pillaged our coasts, bombarded our towns,
      and but for the glorious intrepedity of our countrymen, under the particular favour and
      protection of the Almighty, would have spread desolation throughout our land; when we consider
      the damnable plot that has been laid against us, of stirring up the Canadians and Indians to
      attack us on our frontiers, and our slaves and tories within the body of our country, whilst
      their fleets were to lay waste our coasts; and when we have seen this plan recommended in a
      pamphlet written by an accursed pensioner, Doctor [Samuel] Johnson, by the order of the
      minister, and under the particular patronage of the king; when we consider these things, who
      can hesitate a moment to declare that we ought to do all in our power to be revenged on such
      an administration, and to hurl down destruction on all the infernal tools? Let not our
      countrymen think that captain Macartney deserves more indulgence than captain Squire, or lord
      Dunmore: He, like captain Montague, has taken upon himself to interfere with the civil power,
      has impudently supposed that his presence could awe a committet; 1 and protect a culprit, and
      has wickedly threatened to fire on a defenceless town. But let captain Macartney know, that
      whenever he lands in Virginia he is amenable to the laws of Virginia, which may punish him as
      a trespasser, rioter, or murderer, or as a rebel, if he should, like l--d D----e and Squire,
      attempt to raise an insurrection; and we would have all those tools of government to know,
      that, whenever they return to England, we shall try the full force of the English laws against
      all such offences as they have or shall commit here. The American governors shall severely
      answer for their conduct in the King's Bench, and judges shall remember the fate of Epsom and
      Dudley. 3 </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Sept 22d 1775.</P>
   <P>In my former Letter I said, that &quot;the Harbor [of Boston] might be blocked up; and both
      Seamen and Soldiers made Prisoners at Discretion&quot;; which seems to you incredible: -
      Please, to read at your Leasure the following Explanation: - There are but two Channels,
      through which Ships of Burthen can pass to and from Boston: - One of them runs between. the
      west Head of Long Island, and the Moon, (so called) and is about a Mile across: - This Channel
      is too shallow for any Ships of War above 20 Guns: - The other runs between the east Head of
      Long Island, and the south Point of Deer Island; and is about a Mile &amp; half from Side to
      Side: - This, the only Channel through which capital Ships can pass, leads (outward bound)
      through the Narrows (so called) between Gallop's Island and Lovel's Island; where the Channel
      is not wider, than the Length of a 50 Gun Ship. - In the opening between Gallops Island &amp;
      George's Island, is Nantasket Road; where, one, is always, and at present, five Men of War are
      stationed, to gaurd the Narrows from being stop'd up: </P>
   <P>Upon the foregoing Facts, I thus reason:</P>
   <P>The Moon Island communicates with Squantum Neck; at low Water, almost dry shod: A defensible
      Fort, therefore, upon Squantum, may be so placed, as to secure a Retreat not only from the
      Moon, but from Squantum to the Main: - one upon the east Head of the Moon, and another, if
      found necessary, upon the west Head of Long Island, secures the Passage between, and covers a
      Retreat from the Latter to the Former: Another upon the Summit in the middle of Long Island
      covers the Shore on each Side; so, as that no Force can land without being greatly anoyed, if
      not entirely prevented. Another strong Battery from 20 to 40 Peices of heavy Cannon at the
      east Head of Long Island; commands, not only the Ship Channel, but the Narrows, and Nantasket
      Road, so that no Ship can remain there with Safety; and consequently, by sinking Hulks in the
      Narrows we might prevent any Ship of Force from going out or coming in. - If the Passage thro'
      the Narrows is not stop'd, I am sensible, a Ship with a fresh Gale of Wind, and flood or Ebb
      Tide, which is rapid between Long Island &amp; deer Island, might run through without any
      great Hazard; but, after the east Head of Long Island is fortified, I can forsee Nothing to
      hinder, the Narrows being reduced to such a Draught of Water, as that, no Vessel of any
      considerable Force, can pass through there - This, being effected; as I said above, both
      Seamen and Soldiers, if they dont escape, by a timely Flight, must become Prisoners at
      Discretion. </P>
   <P>I have been told, there is in one of the English Magazines, an accurate Draft of the Harbor: -
      If you can procure it, upon Examination, you may determin[e], the Distance and Depth of Water
      between the Islands aforesd with Precision; and consequently, whether such a Scheme is
      practicable or not. </P>
   <P>I have thought, and said from the Beginning, that Row Callies must be our first mode of
      Defence by Sea; it gives me therefore, Pleasure to hear, our worthy Friend Doctr F[rankli]n is
      employed in constructing some for the City of Phildia: I wish I had the same Employment here;
      for I am very sure, twenty of them, under proper Direction, would have taken or destroyed all
      those Cruisers and Cutters, that have infested, and done so much Damage in the Vineyard &amp;
      long Island Sounds in the Course of the Summer past; besides, being a safe Convoy to our
      Provision Vessels. - When I first proposed the Scheme to our Comtee of Safety, it was
      objected, that, we had no Body skilled in the Construction of them: Afterwards I heard of a
      Ship Carpenter, just escaped from Boston, who had been several Years a Prisoner in a turkish
      Row Galley, and had formed a compleat three feet Model of one: - It was then objected, that,
      heavy Cannon, and Powder were wanting: - An insuperable Objection, most certainly; which I
      hope will soon be removed. </P>
   <P>Several Vessels have lately arrived in Boston from England; but the News they bring is
      industriously secreted: - The sullen Silence, and dejected Countenances of the Officers, give
      Rise to various Conjectures: - God grant: the Truth may be a Dissolution of a venal P-t, a
      disbanded Army, and an Order for the Ships and Troops here to return imediately Home. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Having occasion to send Eleven Transports to sea, which go under the Convoy of Captain
      [Thomas] Bishop; and as it is absolutely necessary such a number of Ships should have an
      Agent, to Command them, I am to beg you will Order Lieutenant Parry to take this Business upon

   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> Sept 22. 1775</P>
   <P>By your Letter June 24, indosing a Copy of Mr Grants Letter to the Victualling Board, I am
      acquainted that their Lordships desire to know by the first Conveyance what is the State of my
      Provisions for the Squadron, what further Supplies may be necessary, and when and where I
      would have them sent.</P>
   <P>In my Letter August 19 I mentioned generally our Situation and Dependence with respect to
      Provisions, and I wrote somewhat more particularly to the Victualling Board, a Copy of which
      is now inclosed.</P>
   <P>I inclose also an account of Provisions belonging to the Contractor in Store at Boston for the
      use of the Fleet. But it must be remembered that we have no reliance on that Scheme of baking
      Bread this Winter at Boston. Wood is and will be too scarce and dear, it is now from six to
      eight Dollars a Cord; and I really do not believe it will be possible for the Agent to bake
      either Loaves or Biscuit, whatever he may think. It will be difficult to provide Fuel to brew
      Spruce Beer for the Squadron; but this they may depend upon having both here and at
      Halifax.</P>
   <P>I do not find the New York people have yet refused to give the Asia Prov1s1ons. It is thought
      Philadelphia and the Carolinas will not furnish much longer. The Ships at Virginia still get
      Supplies. At Rhode Island the Contract has totally failed. At Quebec provisions are dear, but
      the few Ships that go there will get what is required.</P>
   <P>But although his Majesty's Ships to the Southward are furnished with provisions at present,
      may it not be to prevent Supplies being sent from England, in order by discontinuing suddenly
      in the middle of Winter to involve the Squadron in the deepest distres.s ? The resolves of the
      Congres.s respecting nonimportation &amp;c will greatly impede our having provisions
      regularly. Upon the whole I beg leave to offer it as my opinion that we should not rely upon
      the Continent of North America for Supplies of Provisions this Winter. Their Lordships have
      already been pleased to order a proportion of 5000 men for four Months, except Spirits, to be
      sent here without Delay. The Ships that come to America in future may bring what they can
      conveniently stow; and we are provided until the end of February if the Friendship Victualler,
      one of the first four, arrives safe. I should be glad that our Supplies may be sent to Rhode
      Island, Halifax, or Boston; And, if their Lordships please, the Transports may be ordered to
      go to either of these places as Winds and Weather may suit. </P>
   <P>Being on the Subject of provisions it indispensably becomes my Duty to represent to their
      Lordships that the custom of supplying New England Rum to his Majesty's Ships is in my humble
      opinion highly prejudicial to the State. The use of it destroys the Health and Faculties of
      the People, and debilitates them surprizinzly. The Seamen always continue healthy and active
      when drinking spruce Beer; but in a few days after New England Rum is served, although mixed
      with four or five Waters, the Hospital is crouded with sick, and those on board are pallid,
      weak, and incapable of doing half their Duty. I appeal to the Captains of the Squadron that
      this is always the Consequence of their Crews having New England Rum. It is indeed beyond
      Contradiction. At present the Want of fuel will in some measure prevent distilling; But it is
      a melancholy Consideration that the Seamen in his Majesty's Service must use the most
      pernicious of all Liquors, and that too often in its very worst State. Upon Inquiry I find
      that the current price of Rum at Boston from the Windward Islands has been from 22d to two
      Shillings sterling p Gallon by the single Cask, and that good Jamaica Rum never exceeds half a
      Crown a Gallon, but has heen generally sold at two Shillings and three pence. I therefore
      eamesty hope their Lordships will be pleased to take this matter into Consideration, and that
      in all future Contracts, good merchantable Rum from the West India Islands may be furnished to
      the Squadron and not less than six months old. I am &amp;c </P>

   <P>That the abovesaid petitioners, have been confined almost these three weeks, upon their own

      infancy, and in consequence must suffer. Then their maintenance depends entirely upon your

      likewise understood that the gentlemen of the Committee have waited for evidence from our
      parts, to prove a crime against us. But we are sensible none cannot be brought in truth; and,
      besides, it seems to us, if there was any, they might have been here before now, for which
      reason we pray to be discharged.</P>
   <P>Supposing we had committed a crime against your resolves, it was before the resolves came in
      force, and we were likewise unacquainted of it; and, also, we think we have been sufficiently
      punished for it, according to your resolves; for the first offence is three months'

      than that Sum, however 'tis of Small Consequence. we hear the J &amp; P 2 had arriv'd after a

      under 13d indeed at the very time we c[oul]d have got 13½d p B but wish'd to carry on our
      Connexion with you. we believe too if you enquire you'll find our Cargo considerably Cheaper
      than any bot at the Same time in every thing we Act'd for the best &amp; doubt not you do the
      Same, 'twas with difficulty we persuaded <name>W. Smith</name> to accept the 13d, You Say 20 days is too
      Short to unload in. you know well the Expence of your Port that unless great dispatch is given
      nothing can be made by Ships however for 4 or 5 days we wd make no Accot, by her detention
      last Voyage She made Scarce any thing &amp; 'tis owing to that, we can make two Voyages to
      Lisbon to One to your place, we are Sorry you misunderstood us when we Said the Cargo wd be on
      joint Accot. W. S. insisted on having 1/3indeed we expected you would be better pleas'd to

   <P>2. From <name>Joshua Barney</name>'s account, Murray was not a rascal, but a valued friend, and the
      merchants at Nice, to whom the cargo of the Sidney was consigned were the &quot;real villains
      in the piece.&quot; After early promises to pay the Murray bills, they then refused on the
      grounds that as Barney was a minor his bond was illegal. Part of the cargo had been landed
      when the refusal was communicated to him, so Barney clamped down the hatches and kept the
      remainder of the wheat onboard. This brought an order to appear before the Governor, who had
      him jailed, and threatened to confiscate the ship, but with a promise of release for the young
      mariner if he would permit the remaining cargo to be landed. Concluding that to sit in prison
      would not help the situation, Barney agreed to the demand; was freed, went on board the Sidney
      and claiming that a promise under duress was not binding, still refused to open the hatches.
      The Governor sent an officer and soldiers, whereupon Barney took his whole crew ashore, and
      surrendered the ship, with the British flag still flying. Then, with the younger Murray, he
      crossed the Alps to Milan, then the capital of Sardinia, and laid his case before Sir William
      Lynch, the British Ambassador. An appeal by the Ambassador to the Sardinian Court brought
      quick results, and Barney, with Murray, returned in triumph to Nice, where a subdued Governor
      gave him possession of the Sydney, and Vicrne &amp; Veillon hastened to discharge the Murray
      bond. Whereupon the remainder of the cargo was landed, and Barney sailed from Nice in June.

   <Title>INTELLIGENCE FROM NEW BERN, NORTH CAROLINA, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1775 1 </Title>
   <P>This week will ever be remembered as the most remarkable epoch in the annals of this Country,
      for the discovery of the grand repository and dark depositum of Govern our Martin's infernal
      magazine, which, with cool deliberation, he intended to deal out, in missive weapons of death,
      to the good people of this Province. In the Palace garden, and under a fine bed of cabbages,
      was discovered and dug up a barrel containing about three bushels of gunpowder; in the Palace
      cellar was also dug up two quarter-casks of the same commodity - the casks quite new, and
      marked <name>R. B</name>. In the Palace garden was also dug up about cne thousand weight of musket balls,
      lately cast; about five hundred weight of iron swivel balls; a large quantity of small shot,
      lead, iron, worms for the cannon, with swabs, rammers, artillery boxes, matches, and the whole
      apparatus for his park of artillery, which he would have certainly mounted at the Palace, had
      not the appearance of the people of the Town of Newbern, on his attempting to move the Palace
      guns, driven him from the trenches before he had made them quite tenable. It is said his
      Excellency, the night before he took his precipitate flight from the Palace, buried these
      engines of death, as they might remain in places of safety till he or his creatures might have
      an opportunity to use them. The Palace cannon, it is said, were spiked up after his Excellency
      left the Palace, by a person who, no doubt, will be obliged to answer for his conduct. As it
      is improbable the Governour could procure these deadly weapons without assistance, the
      Committee of this Town and County are using their utmost diligence to discover the authors of
      so black a treachery. </P>

   <Title>INTELLIGENCE FROM HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA, SEPTEMBER 23, 1775 1 </Title>
   <P>Yesterday a schooner arrived, with two tons of tea, from Bristol; the liberty boys immediately
      committed it to the sea. They have strong assurances of assistance from the Provincial Army,
      therefore it is to be feared that His Majesty's yard, stores and munition in this Province,
      will be destroyed. The Tartar Frigate is here, to protect them; and the master shipwrights,
      caulkers, joiners, house-carpenters, smiths, briglayers and labourers, form a militia, and
      mount guard every night for the protection of the yard, &amp;c. The inhabitants begin to grow
      very warm, therefore suppose it will not be long before they find the Militia some military
      employment. Our Governour has wrote to Boston for assistance, but has received for answer,
      that they have more work cut out there than they have hands to complete, therefore no help can
      be expected from thence. We have been continually supplying the Army at Boston with fresh
      provisions, hay, corn, &amp;c., but the case is so much altered that nothing is suffered to be
      sent them from hence. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>I understand that you have detained on board your Ship Ensign <name>Edward Tyley</name>, on suspicion of
      his being aiding and assisting in burning the Barge belonging to the Asia, on or about the
      12th of July last. It was an unhappy piece of business and much against my mind. But upon
      hearing the particulars I doubt not you will be convinced that Mr Tyley not only had no hand
      in it, but exerted his utmost efforts to prevent it. At that time I had a quantity of
      Provisions in a Store on that Slip, where there was a small guard, kept under the care of
      <name>Ensign Tyley</name>. The Sloop which brought the Provisions lay at that place, the Master of which
      seeing the Barge come in there, suspected they had a design against him, and with the advice
      of a number of People who had collected, was determined to take the Barge with the men in her.
      I understood in the time of it, both from <name>Ensign Tyley</name> and the Bargemen that Tyley did every
      thing in his power to prevent it, but finding it impossible to withstand the torrent, he
      escorted the men to me Upon hearing of this affair from him, and the Bargemen (who among other
      things told me that they did not know but they should have lost their lives had it not been
      for EnsignTyley [)], I ordered <name>Ensign Tyley</name> with a large party to conduct the men back, to put
      the Barge into the Water and to see every thing that belonged to her was returned, for what
      happened afterwards I must refer to you the inclosed Affidavits,2 and when you have duly
      considered of the affair with all its circumstances - I flatter myself that from your wonted
      candour and generosity, you will liberate Mr Tyley and you will much oblige [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>On the morning of the 24th day of September, I set out with my guard of about eighty men, from
      Longueil, to go to La Prairie; from whence I determined to go to Genl. Montgomery's camp; hut
      had not advanced two miles before I met with Major [John] Brown, who has since been advanced
      to the rank of a Colonel, who desired me to halt, saying that he had something of importance
      to communicate to me and my confidants; upon which I halted the party, and went into an house,
      and took a private room with him and several of my associates, where Col. Brown proposed that,
      &quot;Provided I would return to Longueil and procure some canoes, so as to cross the river
      St. Lawrence a little north of Montreal, he would cross it a little to the south of the town,
      with near two hundred men, as he had boats sufficient; and that we would make ourselves
      masters of Montreal.&quot;This plan was readily adopted by me and those in council; and in
      consequence of which I returned to Longueil, collected a few canoes, and added about thirty
      Eniglish Americans to my party, and crossed the river in the night of the 24th, agreeable to
      the before proposed plan. </P>

   <P>The Emigrations to North America being at this period very great and notorious, the Admiral,
      who considered all private men coming from any other Country at such a time to the Colonies as
      Enemies to Great Britain, sent Directions to the Captains on the several Stations for seizing
      all Emigrants, and giving the Officers of his Majesty's Army the utmost assistance in
      enlisting them, . . . He likewise issued special Orders to the Commanders of Pacquet Boats for
      using circumspection and guarding against the prize of their Mails. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>lnclosed you will receive an Extract of a Letter to me from General Gage, with a Copy of one
      inclosed to his Excellency from Lieutt <name>Duncan Campbell</name>, representing that you refused him
      assistance to enlist Emigrants, for the Kings Army. 2 On this Occasion I must refer you to my
      Letter of the 18th July, and desire you will send me your Reasons for not assisting Lieutt
      Campbell according to my Orders. At present it appears to me that if the two Ships with
      Emigrants had been compelled to anchor close to the Asia, and you had given proper Countenance
      to the Land Officers, a considerable Number of Recruits would have been raised for his
      Majesty's Service. </P>
   <P>I send you an Order respecting such Vessels as may in future arrive from Great Britain or
      Ireland with Emigrants. It is not necessary I am sure to acquaint you that men from any other
      Country coming to America must be considered as Enemies to Great Britain, and treated
      accordingly, by being immediately seized, and, if practicable, sent here. </P>
   <P>Mr Shank delivered me your Letter of the 10th instant. I have also received another dated the
      5th by the <name>Gage Sloop</name>.3 The Report of the Master of the Brig from Liverpool is not true, Ships
      were fitting out in England and several are hourly expected. </P>
   <P>Bad as the State of the Kings Affairs are in your Neighbourhood I am obliged to you for your

   <P>Since my last of the 12th of July the Convention of this Colony have been Sitting where I am
      informed, they have had many differences, some for very violent Measures others for less
      violent; they are at last come to the resolutions contained in their proceedings here
      inclosed, the Substance of which is that they have appointed a Committee of Safety, as I
      understand to be held at Hanover Town, in the County of the same Name, consisting of the
      following Members Vizt The Honorable <name>John Page</name>, one of His Majesty's Council, Edmond
      Pendleton, Chairman of the Committee, <name>George Mason</name>, <name>Paul Carrington</name>, <name>James Mercer</name>, and Richard

      Luwell Lee, <name>William Cabell</name>, <name>Carter Braxton</name>, and <name>John Tabb</name>, Country Gentlemen. </P>
   <P>They have also ordered 1020 Regulars Rank and file with Officers in proportion to be
      immediately embodied, and these are to be Commanded by a certain <name>Patrick Henry</name>, who I informed
      your Lordship in a former letter (No 27) had robbed His Majesty's Receiver General. They have
      likewise ordered 425 Rifle Men, that is Hunters who make use of a Rifle instead of a Smooth
      bore Musket, these are intended to Act and def end them against the Indians, and are ordered
      to take possession of the three Posts I occupied last year on the Ohio, Vizt Fort Dunmore,
      Fort Fincastle, and Fort Pleasant at the Mouth of the great Kanahawa; and they have ordered
      8600 Minute Men, a term I am unacquainted with, which they have adopted from the New England
      Provinces . . . </P>
   <P>I have been informed that your Lordship, or some of His Majesty's Servants had intrusted a
      certain Mr [Thomas] Nelson [Jr.] (Son of Mr <name>Nelson President of His Majesty</name>'s Council and
      Secretary of this Colony) with some dispatches for me, which in place of delivering to me,
      when he arrived, (tho' I was within a few Miles of him) he carried to the Committee at
      Hampton, who refusing to receive them he then offered them to the Committee at York (the Town
      where his father resides) who also refusing to receive them, he has delivered them to the
      Committee of Safety, since which I have heard nothing of them. . . . </P>
   <P>I wait with great impatience for a full Answer to my former letters (Nos 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30
      ;) which I trust in God will releive me from the very dissagreeable Situation I now find
      myself in, Surrounded with Enemies, and Seeing them every day grow more formidable, both as to
      Numbers and discipline, without a Single instruction how to Act, or force to Annoy them; and
      what hurts me more than any thing, is to See those that I am sure, would most willingly have
      espoused His Majesty's interest, now bearing Arms against him, because they have no place of
      refuge to fly to; and I make no doubt, without, I am both enabled, and instructed to Act soon,
      that the Indians, whoes talk I send you, (No 5) as well as those whoes Address I here inclose
      (No. 6) to your Lordship, will, if not immediately employed in His Majesty's Service, take
      part with the Rebells. . . . </P>
   <P>As the People, who are continually applying to me for protection, will be obliged to join the
      Rebells, unless they have some place of refuge to fly to, I intend to take them on board the
      Ships, untill I receive instructions from your Lordship, in what manner I am to Act. . . . </P>

   <Title>NARRATIVE OF COLONEL <name>ETHAN ALLEN</name> 1</Title>
   <P>[Montreal, September 25]</P>
   <P>My whole party, at this time, consisted of about one hundred and ten men, near eighty of whom
      were Canadians. We were the most of the night crossing the river, as we had so few canoes that
      they had to pass and re-pass three times, to carry my party across. Soon after day-break, I
      set a guard between me and the town with special orders to let no person whatever pass or
      re-pass them, and another guard on the other end of the road, with like directions; in the
      mean time, I reconnoitered the best ground to make a defence, expecting Col. Brown's party was
      landed on the other side of the town, he having the day before, agreed to give three huzzas
      with his men early in the morning, which signal I was to return, that we might each know that
      both parties were landed; but the sun, by this time, being near two hours high, and the sign
      failing, I began to conclude myself to be in a premunire, and would have crossed the river
      back again, but I knew the enemy would have discovered such an attempt; and, as there could
      not more than one third part of my troops cross at one time, the other two thirds would of
      course fall into their hands. This I could not reconcile to my own feelings as a man, much
      less as an officer: I therefore concluded to maintain the ground, if possible, and all to fare
      alike. In consequence of this resolution, I dispatched two messengers, one to La Prairie, to
      Col. Brown, and the other to L' Assomption, a French settlement, to Mr. Walker, who was in our
      interest, requesting their speedy assistance, giving them, at the same time, to understand my
      critical situation: In the mean time, sundry persons came to my guards, pretending to be
      friends, but were by them taken prisoners and brought to me. These I ordered to confinement,
      till their friendship could be farther confirmed; for I was jealous they were spies, as they
      proved to be afterwards: One of the principal of them making his escape, exposed the weakness
      of my party, which was the final cause of my misfortune; for I have been since informed that
      Mr. Walker, agreeable to my desire, exerted himself, and had raised a considerable number of
      men for my assistance, which brought him into difficulty afterwards; but, upon hearing of my
      misfortune, he disbanded them again. </P>
   <P>The town of Montreal was in a great tumult. Gen. Carlton and the royal party, made every
      preparation to go on board their vessels of force, as I was afterwards informed, but the spy,
      escaping from my guard to the town, occasioned an alteration in their policy, and emboldened
      Gen. Carlton to send the force, which he had there collected, out against me. I had previously
      chosen my ground, but when I saw the number of the enemy, as they sallied out of the town, I
      perceived it would be a day of trouble, if not of rebuke; but I had no chance to flee, as
      Montreal was situated on an island, and the river St. Lawrence cut off my communication to
      Gen. Montgomery's camp. I encouraged my soldiery to bravely defend themselves, that we should
      soon have help, and that we should be able to keep the ground, if no more - This, and much
      more, I affirmed with the greatest seeming assurance, and which in reality I thought to be in
      some degree probable. </P>
   <P>The enemy consisted of not more than forty regular troops, together with a mixed multitude,
      chiefly Canadians, with a number of English who lived in the town, and some Indians; in all to
      the number of near five hundred. </P>
   <P>The reader will notice that most of my party were Canadians; indeed, it was a motley parcel of
      soldiery which composed both parties. However, the enemy began the attack from wood-piles,
      ditches, buildings, and such-like places, at a considerable distance, and I returned the fire
      from a situation more than equally advantageous. The attack began betw_een two and three of
      the clock in the afternoon, just before which I ordered a volunteer by the name of Richard
      Young, with a detachment of men as a flank guard, which, under the cover of the bank of the
      river, could not only annoy the enemy, but at the same time, serve as a flank guard to the
      left of the main body. </P>
   <P>The fire continued for some time on both sides; and I was confident that such a remote method
      of attack could not carry the ground, provided it should be continued till night: But near
      half of the body of the enemy began to flank round to my right; upon which I ordered a
      volunteer, by the name of <name>John Dugan</name>, who had lived many years in Canada, and understood the
      French language, to detach about fifty of the Canadians, and post himself at an advantageous
      ditch, which was on my right, to prevent my being surrounded: He advanced with the detachment,
      but, instead of occupying the post, made his escape, as did like wise Mr. Young upon the left,
      with their detachments. I soon perceived that the enemy was in possession of the ground, which
      Dugan should have occupied. At this time I had but about forty-five men with me, some of whom
      were wounded; the enemy kept closing round me, nor was it in my power to prevent it; by which
      means, my situation, which was advantageous in the first part of the attack, ceased to be so
      in the last, and, being almost entirely surrounded with such vast unequal numbers, I ordered a
      retreat, but found that those of the enemy who were of the country, and their Indians, could
      run as fast as my men, though the regulars could not. Thus I retreated near a mile, and some
      of the enemy, with the savages, kept flanking me, and others crowded hard in the rear. In
      fine, I expected, in a very short time, to try the world of spirits: for I was apprehensive
      that no quarter would be given to me, and therefore had determined to sell my Ii£ e as dear as
      I could. One of the enemy's officers, boldly pressing in the rear, discharged his fusee at me;
      the ball whistled near me, as did many others that day. I returned the salute, and missed him,
      as running had put us both out of breath; for I conclude we were not frightened; I then
      saluted him with my tongue in a harsh manner, and told him that, inasmuch as his numbers were
      so far superior to mine, I would surrender, provided I could be treated with honor, and be
      assured of good quarter for myself and the men who were with me; and he answered I should;
      another officer, coming up directly after, confirmed the treaty; upon which I agreed to
      surrender with my party, which then consisted of thirtyone effective men, and seven wounded. I
      ordered them to ground their arms, which they did. </P>
   <P>The officer I capitulated with, then directed me and my party to advance towards him,' which
      was done; I handed him my sword, and in half a minute after, a savage, part of whose head was
      shaved, being almost naked and painted, with feathers intermixed with the hair of the other
      side of his head, came running to me with an incredible swiftness; he seemed to advance with
      more than mortal speed; as he approached near me, his hellish visage was beyond all
      description; snakes' eyes appear innocent in comparison of his; his features distorted;
      malice, death, murder, and the wrath of devils and damned spirits are the emblems of his
      countenance; and, in less than twelve feet of me, presented his firelock; at the instant of
      his present, I twitched the officer, to whom I gave my sword, between me and the savage; but
      he flew round with great fury, trying to single me out to shoot me without killing the
      officer; but by this time I was near as nimble as he, keeping the officer in such a position
      that his danger was my defence; but, in less than half a minute, I was attacked by just such
      another imp of hell: Then I made the officer fly round with incredible velocity, for a few
      seconds of time, when I perceived a Canadian, who had lost one eye, as appeared afterwards,
      taking my part against the savages; and in an instant an Irishman came to my assistance with a
      fixed bayonet, and drove away the fiends, swearing by Jasus he would kill them. This tragic
      scene composed my mind. The escaping from so awful a death made even imprisonment happy; the
      more so as my conquerors on the field treated me with great civility and politeness. </P>
   <P>The regular officers said that they were very happy to see Col. Allen: I answered them, that I
      should rather chose to have seen them at Gen. Montgomery's camp. The gentlemen replied, that
      they gave full credit to what I said, and, as I walked to the town, which was, as I should
      guess, more than two miles, a British officer walking at my right hand, and one of the French
      noblesse at my left; the latter of which, in the action, had his eye brow carried away by a
      glancing shot, but was nevertheless very merry and facetious, and no abuse was offered me till
      I came to the barrack-yard, at Montreal, where I met general [Richard] Prescott, who asked me
      my name, which I told him: He then asked me, whether I was that Col. Allen who took
      Ticonderoga. I told him I was the very man: Then he shook his cane over my head, calling many
      hard names, among which he frequently used the word rebel, and put himself in a great rage. I
      told him he would do well not to cane me, for I was not accustomed to it, and shook my fist at
      him, telling him that was the beetle of mortality for him, if he offered to strike; upon which
      Capt. M'Cloud of the British, pulled him by the skirt and whispered to him, as he afterwards
      told me, to this import: that it was inconsistent with his honor to strike a prisoner. He then
      ordered a sergeant's command with fixed bayonets to come forward, and kill thirteen Canadians,
      which were included in the treaty aforesaid. </P>
   <P>It cut me to the heart to see the Canadians in so hard a case, in consequence of their' having
      been true to me; they were wringing their hands, saying their prayers, as I concluded, and
      expected immediate death. I therefore stepped between the executioners and the Canadians,
      opened my clothes, and told General Prescott to thrust his bayonet into my breast, for I was
      the sole cause of the Canadians taking up arms. </P>
   <P>The guard in the mean time, rolling their eye balls from the General to me, as though
      impatiently waiting his dread commands to sheath their bayonets in my heart; I could however
      plainly discern, that he was in a suspence and quandary about the matter: This gave me
      additional hopes of succeeding; for my design was not to die, but to save the Canadians by a
      finesse. The general stood a minute, when he made me the following reply: &quot;I will not
      execute you now, but you shall grace a halter at Tyburn, God damn you.&quot; </P>
   <P>I remember I disdained his mentioning such a place; I was, notwithstanding, a little pleased
      with the expression, as it significantly conveyed to me the idea of postponing the present
      appearance of death; besides, his sentence was by no means final, as to &quot;gracing a
      halter,&quot; although I had anxiety about it after I landed in England, as the reader will
      find in the course of this history. Gen. Prescott then ordered one of his officers to take me
      on board the Gaspee schooner of war, and confine me, hands and feet, in irons, which was done
      the same afternoon I was taken. </P>
   <P>The action continued an hour and three quarters, by the watch, and I know not to this day how
      many of my men were killed, though I am certain there were but few! if I remember right, seven
      were wounded; one of them, <name>William Stewart</name>, by name, was wounded by a savage with a tomahawk,
      after he was taken prisoner and disarmed, but was rescued by some of the generous enemy; and
      so far recovered of his wounds, that he afterwards went with the other prisoners to England. </P>
   <P>Of the enemy were killed, a Major Carden, who had been wounded in eleven different battles,
      and an eminent merchant, Patterson, of Montreal, and some others, but I never knew their whole
      loss, as their accounts were different. I am apprehensive that it is rare, that so much
      ammunition was expended, and so little execution done by it; though such of my party as stood
      the ground, behaved with great fortitude, much exceeding that of the enemy, but were not the
      best of marksmen, and, I am apprehensive, were all killed or taken; the wounded were all put
      into the hospital at Montreal, and those that were not, were put on board of different vessels
      in the river, and shackled together by pairs, viz. two men fastened together by one hand cuff,
      being closely fixed to one wrist of each of them, and treated with the greatest severity, nay
      as criminals. </P>
   <P>I now come to the description of the irons, which were put on me: The hand-cuff was of a
      common size and form, but my leg irons, I should imagine would weigh thirty pounds; the bar
      was eight feet long, and very substantial; the shackles which encompassed my ancles, were very
      tight. I was told by the officer who put them on, that it was the king's plate, and I heard
      other of their officers say that it would weigh forty weight. The irons were so close upon my
      ancles, that I could not lie down in any other manner than on my back. I was put into the
      lowest and most wretched part of the vessel, where I got the favor of a chest to sit on; the
      same answered for my bed at night; </P>

   <P>May it please your Excellency, </P>
   <P>My last of the 19th Inst. from Newbury Port, advising of the Embarkation of the Troops, I make
      no Doubt, your Excellency received. The same Day we left Newbury, and arrived safe in the
      River next Morning, except a small Vessel which run on the Rocks, but is since off, without
      Damage and arrived safe. I found the Batteaus compleated, but many of them smaller than the
      Directions given, and very badly built - of Course I have been obliged to order twenty more to
      bring on the Remainder of the Provisions which will be finished in three Days. Many of the
      Vessels were detained in the River by running aground, and head Winds, which delayed us a Day
      or two. The 23d Inst. I dispatched Lieut [Archibald] Steel of Capt. [Matthew] Smith's Company
      with 6 Men in two Birch Canoes to Chaudiere Pond to reconnoitre and get all the Intelligence
      he possibly could from the Indians who I find are hunting there. The same Day I dispatched
      Lieutt Church and seven Men with a Surveyor &amp; Pilot to take the Exact Courses and
      Distances to the Dead River so called, a Branch of the Kennebec, and yesterday the three
      Companies of Rifle-Men under the Command of Capt. [Daniel] Morgan embarked with forty five
      Days Provisions as an advanced Party to clear the Roads over the carrying Places. Col: Green
      [<name>Christopher Greene</name>] &amp; Major [Timothy] Bigelow march today with the second Division of
      three Companies. Major Meggs [Return <name>Jonathan Meigs</name>] goes off tomorrow with the third
      Division, and Col: [Roger] Enos the next Day, with the Remainder. </P>
   <P>As soon as the whole are embarked, I propose taking a Birch Canoe, and joining the advanced
      Party. I have found it necessary to divide the Detachment for the Conveniency of passing the
      Carrying the [sic] Places, at the first of which there are some Carriages to be procured. I
      design Chaudiere Pond as a general Rendesvouze, and from thence to march in a Body. </P>
   <P>Inclosed is a Letter to Mr Coburn, from the Party sent to Quebec, by which your Excellency
      will see all the Intelligence I have received. I have conversed with the Party, who saw only
      one Indian, one Nattaries, a Native of Norridgwalk, a noted Villain, and very little Credit, I
      am told is to be given to his Information. </P>
   <P>The Indians with Higgens set out by Land, and are not yet arrived. I have engaged a Number of
      good Pilots, and believe by the best Information I can procure, we shall be able to perform
      the March in twenty Days. The Distance about 180 Miles. </P>
   <P>I intended Col: Green should have gone on with the first Division of one Company of Rifle-men,
      and two Companies of Musketeers. This was objected to by the Captains of the Rifle-Companies,
      who insist on being commanded by no other Person than Capt. Morgan and myself. This Capt.
      Morgan tells me was your Excellency's Intention. But as I was not made acquainted with it
      before I came away, I should be very glad of particular Instructions on that Head, that I may
      give Satisfaction to the Field Officers with me. There is at present the greatest Harmony
      among the Officers, and no Accident happened, except the Loss of one Man; supposed to be
      wilfully shot by a private, who is now taking his Trial by a Court Martial. </P>
   <P>Major [Thomas] Mifflin could not send Money for the Batteaus, the Commissary has been obliged
      to pay for them with one Hundred Pounds I have lent him, out of the Pay received for the Month
      of Sepr, and has been obliged to draw an Order in Favour of the Bearer Mr <name>John Wood</name> who has
      engaged to deliver this to your Excellency. I have promised him his Time &amp; Expences paid.
      I should be glad the Manifestoes might be forwarded by him if not sent by the last
      Intelligence from <name>Genl Schuyler</name>, to whom I intend sending one of the Indians as soon as they
      arrive.</P>

   <P>P.S. Since writing the foregoing I have received a Letter from Col: [Joseph] Reed with the
      Manifesto's - and the Court Martial have condemned the Man who shot the other to be hanged,
      which Sentence I have approved, but have respited him, until your Excellency Pleasure in the
      Matter be known, and design sending him back in one of the Transports. Enclosed are all the
      Papers relative to the Matter, with his Confession at the Gallows before respited. </P>

   <P>[New York] Die Lunae 9 HO. A.M. September 25th, 1775.</P>
   <P><name>Francis James</name>, one of the pilots sent out by order of the [Provincial] Congress to observe any
      fleet that might be approaching any part of this Colony, being returned, gave information that
      on the 21st inst. they saw several ships, which came out of Boston harbour, steering westward,
      and the journal kept on board, was delivered in and filed. Thereupon a letter to the committee
      of East and SouthHampton, was read and approved, and is in the words following, to wit:</P>
   <P>In Committee of Safety For the Colony of New-York,</P>
   <P>September 25th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Gentlemen - One of our boats (employed to watch the motions of the fleet and army at Boston,)
      is just arrived from the eastward, and informs us, that on the 21st inst. in the morning, off
      the harbour of Chatham, near Cape Cod, they saw a large ship of war standing to the westward;
      and about three hours after, they saw four ships, one brig and 1 schooner, all standing the
      same course, over the shoals. Our boatmen could not, with any safety, go near enough to make a
      perfect discovery, but we apprehend they are part of a fleet destined for Suffolk county, for
      the purpose of getting more stock. We give you this notice to the end that you may be prepared
      to protect the stock and prevent their being taken off, if possible ... Please send copies of
      this by express, to the committees of Southhold and Shelter island.</P>

      is in the words following, to wit:</P>
   <P>Gentlemen of the Committee of Safety:</P>
   <P>Sirs: Our petition of the 21st 2 of this month, wherein was contained our grievances, we fear
      is not come to your hands, wherefore we take this opportunity to acquaint you, gentlemen, of
      our distress. We have already been confined three weeks, and the reason of it is, we hear,
      that you have sent for evidence to our parts, which we think is a sufficient time for such
      evidence to have been here, if there was any. Gentlemen, we beg you would consider our case as
      your own, and do by others as you would be done by, for therein a man fulfilleth the law of
      God. We will endeavour to set forth the unhappy condition we are in, confined to a room, which
      indeed we think a great hardship; spending our money at a great rate, more than our ability
      will allow; deprived from our business and our families, and our children are not yet capable
      of maintaining themselves; there are no less than twenty-one children belonging to three of us
      here confined, and the eldest not exceeding twelve years. Besides, the Esopus people have took
      Christian and <name>Adam Bergh</name>'s sloop from their landing, and, as we are credibly informed, have
      sold her for the use of the Congress, and God knows whether they have not stripped their
      families of all; Dop's sloop is burned, with a great many of our wearing apparel; all which
      has been done before we are brought to trial, and before it is known whether we are guilty of
      any crime; and, farther, we all have taken very bad colds. If the witnesses have not yet come,
      we beg you would bring us before you as soon as these shall come to your hands; possibly we
      may give you satisfaction ourselves.</P>

   <P>1775 Monday. Sept. 24 [i.e. 25].</P>
   <P>An Uneasiness, among some of the Members concerning a Contract with Willing &amp; Morris, for
      Powder, by which the House, without any Risque at all will make a clear Profit of 12,000£ at
      least.</P>
   <P>Dyer and Deane spoke in public, Lewis to me in private about it. All think it exorbitant. </P>
   <P><name>S. Adams</name> desired that the Resolve of Congress, upon which the Contract was founded might be
      read: he did not recollect it. </P>
   <P><name>De Hart</name>. One of the Contractors, Willing, declared to this Congress that he looked upon the
      Contract to be that the first Cost should be insured to them, not the 14£ a Barrell for the
      Powder. </P>
   <P><name>R. <name>R. Livingston</name></name>. I never will vote to ratify the Contract in the sense that Morris
      understands it. </P>
   <P>Willing. I am a Member of the House, a Party to the Contract, but was not privy to the
      Bargain. I never saw the Contract, untill I saw it in Dr. <name>Franklins Hand</name>. I think it ensures
      only the first Cost. My Partner thinks it ensures the whole. He says that Mr. Rutledge said at
      the Time, that Congress should have nothing to do with Sea risque. The Committee of this City
      offered 19£. I would wish to have nothing to do with the Contract: but to leave it to my
      Partner, who is a Man of Reason and Generosity, to explain the Contract with the Gentlemen who
      made it with him. </P>
   <P><name>J. Rutledge</name>. Congress was to run no Risque only vs. Men of War and Customhouse officers. I was
      surprized this Morning to hear that Mr. Morris understood it otherwise. If he wont execute a
      Bond, such as We shall draw, I shall not be at a loss what to do . </P>
   <P>Johnson. An hundred Ton of Powder was wanted. </P>
   <P>Ross. In Case of its Arrival Congress was to pay £14. If Men of War, or Custom house officers,
      should get it, Congress was to pay first Cost only as I understood it. </P>
   <P>Zubly. We are highly favoured. 14£ We are to give if We get the Powder: and 14£ if We dont get
      it. I understand Persons enough will contract to supply Powder at 15£ and run all risques. </P>
   <P>Willing. Sorry any Gentlemen should be severe. Mr. Morris's Character is such that he cannot
      deserve it.</P>
   <P>Lynch. If Morris will execute the Bond, well, if not the Committee will report.</P>
   <P>Deane. It is very well that this matter has been moved and that so much has been said upon it. </P>
   <P>Dyer. There are not Ten Men in the Colony I come from, who are worth so much Money as will be
      made clear by this Contract. </P>
   <P>Ross. What has this Matter to [do with] the present debate, whether Connecticutt Men are worth
      much or no. It proves there are no Men there whose Capital or Credit are equal to such
      Contracts. That is all. </P>
   <P>Harrison. The Contract is made and the Money paid. How can We get it back? </P>
   <P>Johnson. Let us consider the Prudence of this Contract. If it had not been made Morris would
      have got 19£, and not have set forward a second Adventure. </P>
   <P>Gadsden. Understands the Contract as Morris does, and yet thinks it a prudent one, because
      Morris would have got 19£. </P>

   <P>Yours of the 17th July lays now before us. it not a little astonishes us that your friends
      think we charge more than the real Cost of the Corn, however they are unacquainted with us,
      perhaps if they were not, they would think otherwise. to Satisfy them we inclose you Mr
      [Jonathan] Hudson's Accot of the Corn &amp; Mess Vanbibber &amp; Crockets Coroboration [Sic]
      of the then existing prices. as to the Quotation of the Philada price we know nothing. it
      would not be amiss to examin[e] what was the real Cost from that place. however that is
      immaterial to us. thus far we have to assure you that it was bot on the lowest terms, for what
      was Shipp'd by Messr V &amp; Co was bot on Shore &amp; an Ex pence of 1 ½d p B [ushel]
      attended the reshipping. 'twas but a trifling Affair we Shippd it purely to oblige you as we
      made Sure of losing at least our Commissions. you mention Your friends being largely embark'd
      in the Corn Trade &amp; that it will be our Interest to cultivate their friendship. we Shall
      be glad to receive the Commands of our friends but see no Means to do Business where our
      Honour is the least Suspected. We shall be well pleasd to hear that the Union proceeded to
      Lisbon, as the prices were very good there. 2</P>

   <P>A Copy</P>

   <P>Sir.</P>
   <P>I have the honour to receive your Letter of 30th Augt by Capt. [<name>Francis Grant</name>] Gordon,
      Commander of His Majestys' Ship Argo, to acquaint me that you have certain intelligence, that
      several Vessels belonging to North America, go to the Dutch French, &amp; Spanish Islands in
      these Seas, and offer unlimited prices for Gunpowder &amp; other Warlike Stores; and that you
      are apprehensive that many of the North American Vessels, which trade to His Majestys'
      Caribbee Islands, may use the like endeavours to purchase Gunpowder &amp;c. in these Islands
      and that the great prices offered may tempt private adventurers to run risks, to the great
      detriment of His Majestys' Service, at a time when the North Americans are in open
      rebellion.</P>
   <P>To prevent any pernicious Trafick of this nature, in this Island, I will, in compliance with
      your request, immediately issue a proclamation to forbid. the shipping Gunpowder, or other
      Warlike Stores, either Coastwise, or otherwise, by any Ships or Vessels whatever for the Space
      of Six months; and I will take the first opportunity of laying your Letter before His
      Majesty's Council of this Island, for their advice what other steps may be necessary to be
      taken, to prevent such projects. But I do not apprehend that there is or has been for any time
      past any considerable quantity of Powder in private hands here; however it may prevent any
      future Speculations of this kind.</P>
   <P>I received yesterday a Letter from Mr Bruyere, Governor of Bermudas, a Copy of which I think
      it right to send you, though I understand the same person who brought mine delivered a Letter
      likewise to Captain Gordon. The man who brought it seems either very much frightened, or
      disturbed in his brain; I could not make head or tail of his verbal Account, only that the
      whole Island was in a State of Rebellion. The Governor's Letter does not intimate so much,
      only that the Scheme of carrying away the Powder was formed by a correspondence between some
      few of the Island and those on the Continent. But it shews to what length the North Americans
      are disposed to go in their wicked pursuits, I have the honour to be Sir [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 26 Sepr 1775.</P>
   <P>On the 8th instant the Savage put back with three Vessels seized under the restraining Act for
      the Northern Colonies. On the 10th the Hope and <name>St Lawrence</name> Schooners arrived from the Bay of
      Fundy with a Convoy of Transports with forage for the Army.</P>
   <P>Governor Carleton applied to me some time in July last for two of his Majestys Sloops of War,
      and an additional Number of Shipwrights and Seamen, in order to build Vessels and regain the
      Navigation of the Lakes and drive out the Rebels, who had invaded the province of Canada. I
      was under the necessity of acquainting his Excellency that it was then entirely out of my
      power to assist him. General Carleton has since picked up the Gaspee, and on the Hunters
      Arrival I immediately determined to lend that Sloop to him also, but the Head of her foremast
      being sprung, and she wanting other repairs besides a new Mast, she did not sail till the 12th
      instant. I have given Captain Mackenzie Orders to proceed without a moments loss of time to
      Quebec, and there co-operate with and assist Governor Carleton to the utmost of his power
      against the Rebels, to take the Gaspee under his Command, and to remain in the River St
      Lawrence until further orders. The Savage sailed the same time for Halifax.</P>
   <P>I inclose the Sentence of a Court Martial held the 11th instant on Captain Collins, whom I
      instantly restored to the Command of the Nautilus. I cannot avoid expressing my disapprobation
      of the Court, considering mulcting an Officer for breach of Orders, where there has been no
      peculation, to be an improper Punishment. And it will give me Satisfaction, if their
      Lordships, viewing this Matter in the same light, are pleased to indulge me with remitting the
      Fine.</P>
   <P>The four New England Governments being absolutely at War with us, it is no longer safe to
      attempt carrying on the Survey under the direction of Captain [Samuel] Holland, and
      apprehending that gentleman and those employed under him, with their Plans, Charts and
      Instruments &amp;ca to be in great danger of being seized by the Rebels, Notwithstanding their
      Labours are for the general good of Mankind, I have wrote to Captain Holland at Perth Amboy,
      and directed him to put the abovementioned Articles on board the Asia for Security; I have
      directed Captain Vandeput to receive all the Surveyors on board the Asia if they desire it;
      and, as soon as I hear from Captain Holland, I shall order those borne on the Canceaux's Books
      to be discharged. </P>
   <P>I received a Letter from Captain Vandeput the 9th instant, to which I returned an Answer next
      day, I inclose an extract of Captain <name>Vandeputs Letter</name> and a Copy of my Answer. </P>
   <P>Having been obliged to send the Kingsfisher. to Virginia I ordered Captain Pryce on the Viper
      on the 13th instant to proceed over the Shoals with a Transport to Rhode Island, and, leaving
      her with Captain Wallace, to go on through the Sound to New York, and put himself under the
      Command of Captain Vandeput, He accordingly fell down to Nantasket the 13th. By the Viper I
      sent Orders to Captain Wallace to put the supernumerary Marines and Seamen on board the Rose
      and Glasgow into the Swan, and to send that Sloop with them to Boston. I have ordered
      Lieutenant <name>Thomas Graves</name> in the <name>Bolton Brig</name> to pi.It himself under the Command of Captain
      Wallace, and to sail with another Transport in Company of the Viper. </P>
   <P>I transmit an Extract of a Letter from General Gage expressing his desire for a Schooner to go
      to St Augustine. I immediately appointed the <name>St Lawrence</name> to that Service. </P>
   <P>On the 14th I ordered Captain Vandeput strictly to watch the Ferries from New York to the
      Jerseys and Long Island, and endeavour to seize any of the Delegates to the Congress, the
      Rebel General Officers, and most active abettors of the Rebellion of what Degree soever. Their
      Lordships may probably desire to know the general Tenor of my Orders respecting the Rebels, to
      the Captains of the Squadron, I therefore inclose a Copy of those given the 22d August to the
      Honorable Captain Tollemache upon his going to North Carolina; and of the 17th of September to
      Captain Collins of the Nautilus on his return to the Delaware; The same day I ordered Capt.
      Wallace not only to take or destroy Rebels at Sea, but to lay waste and set fire to those
      Towns on the Sea Coast that shelter pyrates, or from whence any are fitted out, constantly
      protecting and def ending his .Majesty's faithful Subjects and their property where ever they
      can be distinguished. </P>
   <P>The Wind blowing easterly prevented the Viper, Bolton, and Transports from sailing according
      to their Orders. On the 17th at Night I received a Letter from Captain Pryce of his Majesty's
      Sloop Viper, a Copy of which is inclosed. In consequence whereof I ordered the Surgeons of his
      Majesty's Ships that happened to be at N antasket to examine Captain Pryce; I transmit a Copy
      of their Report. Being myself perfectly satisfied of his Unfitness to serve from great age and
      infirmities, I consented to his quitting the Command of the Viper, the present Juncture
      requiring active men capable of bearing the Fatigue of those Vessels. </P>
   <P>I have already acquainted you in my Letter August 17th that Lieut. <name>Graeme of the Preston</name> was
      sent to put Captain Macartney in Arrest, and to command the Mercury by order; that Ship not
      being arrived, and the Viper detained only by contrary Winds from sailing with &quot;Orders of
      great Consequence to Captains Wallace and Vandeput, and that Sloop being also much wanted with
      the Asia at New York; I thought it would in all events be best for the Kings Service to
      appoint a Commander to her, I therefore gave a Commission to my Nephew Lieut. .<name>Samuel Graves</name>
      of the Preston. But as I am well apprized of the irregu larity of this measure, I beg leave to
      observe that I should not have put in the second Lieutenant of the Preston, had I not been
      certain of a Vacancy for the first; the Charge against Captain Macartney being of that nature
      not to be tried abroad with Satisfaction to all parties, nor without great Detriment to the
      Kings Service. I beg, Sir, you will be so good to rep~esent to their Lordships that I do not
      mean by this appointment ta: establish a precedent, and that I shall strictly observe the
      Regµlations they have been pleased to make; but that in truth, considering this Step to be
      most advantageous to the Kings Service, I have ven tured upon it; and I shall hold myself
      under very great Obligations to their Lord ships, if they are pleased to confirm my Nephew's
      Appointment to the Viper.</P>
   <P>I have appointed Mr <name>Edward Sneyd</name> Midshipman on board the Preston to be third Lieutenant of
      her, and removed the former third Lieutenant to second.</P>
   <P>I inclose a Copy of a Letter to me from Captain Wallace and of the papers referred to therein.
      I cannot sufficiently express my Satisfaction with his Alertness and Zeal for the Cause of his
      Country against the Rebels. I have sent the <name>Bolton Brig</name> to him with a few Howitzers &amp;c,
      acquainting him at the same time that he must not suffer the New Londoners to carry off the
      Schooner and Hay with impunity. I flatter myself the Connecticutians will soon repent the
      preferring to make War against their Sovereign rather than continuing peaceable and obedient
      If I am erring in pursuing, as far as I can, severe measures against his Majesty's rebellious
      Subjects, I hope it will appear they have not been hastily adopted; that the losses his
      Majesty's Squadron and Army have already suffered, and the determination of the Rebels to
      destroy us at all opportunities, do fully justify the most rigorous punishment that can be
      inflicted; and that I cannot in conscience do otherwise consistent with my Duty to his Majesty
      and my Country.</P>
   <P>Governor Wentworth desiring to be landed in any part within his Govern ment, to prorogue the
      General Assembly of the Province of New Hampshire, sailed the 20th instant in the Hope
      Schooner to the Isle of Shoals, from whence his Excellency returned to Boston this day, and
      Lieutenant [Georgej I)awson brought with him two Vessels seized for coasting contrary to Law. </P>
   <P>Ten Sail of Transports being got ready to go to Penobscot Bay to get fuel for the Garrison;
      upon the Generals application for Convoy to them I appointed the Lively; but one Ship not
      being thought sufficient the General armed the Spy Transport, and a Sloop: On board the first
      I have put a Lieutenant, two Midshipmen and 19 Men from the Boyne, and manned. the Sloop out
      of the other Ships. On the 20th the Lively sailed with this Convoy; together with the
      Nautilus, Viper, Bolton, <name>St Lawrence</name> and Halifax; and the Transports for Rhode Island. </P>
   <P>Finding the people of Great Britain and Ireland continue migrating to the Colonies, and the
      Kings Army here being in want of Recruits, I directed Captain Vandeput by an Order dated the
      24th instant upon the arrival of any Ship or Vessel at New York with Emigrants from Great
      Britain or Ireland not to suffer one of them to land, but to send the Ship or Vessel round to
      Boston. </P>
   <P>The Charlotte hired Sloop sailed the 24th with Dispatches to the Southward. </P>

   <P>Providence September 26th 1775.</P>
   <P>In consequence of your Letter of the 18th instant we have sent our small armed Vessel with
      Orders to Capt. [Abraham] Whipple to relinquish the Voyage to Bermuda, and to prolong his
      Cruise for the Packet to the Sixth Day of October.</P>
   <P>Agreeable to your advise I have communicated the proposed Adventure to Bayonne to the
      [Continental] Congress, and most heartily wish it may be pursued, as the Ability and Integrity
      of <name>Du Ville</name> are perfectly relied upon here. - The following Extract from <name>Govr Trumbull</name>'s
      Letter to me of the 18th instant will inform you of his Sentiments respecting the Enterprise,
      and of his Reasons for declining to take a Part in it, - &quot;In mine of the 11th instt in
      Answer to your esteemed Favour of the 9th I acquainted you with my purpose to lay your Letter
      before my Council on Thursday the, 14. which I did. They approve your Proposition,. the Way
      appears to them promising. At the same time we have advanced Money so largely for that
      Article, and have great Reason to expect a Supply in a similar Method, that they judge it not
      expedient for us to proceed farther at this Time. It is an Article that requires our
      Attention, and wish every Method that appears - probable to obtain it may be pursued. I hope
      General Washington will hearken to your Application, and suitably encourage and promote your
      generous Design.&quot;</P>
   <P>. . . Since the sailing of the small Vessel I observe in the New Yark Paper that a Packet is
      arrived there from Falmouth which I take it to be the same that Capt. Whipple was sent after.
      If so the Opportunity is lost; but by extending his cruise a little longer he may have a
      Chance for the August packet. </P>

   <P>Your Favour of the 18th instant hath been duly received. In Compliance with which I give you
      the following Extract from General Washington's Letter to me of the same Date. &quot;The
      Voyage to Bayonne is what I should much approve and recommend. The Person sent to Gov.
      Trumbull hath not yet called upon me; but the Scheme appears so f easable that I should be
      glad to see it executed. At the same Time I must add that I am _in some Doubt as to the Extent
      of my Powers to appropriate the publick Monies here to this Purpose. I could wish you would
      communicate it to the [Continental] Congress for which you'll have Time sufficient and I make
      no Doubt of their Concurrence.' In Fact the State of our Treasury here is so low that it would
      be impracticable to be of any Service to the Expedition, if all other Objections were
      obviated&quot; - I have accordingly laid the Proposal before the Congress.</P>

   <P>Yesterday I put the Question after three hours debate for Stopping the Ship &amp; Lawford's
      Channel's by means of Sinking Schooners, &amp; it was carried in the affirmative 32 against
      14. - I could not have thought after the clear &amp; Sensible declarations made by Capt Thos.
      Tucker who twice Surveyed the breadth &amp; depth of each Channel that so great a Majority
      would have been found in favour of a measure which he &amp; many other Skilful Men have
      declared, will prove ineffectual &amp; will be attended with a vast expence &amp; which had
      been in May or June last [been] discountenanced by a much larger Majority - I Said nothing
      till the Question had been put &amp; carried - then I observed that although so great a
      Majority had appeared for the Question, I was not ashamed to own that I remained in my former
      opinion, that I had listned to the debates with great attention but had heard nothing new,
      nothing [&amp;] nothing that would induce me to alter my Sentiments - that if the Barr Should
      be effectually Stoped up, this Town &amp; the most valuable part of. the Country would be
      ruined, if ineffectually, the projectors , would be Standing Subjects for ridicule &amp;
      contempt - that the effectual Stopping the Bar besides vastly depreciating the value of our
      Lands would not protect us against the Arm of England if She was Seriously disposed to Stretch
      it over us that many of these who had Spoke &amp; more who had Voted for the Measure had
      judged as blind Men do of Colours - I Should rejoice to find my Self mistaken in my own
      judgement, but that as the history of so important an Act would be transmitted through the
      World &amp; to posterity I was desirous that it Should be known ( although I was not obliged
      to give my Vote) on which Side of the ques- tion I had been - I was desirous also that my
      Children Should. - ~now it &amp; finally that however I might appear from Such declarations to
      be an Adversary the Committee Should find me a generous one - I would not oppose the question
      of the project Since it had been Resolved upon by a Majority. - but that I could not believe
      the people at large would be pleased with it. -</P>
   <P>Now for the execution of this mighty work - a Committee is appointed among whom are the most
      Strenuous votaries - Mr Tenant, Mr. Jno. Edwards &amp; Collo [George Gabriel] Powell, with
      three or four others whose Names I cannot recollect - it behoves them at least to make Some
      attempt, but already the good Parson Says the Council of Safety must first take the Man of War
      which lies in Rebellion Road - in aword I believe he had not Sat down &amp; counted the Cost
      nor had he well considered consequences before he had determined upon the measure &amp; that
      it will like many other of his Schemes fall to the Ground. -</P>
   <P>I am just returned from General Commee. after a-sitting from ½ past 8 to </P>
   <P>near 3 oClock - three Hours of the time was Spent on a Motion that the general Commee. do
      Resolve that it is necessary to authorize the. Commee for Stopping up the Ship &amp; Lawfords,
      Channels to take destroy or drive away the Ships of War near Sullivan ts Island - the Sub
      Commee had represented the impracticability of carrying the first intended measure into
      execution while those Ships lay there after much debate I put the question - which was lost 33
      to 16 - down went the Remora 2 as the parson calls it, to the Channels &amp; up went his
      passions &amp; Ill breeding - Gentlemen who were against the measure for attacking the Man of
      War, consented to Submit the Subject to a new Debate on Friday - this is a kind of sporting
      which is not warranted by good Sense or Sound policy - If the proposed measure was a good one,
      it ought not to have been opposed - if bad - it ought not to have the chance of a Second
      experiment - this Strange versatility confirms my observations that many had judged of the
      Scheme as blind Men do of Colours &amp; that we were reduced to the circumstances of Boys who
      had wantonly embarked in a Boat &amp; launched into deep Water without a paddle - if the
      proposition for attacking the Men of War Should be agreed to, upon a reconsideration on
      Friday, I very much doubt whether the Resolution will be carried into effect-if a Serious
      attempt is made there will be bloody work - the Tamar is as well prepared as Such a Crazy Boat
      can be - the Cherokee is fitted for defence &amp; so is a fine Schooner which the Man of War
      lately Seized for that very purpose. </P>
   <P>We have just received intelligence that the Georgians have Seized Seven Thousand pounds of Gun
      Powder on board of Rainiers Vessel for the use of the Colonies -</P>

   <P>Dear Sir</P>
   <P>The Camp at Point Olivie near Chamblee Sepr 27th 1775.</P>
   <P>I have sent you four Men who will engage to bring two or three Pieces of Cannon down the
      Rapids in a Batteau at Night. This is of great Consequence, and while you are bombarding the
      Fort at <name>St Johns</name> we may do the like at Chamblee. A small Guard might be sent to Mr Hazens
      [<name>Moses Hazen</name>] in Case they should be attacked by Batteaus from <name>St Johns</name>. Col. Allen crossed
      over from Lingale the Day before yesterday to attack the Town with a Party of his Men &amp;
      Canadians. <name>Genl Prescott</name> hearing of his coming engaged a Number of People from the suburbs at
      a Half Joha a Man to go out agt Allen. They met near a League from Town where a smart
      Engagement insued, which lasted upwards of two Hours. _They had two Field Pieces, and our
      Party after a long Engagement were obliged to retire, tho the Enemy by all Accounts came off
      second best. I have sent of[f] Mr Ohara [<name>Henry O'Hara</name>] Express to Longale to learn the true
      State of this Battle. The Canadians that have returned to me from the Battle agree in general
      that Mr Allen is either dead or taken Prisoner. This, if true, is a Blow upon us. Tomorrow we
      propose to have a Consultation at Longale. Our greatest Misfortune is the Want of Ammunition
      Mr Allen should never have attempted to attack the Town without my Knowledge, or acquainting
      me of his Design, as I had it in my Power to furnish him with a Number of Men. This Retreat of
      our Men may be a Hurt to us and weaken our Party. I have just sent down the River for a
      Reinforcement, and will keep them ready against the Arrival of your Cannon. I could wish to
      make a bold Push agt the Town, tho Nothing can be done without Cannon. I hope your Batteries
      are ready to play against <name>St Johns</name> by this Time. If you write to the Congress soon, you will
      be kind enough to recommend me to them as your Goodness may direct you. When-ever my Country
      calls upon me to its Assistance, I shall be always ready to do my Duty. I could wish this
      Province was already united to the others, and can't expect much Peace till that takes Place.
      I am with greatest Esteem yours &amp;c </P>

   <P>You are hereby directed to take Command of the Batteries on Pierce's &amp; Sevey's Islands and
      keep a constant Guard at each with your Company, taking Care to exercise them in the handling
      &amp; management of Cannon &amp; such other Exercises as you shall think necessary to make
      them Capable of doing their Duty at said Fortifications. You are not to suffer any Vessel to
      pass said Fortifications up the River without a Permit from the Committee of Safety of
      Portsmouth, except such Vessels as you are satisfied are only on a fair Trade. And if any
      armed Vessel shall attempt to pass without such permit, you are to prevent the Same by firing
      upon &amp; destr.oyin'g Such V_essel if necessary. But in all Cases where time will admit of
      taking the advice of the said Committee of Portsmouth, you are to do it, and not fire on any
      Vessel that shall come into the Harbour without their advice &amp; Consent if you have Time to
      obtain the Same. </P>

   <P>NEWBURYPORT COMMITTEE OF SAFETY TO THE MASSACHUSETTS PROVINCIAL </P>
   <P>CONGRESS1</P>
   <P>The Committee of Safety for the Town of Newbury Port, beg Leave to represent, that the Harbour
      of this Town, is so obstructed by Nature, &amp; so blocked up by certain Piers, which have
      been sunk at the _Mouth of it, that it is fitted for, &amp; is already become an Assylum for
      many Vessells, who seek to avoid the Piratical Ships of our Enemies: Yet as there are many
      small armed Vessells, which are cruising along all the shores of the Province, &amp;
      frequently crossing this Bay: many Vessells some loaded with Provissions, &amp; some with Fuel
      &amp; Lumber, have been taken before they coud reach the Mouth of this Harbour, &amp; sent to
      Boston, this we humbly conceive might in a great Measure be prevented, &amp; this Bay, as well
      as Harbour, be safe from these depredations, if an Armed Vessell, was stationed in this River,
      which shou'd occasionally Cruise from <name>Cape Ann</name>, to <name>Cape Elizabeth</name>: many other Advantages cou'd
      arise from such a Guard to this Part of the Coast; it would be a great security to the several
      Harbours, between the two Capes beforementioned, for by sometimes taking a Station at the Isle
      of Shoals, she wou'd command most of these Harbours &amp; prevent their being annoy'd, by
      Vessells belonging to the Enemy, unless they were of superior Force; &amp; we think we may add
      too, without Vaunting of much superior Force, New large Vessells of Force, cannot come very
      near this, &amp; some other Harbours in this Bay, without great Hazard, nor can their Stay, be
      of any Continuance, so that the Risque from them, wou'd be small &amp;doubtless many more
      Vessells from our Friends in the other Governments, wou'd visit us, than now do - some Powder
      Vessells, are already expected here, others wou'd go for the same Purpose, if this Measure
      took Place - large Quantities of Lumber, Flour &amp; Grain might conveniently &amp; safely be
      bro't here, for the use of the Army, &amp; perhaps they might be supplied thro' this Course,
      with more Ease, safety &amp; Convenience, &amp; with less Expence than thro' any other Channel </P>
   <P>The said Committee, woud further represent to your Honours, that impressed with these Ideas,
      the Inhabitants of this Town, are ready to engage in such an Undertaking - It is not in their
      Power to fit out &amp; employ a Vessell of sufficient Force, at their own Expence, they have
      already greatly exerted themselves, in their own Defence, &amp; in the common Cause, the
      Mercantile Part of the Town, only, will receive a Peculiar Benefit, &amp; that as their
      foreign Commerce is cut off, in a small Proportion to the Public - buf we will be at all the
      Trouble attending it; we can procure a Vessell, &amp; Commander &amp; Men on suitable
      Encouragement &amp; there are now in the pay of the Government, two Companies stationed in the
      Towns of Newbury &amp; Newbury Port, out of which Companies, it is probable, a large Part of
      the necessary Complement wou'd readily engage. - &amp; we can also find, if necessary eight or
      ten Carriage Guns, a number of Swivels, &amp; a small Quantity of Powder &amp; Provissions -
      the Committee, with the Leave of the Court, attend to, &amp; Direct the Motions of such a
      Vessell, so that she shall neither remain inactive, nor run into needless Danger. - Upon the
      whole, we beg leave to submit this our Proposal, to your wise Consideration, trusting that we
      will at least stand excused, for our good Intentions, &amp; as in Duty bound, will ever Pray

      about Kennebeck, or Mechias to try to Augment their Force, and to procure more Boats, to land

   <P>According to your Resolves, the Pilots belonging to Cape Henlopen, have laid up their Boats,
      and are determined not to brake through them; if you will make the Pilots of Philadelphia doe
      the same, for it is very hard to see your Pilots come down and take the Bread out of their
      mouths, for as long as you admit them to fetch their Boats with them, they will do the like;
      we are informed that there are some of them that are determined to look out as usual,
      therefore we pray that you would take our case in hand, and lay some further Restriction on
      them; we are very sorry that we are obliged to trouble you, but hope that the case will be a
      sufficient Excuse.</P>

   <P>Illustrious Patriots./</P>
   <P>If the most pressing necessity shall not be deemed a sufficient apology for the singularity of
      this address; I own myself unable to make any; and must submit to your censure. -</P>
   <P>Perhaps it may be no easy task to determine why the unhappy are solicitous to conceal their
      infelicity; but certain it is, that this Propensity is so powerful; where any degree of
      delicacy presides in the mind: that every Person in the least acquainted with the human heart
      must be thoroughly convin'd of its distress when compel'd to proclaim it. -</P>
   <P>It is of but little consequence: Gentlemen for you to be inform'd that in the early part of my
      life I quit the Land of my nativity, and pass'd a number of years in the West Indies; where
      the desire of independence enabled me to combat all the infirmities peculiar to that fatal
      Climate, till persevering diligence in the practice of medicine, had put me in possession of
      (what I tho't) a modest sufficiency for every future Care. -</P>
   <P>My unambitious views being thus satisfied, and the distresses which began to threaten my
      native Country (to which I feel every faculty of my soul indissolubly united [)] determined me
      to return &amp; share its destiny. - Accordingly all my property was shiped at different
      times, and on different Bottoms to North America, in one of which I took Passage myself; and
      after a most miserable &amp; length[y] Voiage replete with inexpressible hazard and hardship I
      arrived at Boston a few days before General Gage; where I received the Melancholy news, that
      by ship-wreck &amp; some other accidents to which Maritime affairs. are liable, almost every
      shilling of my hard earn'd acquisitions was utterly lost. -</P>
   <P>With a heavy &amp; almost disponding heart, I proceeded to New Jersey where I have two
      Children; and after spending some time with them, resolved to try my fortune once more among
      the Islands; in pursuance of this resolution on the 20th of March, I took shipping at New York
      &amp; Eleven days after was cast away at Cape Hatteras; from whence with much difficulty I got
      to Georgia; and being depriv'd by this accident of the very inconsiderable all, sav'd from my
      former misfortunes, have not had it in my Power to make a second attempt; and Consequently
      have ever since been a distitute unhappy Wanderer, without a home. </P>
   <P>But the laudable preperations which are making for the preservation &amp; defence of every
      sacred and valuable enjoyment, gives me leave to hope I may be yet rendered useful to society;
      and not intirely thrown by in the meridian of life, as a Worthless member in the Community. -
      I am not such a novice as to be ignorant of the obstacles which impede the success of a
      stranger destitute of friends, interest, and acquaintance; and that employments are procured
      more easily by those who are more fortunate, but Gentlemen: let me beg you will oppose to
      those difficulties, the truely Pitiable situation to which I am reduc'd; and let this
      consideration excite you; generously to Imagine what it is impossible to discribe; the
      exquisite feelings of a Person of sensibility; accoustomed to the Joys of society &amp; the
      Conveniences of life; by fatal Mischances; at once secluded from both, Oblig'd to exist the
      Child of dayly dependence, and compel'd by_ the indispensable call of nature to accept the
      unpleasant Condition. (vile debasing necessity), the universal benevolence of which your
      Characters bespeak you Possess'd; Join'd with these reflections; I flatter myself will supply
      the place of acquaintance, interest &amp; friends. - </P>
   <P>Permit me Gentlemen; to inform you farther; that in the last War I spent several years in the
      service of my Country (chiefly in Character;) and during my residence in the Indies served in
      a similar Capacity, for the verity of this I have sufficient vouchers; &amp; should think
      myself happy in an opportunity of submitting them to the inspection of your Patriotick and
      honourable Board. </P>
   <P>Now Gentlemen: If on perusing this paper you shou'd think proper in any manner to honour me

   <Title>MINUTES OF THE EXECUTIVE CouNCIL OF NovA ScoTIA 1</Title>
   <P>At a Council holden at Halifax on the 28th of September 1775</P>
   <P>Read the Extract of a Letter from General Gage to the Governor dated the 5th of Septemr: as
      follows Vizt</P>
   <P>The Admiral has not so many Vessells in the Bay of Fundy that the Rebells from this Province
      will not have an opportunity to land there, but to Guard against the worst some temporary Work
      may be thrown up &amp; additions may be made to the Old Works on the Citadel Hill as you shall
      judge best &amp; in some manner to fortify &amp; entrench about the Navy Yard. I think this
      will be better than Captain [William] Spry's proposal of Blockhouses which may. be easily
      fired &amp; wou'd not be finish'd this Season -</P>
   <P>And the Engineer Capn. Spry attending and being _call'd in &amp; having answer'd several
      Questions proposed - It was Consider'd, That the Nature of the Ground being Rocky in most
      places wou'd not admit of an intrenchment, also that the frost &amp; rains attending the
      Season coming on wou'd interrupt &amp; prevent such Work from being compleated that therefore
      the only practicable fortification woud be by Temporary Blockhouses &amp; Pallisadoes. And it
      was Resolved that the Engineer do immediately proceed to fortify the Navy Yard in that manner;
      which may be defended by the People of the Town &amp; afford a retreat for them. </P>
   <P>And in respect of fortifying the Citadel Hill it was consider'd that the Season is now too far
      advanced to undertake anything, especially considering the great want'cif Workmen &amp; troops
      for the defence of it -</P>
   <P>And on further consideration of the most secure &amp; effectual measure for the defence of the
      Town: </P>
   <P>The Governor proposed for the consideration of the Council the means &quot;of Collecting a
      force to the Number of One thousand Men to be provided with Pay &amp; Provisions: which was
      unanimously Agreed to &amp; approv'd of &amp; further Resolv'd that the four Companies of
      Light Infantry now forming at Lunenburg be Order'd immediately for this Town, &amp; that Mr.
      E[nsign] be order'd to send these Troops to Halifax in the most Expeditious manner. Also that
      one hundred Men from the Township of Clare &amp; Yarmouth &amp; the two light Infantry
      Companies from King's County do March immediately to Halifax. </P>

      inforce that Success they so earnestly wish, and I hope soon to congratulate them on it.
      Whilst t deprecate the untimely Misfortune, which p'revents me from sharing in the immediate
      Glory, it was perhaps inflicted in such a critical Hour to serve the Common Cause, for if I
      had not arrived here, even on the very Day I did, as sure as God lives, the Army would have
      starved. The Letters I have been obliged to write to several officers, I have been under the
      Necessity of couching in Terms that I should have been ashamed of, did not Necessity apologize
      for me. In twenty two Days 538 Barr: of Provisions only had been sent across <name>Lake George</name>, and
      two Hundred and sixty Men, which take as many Batteaus as would have carryed two Hundred
      Barrels more, and not an . Ounce had been sent from this Place, Except twenty Days Allowance
      for about 230 Men who had left this after me and before my Return here. In six Days since my
      Arrival, five Hundred and forty two Barrels have been brought over <name>Lake George</name>, and two

   <P>Mr. Berrien applied to the Committee with sundry letters from the commissioners at the
      Highlands, by which it appears they want labourers. Ordered, That Mr. <name>John Berrien</name> be
      authorized to procure fifty able-bodied men, good labourers, at wages not exceeding 50s per
      month each, besides their provisions, to proceed immediately to assist in erecting the
      fortifications on the banks of Hudson's river, in the Highlands; that he procure as many of
      them who have and will take arms with them as he conveniently can; that he order and direct at
      least twelve carriage guns to be mounted there immediately, and provided with shot, carriages,
      rammers, sponges and every other necessary for the use of the said guns. And</P>
   <P>Ordered, That Mr. <name>Gabriel W. Ludlow</name>, deliver to Mr. <name>John Berrien</name> two hundred weight of

   <P>A letter from <name>Samuel Bayard</name> and others, dated 25th September, was read and filed, and is in
      the words following, to wit: </P>
   <P>At Constitution Fort, Monday 25th Sept. 1775</P>
   <P>Gentlemen - We received last night a letter from Mr. [John] Berrien, informing us that the
      plan for building the fortification, with the estimation of the expenses, was transmitted to
      the Continental Congress. We should have esteemed ourselves happy had we been consulted on
      this subject before it had been sent forward. It was easy for one of our body to have waited
      upon the Committe of Safety, to have given them full satisfaction relative to the situation of
      the ground, which it is not possible for them to know by the plan. We conceive that an
      operation of this kind is intended for the. defence of the Colony and for the advantage of
      America in general. If we are right in our conjecture, Mr. [Bernard] Romans' plan is not
      sufficient-it will only be a temporary expedient to prevent vessels going up the river, and
      should the fortification fall into the hands of the ministerial troops it will prove the ruin
      of the Province. Therefore it was not possible for him to give you any calculation relative to
      the whole expense, as it will be absolutely necessary to extend the works; and the place, we
      are convinced, may be made impregnable, and the expense not enormous. It appears to us that it
      would have been much better to have calculated the amount of what it would cost, than to be
      obliged hereafter to apply a second time to the Continental Congress. However, we submit our
      ideas to your judgment. It is our duty to be faithful to the important charge committed to our
      care, as we will not be answerable for measures we cannot conduct; therefore request the
      favour - of you, gentlemen, to inform us whether we are under Mr. Roman's direction, or
      whether he is obliged to consult with us upon the measures to be pursued. You cannot blame us
      for this request, as the safety, honour and interest of our country, and its future welfare,
      depend upon this important post. We think it our duty to give you a hint which seems to merit
      your consideration, viz: Gov. Tryon, Mr. <name>William Bayard</name> and Major Bayard, 2 have been up in
      our neighbourhood; his Excellency did not say any thing, but both the Bayards examined Capt.
      Palmer, our captain, with great scrutiny, in the presence of his Excellency, about the
      fortification, the nature of the ground, the state it was in, how many guns were mounted and
      how many men watched. This happened on Saturday, at Haverstraw. We shall keep a look out, for
      we expect them near to us. Will it not be prudent that we should have a guard. The minute men
      at New-Windsor want powder; they are ready to come to our assistance if they had it. - We
      ought to have powder and shot for our guns as we shall mount six this week, ninepounders. We
      are, with respect, gentlemen, [&amp;c.] </P>

      answering the orders I draw from time to time in favour of the workmen and furnishers of
      materials, and that £150 or £200 be advanced to be applied to such incidental matters as are

      Priddis, a merchant of that island, sent last July a sloop with provisions for the ministerial
      troops at Boston; and, in the captain's hearing, declared, that he would supply them with
      every thing that lay in his power: But, as for the Americans, they might starve and be d--d.
      This said rascal Priddis (who by the bye, it seems has some negro blood in him) is possessed
      of a very large estate, which he has got solely by the American trade, and not many years ago,
      when at the northward, received the kindest usage, from many gentlemen of distinction. </P>
   <P>Last week the Richmond packet was seized in Norfolk harbour, just after the passengers got on
      shore, by some banditti from the Kingfisher sioop, capt. [James] Montague. After rifling the
      passengers trunks, they went off, taking with them a middling of bacon, one pig, two hunting
      shirts, a tomahawk, two fowling pieces, and a silver hilted sword. </P>
   <P>A few days before, mr. <name>Joseph Middleton</name>, of Annapolis, in Maryland, with his wife and family,
      being on a visit to some relations in Norfolk, they were brought to by capt. Montague, who,
      after much insulting language, ordered them ashore in his boat, and made prize of their
      vessel, worth 150L a valuable negro man in her belonging to <name>mr. Middleton</name>'s brother, four
      mattrasses, one bed and furniture, a blue shirt, a case of cherry rum, seven swivel guns and
      one musket. Some time after, <name>mr. Middleton</name> went on board the man of war, to demand his vessel,
      &amp;c. when the valiant captain, with the usual insolence of the small gentry in the navy,
      damn'd him for a rebel, and said, had it not been for his wife and children, he would have
      sent him to Boston in irons, pointing to some that were lying upon deck. </P>

   <P>2. According to <name>Mary Barney</name>, who heard the story from the lips of her father-in-law, Joshua
      Barney (Barney, ed., Life of <name>Joshua Barney</name>, p. 26), Barney was stopped just within the
      Virginia capes by <name>H.M.S. Kingsfisher</name>. His interception was likely by the tender which had gone
      a cruizing as above. <name>Mary Barney</name>'s account reads: &quot;He entered the Chesapeake Bay on the
      1st of October, and was soon afterwards boarded by an officer from the British Sloop of war
      'Kingsfisher,' who, after searching his ship and taking possession of all the letters and the
      few arms that were found on board, gave him the exciting information that his countrymen were
      in a state of rebellion, and that two battles had already been fought, at Lexington, and
      Bunker's Hill: Barney literally 'devoured' the intelligence 'with greedy ear,' and was
      scarcely restrain_ed by the presence of His Majesty's loyal officers, and the gaping mouths of
      the 'Kingfisher,' from making such an exhibition of his own 'rebellious' spirit, as would in
      all probability have subjected him to detention, at least, if not to severe punishment; but
      fortunately for him, his discretion prevailed, and he was permitted to proceed. He had been
      too fotle at home from the period of his twelfth. year, to hear much of the rumbling which so
      long preceded the great political storm now at hand; and if the. idea of a revolution had ever
      entered his mind, it was as of some far distant future event, the glories of which might have
      been faintly shadowed to his youthful fancy, but never with such distinctness, even in his
      wildest dream of ambition, as to leave the impression of his own participation. But here it
      was, - just beginning to develope its teeming dangers and honors, at the very moment that he
      himself was bursting into the first vigor of. youth, and panting for opportunities ,of
      distinction. Could it be true? .And would he indeed have a chance of drawing a sword in the
      service of his country? - If he could have added wings to his ship; or fleetness to the breeze
      that was wafting her gently along the smooth surface of the Chesapeake, the days that
      intervened before he stood upon the shore of his native city would have been converted into
      minutes - so eager was he to hear a confirmation of the news.&quot; </P>

   <P>May it please your Excellency, </P>
   <P>It is with great concern we find that for some days past, your Excellency has been pleased to
      withdraw yourself from Charlestown, the seat of your Government, and have retired on board the
      King's ship. The inconveniences which must unavoidably arise to the people, deprived by this
      step, of that access to your Excellency, which is absolutely necessary for transacting public
      affairs, is apparent; and we submit to your Excellency's consideration, whether the retirement
      of our Governor to a King's ship, in this time of general disquietude, when the minds of the
      people are filled with the greatest apprehensions for their safety, may not increase their
      alarm, and excite jealousies of some premeditated design against them. </P>
   <P>We, therefore, entreat, that your Excellency will return to Charlestown, the usual place of
      residence of the Governor of South-Carolina; and, your Excellency may be assured, that whilst,
      agreeable to your repeated and solemn declarations, your Excellency shall take no active part
      against the good people of this Colony, in the present arduous struggle for the preservation
      of their civil liberties, we will, to the utmost of our power, secure to your Excellency that
      safety and respect for your person and character, which the inhabitants of Carolina have ever

   <Title>&quot;EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM BERMUDA DATED SEPTR 29TH 1775.&quot; </Title>
   <P>The unhappy Disputes between Great Britain and America not only affect us with the utmost
      regret at the Calamities of our fellow Subjects, but are likely to involve us in Distresses
      scarcely inferior to their's. - Our Legislature, allarmed at the dreadful aspect of
      approaching Famine, passed a Law in May last, prohibiting the Exportation of any kind of
      Provisions untill all obstructions to supplies from America should be removed. An Application
      was made soon after to the Continental Congress representing our Situation, and requesting
      some Relaxation of their Commercial Restrictions in favor of a people incapable of injuring,
      or of serving them, and solely dependant on them for supplies for at least Nine Months in the
      Year. In Expectation of obtaining the Indulgence we sued for, the Legislature was induced in
      the Middle of August to suspend the operation of some part of the Law, untill the tenth of
      September, as there was a considerable Quantity of Rice in the Country the property of Non
      Inhabitants - Which being less saleable than other provisions was permitted to be exported.
      But no provisions, whatsoever, the property of persons residing in the Island were permitted
      to be exported.- </P>
   <P>On the third Instant the Inhabitants of St Georges were allarmed by a Report that a Vessel
      that had sailed that Day had been privately loaded with provisions in express Violation of the
      <name>Law of the Country</name>, and despatched by the Governor to Boston - The Committee of St Georges,
      appointed by the Law to search all suspected Vessels, immediately procured a Boat and with
      some others went out in pursuit of her - They got on board about eleven O: Clock at Night at
      the Distance of five or six Leagues from the Land - Upon searching there were no provisions
      found on board as had been represented to the Committee. There was reason however to suspect
      that the Vessel was dispatched with some sinister Intent from the secret Manner in which she
      had been sent off, because nothing of the kind could be proved. she was permitted to proceed
      on the Voyage without any Molestation whatsoever - The Captains name is Lightbourne - The
      Sloop I believe belongs to one Sawyer of Newbury in New England-He told the Committee that he
      was bound to New York. - This Transaction has been construed as a most flagrant opposition to
      Government, and will, no Doubt, be represented in that Light, in England. - 2 </P>
   <P>There wanted nothing to confirm the apparent Justice of such a Representation but an Incident
      which happened last _Night and this Morning. The Scorpion Sloop of War commanded by the
      honourable Captain [John] Tollemache, with a Transport, arrived about a fortnight past, from
      Boston - We were at a loss to know the Reason of such an unexpected Visit; altho' we could not
      help forming some Conjectures concerning the Occasion of it. The last Evening Intelligence was
      received at Somerset Bridge, that a Shallop with a party of Men from on board the Scorpion,
      completely armed, and under the Command of an officer had left St Georges in the Afternoon -
      The place of her Destination was suspected to be Ely's Harbour - *As there was reason to
      apprehend that they come in quest of Provisions, a party of Gentlemen immediately assembled,
      and sent on board a Schooner, which had just arrived from Charlestown with a Load of Rice, to
      secure her Sails, Boom and Rudder, that she might not be carried off. Another party repaired
      to Bethell's Island where there was a considerable Quantity of Rice, Bread &amp; Flour in a
      Warehouse, in order to secure that too. Soon after the Shall op arrived, and the Officer
      waited on the Captain of the Schooner to purchase the Cargoe, which was refused - Upon his
      Return several Gentlemen were deputed from the Number of those assembled on the Island, which
      were by that Time near 100 well armed, to demand the Reason of such an hostile Appearance in a
      place where the utmost Tranquility had reigned before. The officer very politely told them he
      came up to purchase a Cargoe of Provisions on the Account of Government - The Gentlemen
      replied that if it was intended for Exportation there was an express <name>Law of the Country</name>
      against it. The Officer assured them that he knew not of such a Law, and that he acted only in
      obedience to express Command. As there was no reason to apprehend that under the present
      Circumstances, any person would supply them, the Company for the most part dispersed - Some
      few remained to observe that no Violence was offered to the Provisions on board the Schooner,
      or on the Island. In the morning the Officer with his attendants went on board the Schooner,
      demanded the Sails &amp;c, and Told the Captain that he had express orders to sieze the
      Schooner &amp; Provisions for the Service of Government, if he would not sell them to him.
      This he was preparing to execute when a party of Gentlemen went on board and obstinately
      refused to permit the vessel to be removed from her Moorings, or any of the Rice to be taken
      off, against the Consent of the Master.* The Officer then went off with his Attendants to St
      Georges, telling the Gentlemen he would bring the whole Force of the Scorpion to carry the
      Point. He was assured that an equal Force could be raised at a Moment's Warning to repel any
      lawless Invasion of the property of an Individual, or to prevent an arbitrary Violation of an
      express Act of the Legislature of the Island. If they have not more wit in their anger than to
      attempt to execute their Design by Force, we may expect the Honor of another Visit this
      Evening or to morrow - but we shall brave the Stings of the Scorpion whilst we act in Defence
      of the Liberties of Mankind, and the Laws of our Country - The Rice is all on shore except
      fifty Barrels, which will be landed, before they can possibly return, and conveyed to some
      place of Security, unles our hourses are no more sacred than our Vessels from the Hands of
      arbitrary Rapine. Thus, you see we are not exempted from attempts at Despotic Oppression,
      since every petty Tyrant in Commission dares to usurp the power of infringing the most sacred
      Laws! - 3 </P>

   <P>The Manoeuvers of the Camp has afforded nothing important for a month past. The Works at
      plough'd Hill are finish'd, but are useless, because we have not Powder to annoy the Enemy
      &amp; if we had, it would be an idle Expence of it to expend it in Cannonading at such a
      Distance. The Enemy have fir'd from their different Works 2000 Cannon Balls &amp; 300 Bombs,
      without killing ten men of ours.</P>
   <P>When Orders were given for 1100 men under Col. [Benedict] Arnold to march for Quebec, the men
      offer'd so readily, that 5 Times the Number might have been draughted for this laborious &amp;
      hazardous March, had they been wanted. We were in anxious Suspense, during their Passage from
      Newbury to Kennebeck; We have Accounts since of their safe Arrival in Kennebeck River, &amp;
      are now only solicitous to hear of the successful Movements of General [Philip] Sc[h]uyler. </P>
   <P>The Lovers of Turtle in the Camp are like to be indulg'd with a feast of it, by the Marblehead
      men this Week taking a Schooner belonging to <name>Lewis Gray</name> bound from New Providence to Boston,
      loaded with Turtle &amp; Fruit. This is no very great Acquisition for Us, but will be a severe
      Disappointment to our ministerial beseig'd Enemy. The next Day some Boats from <name>Cape Ann</name> took a
      more valuable Prize, in the Capture of a Brig sent by Genl [Guy] Carleton to Boston from
      Quebec, with 45 horned Cattle &amp; 60 Sheep on board, &amp; the Hold full of Wheat. This is
      lmt a small Retaliation for the dayly Piratical Acts of [Samuel] Graves's Squadron. There is
      scarce a Vessel that escapes the Clutches of the Cutters &amp; Men of War that infest the
      Coast. The Week before last they carried eleven sail of Vessels into Boston, where after the
      Formality of a Trial in an Admiralty Court, they are confiscated, to the Use of Graves &amp;
      his Harpies. - Notwithstanding these continual Depredations, our Assembly will not be
      prevail'd to fit out Privateers. The Delicacy is absurd surely . . . </P>
   <P>The Carphenters are all at Work here, building 20 flat bottom Boats, which are to carry 50
      men, &amp; which with 250 Whale Boats, which it is said are ordered here, can carry 3000 Men.
      There are 3 floating Batteries which carry 1 nine pounder &amp; 2 six Pounders each, besides,
      Swivells &amp; small Arms. They are man'd with 30 Hands apiece; From these &amp; some other
      Preparations it is conjecturd, some great Attempt will be made before the Winter sets in. . .

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>His Majesty having, thought proper to Order me to repair to England immediately, and to
      Appoint General Howe to Command during my Absence in obedience to these Commands, I shall
      embark as soon as possible; but As I know the great use you have for His Majesty's Ships, I
      will not distress you by an Application for a Ship of War to carry me and have therefore
      Ordered .a transport to be got in readyness with all expedition, and shall be Obliged to you
      for a Convoy as far as may be Necessary,</P>

   <P>Boston 30 September 1775.</P>
   <P>Your Excellency may depend upon a Convoy over Saint Georges Bank, or further, if necessary,
      with every other Assist.ance the Squadron can give. - My Barge is always at your Excellency's
      Service, and I am really concerned it is not in my power to appoint a Man of War to carry You
      to England. I have the Honor to be with great regard and esteem. Sir, [&amp;c.]</P>

   <Title>NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES1</Title>
   <P>[Boston] 30 [September, 1775]</P>
   <P>General Gage notified to the Admiral his intention of going to England, and requested a Convoy
      to see him clear of the Land, which the Admiral immediately assured him, should be ready at
      his own time, offered his Excellency every accomodation for embarking, and expressed a concern
      that he could not appoint a Ship of the Squadron to carry him.</P>
   <P>The Mercury, coming into Boston, met with, took, and brought in a Vessel loaden with flour,
      bread, iron, harness and other things.</P>
   <P>The same day the Admiral wrote to Governor Legge and Captain Wallace upon the subject of
      provisions and fuel, matters of great consequence at this time that created many difficulties. </P>

   <Title>VICE ADMIRAL <name>SAMUEL GRAVES</name> TO <name>FRANCIS LEGGE</name> 1</Title>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 30th Sepr 1775</P>
   <P>I have the Honor of your Excellency's Letters August 27th and 28th and of the 4th &amp; 11th
      instant with their lnclosures. I am particularly obliged to your Excellency for pointing out
      so clearly the Scarcity likely to happen in the Province of <name>Nova Scotia</name> by our drawing from
      thence too large Supplies of Cattle and other Stock. Many of the Inhabitants of Boston have
      fitted out Vessels and entreated permission to go to <name>Nova Scotia</name> to procure fresh Provisions;
      hitherto they have not been refused, and it would have the Appearance of Cruelty to deny them,
      but as they have all been wanting in that respect due to your Excellency, and, under pretence
      of furnishing the Navy, have perhaps obtained Indulgences they were otherwise not intitled to,
      I beg leave to assure you that altho' the Tenor of Passes hath been generally to procure fresh
      Stock for the Army and Navy, they have been granted under a Supposition that <name>Nova Scotia</name> was
      benefited by the Trade, and with a View to supply our Market, and not for the particular Use
      of the Fleet. Whatever we may wish to have in future for the Fleet I will make particular
      Applications for to your Excellency, and I suppose the General will do the same for the Army;
      And with respect to all those who now have my pass, your Excellency will be the best Judge how
      far they can be indulged, but no part is for the Fleet.</P>
   <P>Your Excellency may depend that a proper force shall be stationed in the Bay of Fundy to
      protect the Coast and Inhabitants from any Insults or Depredations of the Rebels. I am
      &amp;c</P>

   <Title>VICE ADMIRAL <name>SAMUEL GRAVES</name> TO CAPTAIN <name>EDWARD LE CRAS</name>, H.M.S. Somerset, HALIFAX1 </Title>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 30 Sepr 1775</P>
   <P>I have received by the Pacquet your Letters of the 13th and 15th instant together with the
      lnclosures therein mentioned. And by the Store Ship which arrived the 29th your Letters of the
      17th 18th and 21st instant and Duplicates of your Dispatches by the Pacquet. My time is so
      much taken up at present that I cannot reply so fully as I wish to do, and shall therefore
      only speak to those points that require dispatch, until another opportunity. In all cases of
      Seizures where the Cargo or Hull cannot be libelled with a tolerable Prospect of being
      condemned, it is best to allow the Vessel to be unladen and the Cargo sold for the Owners,
      reserving a preference of the whole or any part for the Kings Service. In some Cases I have
      taken Bond, but principally where known disaffected people have been proprietors; so that your
      ha~ing a Bond for the Salt is as much as at present can be done. With respect to the Vessel, I
      think it best to let her remain where she is, unless the property iri her is changed to more
      friendly people, or that you find she cannot legally be prevented from navigating. And now I
      am on the subject of Captures, I must acquaint you that although Government is sending out
      great reinforcements to the Fleet, I have not yet received more enlarged operating powers than
      I was before possessed of, so that the Acts of Parliament must be your general Guide where a
      special Order from me does not direct otherwise, and also except in urgent and very flagrant
      Cases. </P>
   <P>I approve of your precautions and of the Orders given for the Security of the Yard, and desire
      you will cause them to be punctually observed without respect of persons. This is a time when
      the utmost precision is necessary and the most exact Discipline should be enforced. </P>
   <P>Too much praise cannot be given to your diligence in equipping the Somerset, and the attention
      you have at the same time bestowed on the Kings Yard, which from your Report is indeed in bad
      condition, and it can never be otherwise when its Government is lodged in three persons
      generally unequal to the Task separately or collectively, and always invested with very
      abridged powers. I shall therefore depend on your putting every thing in the best Order
      possible before Winter and in seein.e: as much justice done to the King as you can. </P>
   <P>It is surely defeating the intention of the Legislature of Great Britain to suffer Emigrants
      from New England since the Rebellion to enjoy the Priviledges of the other inhabitants of Nova
      Scotia, and their Assembly might I think have obliged all such to be residents a year or two,
      and to have given some proof of their Loyalty, before they should be capable of carrying on
      any Commerce by Sea. And it is also to be wished Registers were not so indiscriminately
      granted, but it is difficult to say how or where the line could be drawn. </P>
   <P>As you wish for another Ship, and perhaps <name>Mr O'Brien</name> may go that way, I have sent you the
      Fowey to be hove down, repaired, new sheathed and fitted again with all possible Dispatch. </P>
   <P>I am glad the Savage is sailed for Newfoundland. </P>
   <P>The arrival of the Mercury obliges me to detain the Fowey a few days longer, so that [you
      will] receive this by the Pacquet; and I will if possible write to you again by Captain
      Montagu. I am &amp;c. </P>

   <Title>MINUTES OF THE NEW YORK COMMITTEE OF SAFETY1</Title>
   <P>[New York] Die Sabati, 9 Ho. A.M. September 30th 1775.</P>
   <P>Mr. <name>Bernard Romans</name> attending at the door, was called in. The Committee conversed with him on
      the subject of his being an engineer at the fortifications on the banks of Hudson's river in
      the Highlands, and Mr. Romans withdrew. After some time spent therein, Mr. Romans was called
      in, and the Chairman by order of the Committee, informed Mr. Romans that the Committee would
      not contract with him for building the said fortifications; that he should be paid for his
      services as an engineer; that as the Continental Congress was sitting and the Provincial
      Congress to meet in a few days, the Committee could not make any proposal of, or any answer
      to, establishing him as an engineer, during the unhappy controversy in America; but that if
      his merits in the pressent business should appear to be such as to recommend him, it would be
      an advantage to his reputation; and that should the controversy unfortunately continue long,
      it was probable his future services might be wanted; that the Committee had been informed that
      twelve shillings a day sterling (and not twenty shillings sterling as he alleged,) was the
      value of the pay and perquisites of an engineer on the British establishment; but that the
      infancy and present circumstances of the country will not admit of allowing pay equal to that
      given in old settled States; that the Committee could not encourage him to expect more than
      the pay of a colonel in the Continental army, and that only for the present; but that this
      proposal shall not stand in the way of any better provision for him, if the Continental
      Congress should think proper to make any better; and that as he stood in need of cash, he
      should have an order on the Treasurer of the Congress of this Colony for some money.
      Thereupon, </P>
   <P>Ordered, That <name>Peter V. B. Livingston</name>, Esq., Treasurer of the Provincial Congress of this
      Colony, advance to <name>Bernard Romans</name> as engineer at the fortifications in the Highlands, the sum
      of twenty pounds on account. </P>
   <P>A draft of a letter to the agents for erecting the fortifications in the Highlands was read
      and approved of, and is in the words following, to wit:</P>
   <P>In Committee of Safety, for the Colony of New-York, In the recess of the Congress of the
      Colony, New-York, </P>
   <P>Sept. 30th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Gentlemen - We were favoured with yours of the 25th inst. In answer thereto we beg leave to
      observe that Mr. Romans was brought to assist in planning and directing the fortifications by
      your advice and request. The estimate and plans he delivered to us, we sent to the Continental
      Congress with a letter mentioning that at least fifteen hundred pounds beyond the estimate
      might be necessary for incidental charges exclusive of cannon. Mr. Romans is now to proceed to
      you and give you his best advice and assistance as an engineer. </P>
   <P>The Congress of this Colony will meet next week. We also soon expect directions from the
      Continental Congress, and in the meantime we hope the works may be carried on with all your
      joint wisdom, advice and assistance. </P>

      Inhabitant of this Town as also the Persons of two of his Family. </P>
   <P>We beg leave to represent to your Lordship, that this Act is both illegal and riotous, and
      that together with a Musquet-ball fired into the Town yesterday from on board the King Fisher
      has greatly alarmed and incensed the Inhabitants, and has occasioned a great number of the
      Women and Children to abandon this Borough, and that if these arbitrary Proceedings pass
      unnoticed by your Lordship as Chief Magistrate of this Colony that none of the Inhabitants are
      Safe from insult and abuse. we therefore as our duty represent this Matter to your Lordship
      for you interposition. </P>
   <P>We my Lord as Men, and as a Common Hall-have ever preserved the peace of this Town, and have
      never prevented the Ships of War and others from being supply'd with Provisions or any other
      Necessaries, and have Carefully avoided offering any insult to any of His Majesty's Servants.
      We had therefore hoped that the Inhabitants would never have been molested in their lawful
      business. We are Sorry however to have it in our power to State this fact to your Lordship
      which we must and do think a gross violation of all that Men and Freemen can hold dear. </P>
   <P>Allow us to observe to your Lordship, that if the - Inhabitants had been disposed to repel
      insult, that they were Sufficiently able either to have cut off or taken Prisoners the Small
      Party that came on Shore, and this we hope is another Proof of their peaceable intentions. </P>
   <P>We the Mayor, Alderman and Common Council of the Borough of Norfolk, do most earnestly entreat
      your Lordship, that the Captains of the Men of War may not reduce the Inhabitants to the
      dreadful alternative of defending their Persons, or tamely suffering themselves to be abused;
      and to request that your Lordship will interpose your Authority to put a final Stop to such
      violent infringements of our rights; and to order the Persons Seized on by Captain Squire to
      be immediately put on Shore, and the property to be replaced from whence it was taken. </P>

   <P>(Copy)</P>
   <P>To the Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council of the Borough of Norfolk in Common Hall assembled -
      [September 30] </P>
   <P>Gentlemen I was an Eye Witness to a Party belonging to the Otter Sloop of War landing at the
      time and place you mention, and did see them bring off two of the Printers Servants, together
      with his Printing Utensils, and I do realy think they could not have rendered the Borough of
      Norfolk or the Country adjacent to it, a more essential Service than [to] deprive them of the
      means of poisining the minds of the People, and exciting in them a Spirit of Rebellion and
      Sedition, and by that means drawing inevitable ruin and destruction on themselves and Country. </P>
   <P>As to the illegalety of the Act, some of you in this very Common Hall Assembled ought to blush
      when you make use of the expression, as you cannot but be Conscious that you have by every
      means in your power, totally subverted the Laws and Constitution, and have been the Aiders and
      Abettors in throwing off all Allegiance to that Majesty's Crown and Government to whom you
      profess yourselves faithfull Subjects. As to the <name>Musquet Ball</name> being fired into the Town, I
      believe there is not a Man in it that is not Satisfied it was an accident, and such a one as I
      hope will not happen again. </P>
   <P>With regard to your having ever preserved the peace in your Town, there is very recent proof
      of the Contrary 2 </P>
   <P>Your not repelling the insult (as you call it) or taking prissoners the small party that was
      on Shore, I impute to some other reason (from your Drums beating to Arms, during the greatest
      part of the time which the party was on Shore) than to your peaceable intentions. </P>
   <P>As to your last requisition, I do assure you that every means in my power shall be employed,
      both with the Navy and Army, to preserve the peace good order and happiness of the Inhabitants
      of the Borough of Norfolk, so long as they behave themselves as Faithfull Subjects to His
      Majesty; and I expect at the same time, that, if an individual shall behave himself as your
      Printer has done by aspersing the Characters of His Majesty's Servants and others, in the most
      false and Scandalous manner, and being the instigator of Treason and Rebellion, and you do not
      take proper Steps to restrain such off enders, that you will not be surprised if the Military
      power interposes to prevent the tottall dissolution of all decencey, Order and good
      Government; But I promise you on my Honor, that, if the Printer will put himself and Servants
      under my protection, that they shall not meet with the least insult, and shall be permitted to
      print every occurrance that happens during these unhappy disputes between the Mother Country
      and her Colonies, he confining himself to truth, and representing matters in a fair Candid
      impartial manner on both sides; this I hope will convince you that I had nothing more in view,
      when I requested Captain [Matthew] Squire to Seize the Tipes, than, that the unhappy deluded
      Publick might no longer remain in the Dark concerning the present contest, but that they
      should be furnished with a fair representation of facts, which I know never would happen, if
      the Press was to remain under the Controul of its present Dictators. </P>

   <P>I have received a message, signed by you, from a set of people who style. themselves a General
      Committee. The presumption of such an address, from a body assembled by no legal authority,.
      and whom I must consider as in actual and open rebellion against their Sovereign, can only be
      equalled by the outrages, which obliged me to take refuge on board the King's ships in the
      harbour. </P>
   <P>It deserves no answer, nor should I have given it any, but to mark the hardiness with which
      you have advanced, that I could so far forget my duty to my Sovereign and my country, as to
      promise I would take no active part in bringing the subverters of our glorious constitution,
      and the real liberties of the people, to a sense of their duty. The unmanly acts that have
      already been used to prejudice me in the general opinion, may still be employed by that
      Committee; but I never will return to Charlestown, till I can support the King's authority,
      and protect his faithful and loyal subjects. </P>
   <P>Whenever the people of this province will put it in my power to render them essential service,
      I will, with pleasure, embrace the opportunity; and think it, a very happy one. I am, Sir,

   <P>This Afternoon one of your Officers brought up a paper from on board the Tamar, addressed to
      <name>Henry Laurens</name>,. Esq; - It appeared to have been intended as an Answer to a Message from the
      General Committee to his Excellency the Governor - it had no Signature* but the Officer
      declared he brought it from Lord <name>William Campbell</name>.</P>
   <P>We find that, upon your Officer's return to his Boat, he was much insulted by some Persons, at
      present unknown. We hereby express our concern at such a Proceeding, which we absolutely
      disavow; And we assure you, that all possible Inquiry shall be made into this unwarrantable
      behaviour, in order that Satisfaction may be obtained for the insult.</P>

   <P>In answer to your Letter of Yesterday's Date the General Committee think proper to inform you,
      that they have not refused a Supply of Provisions to the King's Ships in this Harbour, nor
      have they taken one Step to prevent their Watering. The hostile Dispositions which the
      Commander of those Ships has for some Time past shewn towards this Colony, by imprisoning its
      Pilots, affording [Sanctuary] to a Traitor, Seizing its Seamen, dismantling its principal
      Fortification, stopping private Property, and firing upon the Persons of its Inhabitants who
      were not only peacable but unarmed, and driven from the Shore, do make it necessary, in their
      Opinion, to alter the Mode of Supply. And as you have declared, that you do not mean to leave
      .the Station, it can be no Disadvantage to His Majesty's Ships to receive their Provisions
      from Day to Day in this warm Climate.</P>
   <P>You are pleased to assert, that we have taken the absolute Government of this Province into
      our Hands. Let it Suffice as an Answer to you, Sir, that we deny the Charge - But you may
      depend we shall notwithstanding any Threats take every necessary Step in our Pow.er for
      securing our Property and preserving Peace and good Order in this His Majesty's
      Government.</P>

      her journal indicates some firing upon boats. The minutes of .the Charles-Town General

   <P>LETTER FROM THE CAMP AT CAMBRIDGE1</P>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Oct. 1, 1775</P>
   <P>In the course of this week, two vessels laden with provisions, &amp;c. have been taken from
      the enemy. One of them is a brig from Quebec laden with cattle 2 &amp;c. a donation from the
      tories in Quebec to the ministerial troops at Boston, but will now be more properly applied.
      This last was taken by some men from <name>Cape Ann</name>, with musquets in open boats - There are several
      intercepted letters, one of them contains the following paragraph, which must give great
      pleasure to every friend of his country, as it confirms the accounts we have had of the temper
      of the Canadians. The letter is from [<name>Thomas G</name>]amble, Deputy Quarter Master General to Maj.
      [William] Sher[r]iff, dated Quebec, Sept. 6, &quot;the rebels have taken post at Port Au Fare,
      and an invasion of the province is expected; should that take place, I am apt to think the
      Canadians will lay down their arms and not fire a shot. Their minds are all poisoned by
      emissaries from New England, and the damn'd rascals of merchants here, and at Montreal;
      General Carleton is (I believe) afraid to order out the militia, least they should refuse to
      obey. In short, the Quebec bill is of no use, on the contrary, the Canadians talk of that
      d--d, abused, Word Liberty.&quot; There are other letters of the same import.</P>
   <P>The General has directed three vessels to be armed and manned, to intercept the transports
      daily arriving at Boston with provisions, &amp;c. The people of this province, particularly on
      the coast, are much pleased with it, and we expect to derive no small advantage from it. </P>

   <P>A strong S.W. wind put into Marblehead last week a New Providence man,2 with a large number of
      turtle, etc. etc. They boarded, took and carryed him to Salem, and prevented the scoundrels
      from en joying and feasting on callipee, callipack, and a desert of pine apples, etc. A few
      fisher men also have taken a brigantine 3 from Quebec with cattle, sheep, oatmeal, etc., a
      present from the Tory merchants, etc. to the sick and wounded in Boston, and some forage for
      the Light horse. She is carried in to <name>Cape Ann</name>. There are two letters from one Gamble, an
      officer, one to General [Thomas] Gage, the other to Sherriff, which tell them that they are to
      expect no aid to Government from there; that [Guy] Carleton dare not issue his orders to the
      militia, supposing they could not be obeyed; that the Canadians, poisoned from New England,
      had got in use the damned abused word Liberty. I can't recollect the time she sailed, her
      bills [of] lading dated September 5, but the master says that Carlton has had no success in
      recrmtmg. He went off the night he came away, for <name>St. Johns</name>, with about seventy five
      ragamuffins, the whole posse he could collect; that there were at Quebec 10,000 barrels
      powder. I long for them more than turtle or pine apples. [Benedict] Arnold was last Monday
      [September 25] with his detachment, sixty miles up Kennebeck, every thing as it should be. We
      please ourselves with fine prospects of success. I say nothing about <name>St. Johns</name>, etc. presuming

      about ten days ago, at the Capes, Some few, but a very few, of the most violent here, made at

      to drive, or cart, out of the Town all the Tories, as they term those who will not muster, nor

   <P>A Informer is such a mean despcable Caracter that I shudder to think that I Should be branded
      by such a Name, yet when I reflect that what I am doing is self disinterested and I only mean
      it to advantage of my Country, it lays easy on my Mind I think its now high time that every
      friend to Britain was exerting their utmost abilities (according to their different Stations
      in Life) to annoy by every possible means these Damned Rebels to the british Governmt Animated
      by these Sentiments I cannot think of seeing a Vessel fitted out by Noted Rebels for the
      purpose of bringing in Powder for the Enemies of our King without acquainting you of it. </P>
   <P>The Vessel I mean is a small Schooner laying at Oranges wharf, she has a square Tuck painted
      Yallow a White bottom, black waisted with a Woman head, She was formerly the property of a Mr
      Hargraves. - She is fitting out by Hencocks Ambassador Capt. Dean and some other principal
      Rebels, I think they mean to Cruize with her off our Capes for a Vessel that is expected with
      Powder the property of a Rebel who had some Rum justly siezed the other Day, should you be so
      good as to sieze this <name>Vilian Dean</name> with his Vessel (for he is to go in her) it will give a
      great deal of satisfaction to your friends. The taking that Rascal Holts printing Materials
      from him yesterday give our party Infinite satisfaction we have not been so intoxicated with
      joy since Bunkers Hill affair -</P>
   <P>We could not refrain from exulting notwithstanding the Verrifieng appearance of the ill
      Regulated Rebels; I could Number Thirty of them under Arms as I pass'd them, when the Soldiers
      had done about half their business, but these were all officers, they could not get but eight
      Privates and these were Mustered after the Soldiers were gone. The unconcernedness with which
      the Soldiers did their business is much applauded - In the mean time wishing success to the
      British Army and Navy.</P>

   <Title>&quot;EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM NORFOLK, OCTOBER 1.&quot; </Title>
   <P>Yesterday came ashore about 15 of the King's soldiers, and marched up to the printing-office,
      out of which they took all the types and part of the press, and carried them on board the new
      ship Eilbeck, in presence, I suppose, of between two and three hundred spectators, without
      meeting with the least molestation; and upon the drums beating up and down the town, there
      were only about 35 men to arms. They say they want to print a few papers themselves; that they
      looked upon the press not to be free, and had a mind to publish something in vindication of
      their own characters. But as they have only part of the press, and no ink as yet, it is out of
      their power to do any thing in the printing business. They have got neither of the
      compositors, but I understand their is a printer on board the Otter. Mr. Cumming the
      book-binder, was pressed on board, but is admitted ashore at times: He says Capt. [Matthew]
      Squire was very angry they did not get Mr. [<name>John Hunter</name>] Holt who happened to be in the house
      the whole time they were searching, but luckily made his escape, notwithstanding the office
      was guarded all round. Mr. Cumming also informs, that the Captain says he will return every
      thing in safe order to the office, after he answers his ends, which, he says, will be in about
      three weeks - It was extremely melancholy to hear the cries of the women and children in the
      streets; most of the families are moving out of town, with the greatest expedition; the carts
      have been going all this day. </P>

   <P>The People at Marblehead have taken a Vessel from New Providence with Turtle and other
      delicacies the produce of that Island and designed for the delicate palates of the Rebels in
      Boston, but by a S.: West Wind forced into Marblehead. The People of <name>Cape Ann</name> have taken a
      Brigantine from Quebec for Boston with Cattle, Sheep, Oatmeal, and some Forage for the Rebel
      army and Carried her into that place. The armed Vessel at Machias have destroyed the remains
      of the fort at <name>St. John</name>'s River, brought off some Cannon and taken a Brigantine from Nova
      Scotia for Boston with Stock, &amp;c. Coll. Arnold was eight days ago sixty miles up Kennebeck
      with his detachment for Quebec, all in high Spirits and well provided, so that we have the
      most pleasing prospects of Success in Canada. Two letters were found on Board the Brigantine
      from Quebec wrote by one Gamble, who chartered her. he is an Officer in the Army and
      Intimately acquainted with Gage. one Letter is to Gage, the other to Maj. [William] Sherriff,
      telling them that no Aid is to be Expected to Government from that Quarter, that Carleton dare
      not Issue his Orders to the Militia, supposeing they would not be obeyed, and that the
      Canadians, poisoned from <name>N. England</name>, had got the use of that damned Abused word Liberty. </P>

   <P>Last Monday [September 25] arrived here, from Boston, in 5 days, the ship Nautilus, and
      brought in a brig, Capt. Sage, from Jamaica, and a New-York pilot-boat.</P>
   <P>Last Saturday [September 30] arrived here, from Boston, the Viper ship of 12 guns, and a brig
      of 6 guns, with two large transports, supposed to be in quest of live stock; it is said these
      vessels attempted to take stock off the Vineyard, but were disappointed by the assembling of a
      number of armed men.</P>
   <P>On Friday the Nautilus, with 2 tenders, sailed, to convoy 4 brigs to Boston; the next day one
      of the brigs, Capt. Benj. Bowers, being near the shore of Dartmouth, was boarded by a number
      of Provincials and carried into Bedford. After she was boarded, one of the ship's tenders came
      up, fired two broadsides, and grappled her; the people on board lying close till the tender
      was fast, when they rose and fired a number of small arms into her, which 'twas thought killed
      and wounded a number of the people; upon which the tender cut her fasts, and made off.</P>
   <P>Last Tuesday night a party of the American army, under Col. [Benjamin] Tupper, went on
      Governor's Island, near the castle, in Massachusetts Bay, and brought off 13 fat cattle, and 2
      of the light horse, and returned to Cambridge the next morning with their booty, without
      suffering the least damage. They also burnt all the buildings thereon, with a considerable
      quantity of hay. </P>

   <Title>MINUTES OF THE AccoMAC CouNTY, VIRGINIA, CoMMITTEE OF OBSERVATION 1</Title>
   <P>At a meeting of the Committee of Accomack County, at the Court-House, October 2, 1775: It
      having been represented to this Committee, at a former meeting, that <name>Arthur Upshaw</name>, of this
      County, Gentleman, and a Member of this Committee, had sent out a vessel, loaded with grain,
      for the West Indies, since the 10th of last month, contrary to the Resolves of the Continental
      Association; this day the said Upshaw sent a letter by his son, acknowledging the notice, and
      confessing that his said vessel had sailed since the 10th of last month. And upon reading and
      considering the said letter, and hearing several witnesses upon oath, it appears that the said
      Upshaw has been some months past forwarding the said vessel for the sea; that he cleared her
      out the 20th of July last, for the British West-Indies, with grain, long before she was
      finished; that by sickness of his workmen afterwards, and other unexpected delays, he found he
      could not get her ready time enough, but that he was determined, at all events, she should
      sail; that after the 10th of last month, and before she did sail, sundry of the inhabitants of
      this County (one of them a Member of this Committee) waited on him, and cautioned him against
      sending out his vessel, as a step exceedingly disagreeable to the people; that he promised
      that company she should not sail till the Committee met, and he would wait on them. A day
      being accordingly appointed, sundry Members met, but not a sufficient number to form a
      Committee; that the said Upshaw having that day attended, according to promise, said he
      expected his vessel was then sailed, as he had given his master orders to sail the first fair
      wind. </P>
   <P>Resolved, unanimously, That the said Upshaw, by sending out the said vessel, has violated the
      Continental Association, and that his case be published in the <name>Virginia Gazette</name>, agreeable to
      the Resolve of the Eleventh Article of the said Association. </P>

   <P>Boston 3d October 1775</P>
   <P>I am to acknowledge your letter of the 5th Augst delivered to Me by Lieut. <name>Coll Collins</name>, sent
      by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, to take the command of the Marine Forces on shore
      here. I have to thank their Lordships for the late promotions made in that Corps, in
      consequence of the Vacancies that happened on the 17th June last; and in justice to the Marine
      Officers under my command (who have on all occasions distinguished themselves) I can't refuse
      transmitting the inclosed Memorial, which I beg you to lay before their Lordships, hoping the
      present Vacancies may be filled up, by the Officers now doing duty here.</P>
   <P>I must observe to You, that in the account transmitted home of the Action on the 17th June,
      Major Short is there mentioned in mistake; instead of Major [John] Tupper, who was thae day in
      the field, and commanded the Corps of Marines after the death of Major [John] Pitcairn, and

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 3 October 1775</P>
   <P>His Majesty's Ship Cerberus arrived the 26th of last month, and Captain [John] Symonds
      delivered to me the following Orders and Letters: Vizt Their Lordship's Order July 24, 1775,
      to stop all Ships bound to and from America, and search them for Letters, mentioning two Ships
      lately sailed from the Downs suspected to carry Letters from Persons in England, who secretly
      hold a traiterous Correspondence with the Rebels; Their Lordships Order August 2d to take the
      Cerberus under my command; Your Letter June 25 Duplicate, acknowledging the Receipt of my
      Letters by Mr Nicholls and Captain Chads; your Letter August 2d with an Extract of a Letter
      from his Majesty's Envoy at Lisbon and a Copy of a Letter from Mr Strickland at Gibraltar;
      your Letter August 3d answering in detail such of mine as required it, and inclosing a Scheme
      of the Naval force intended to be employed on the Coast of North America; And your three
      Letters August 5th that Lieut. Col. Collins is appointed to command the Marines at Boston; to
      cause six second Lieutenants of Marines to be landed from the Cerberus and follow Major [John]
      Tuppers Orders; and inclosing their Lordships Order above mentioned relative to stopping and
      searching all Ships coming to or going from America.</P>
   <P>The Nautilus sailed the 20th of last month for the Delaware, where I hope Captain [John]
      Collins will fall in with the Mary and Elizabeth, and Pensilvania Pacquet; and it being a Rule
      to open and read all Letters, I am sure if the above Vessels are met Captain Collins will
      narrowly examine the Letters on board them, and bring those to me that contain any matter
      tending to aid or abet the Rebels, or that give material information of their
      proceedings.2</P>
   <P>I am perfectly satisfied with their Lordship's determination about compensating the Commander
      and Crew of the late Diana for their losses.</P>
   <P>The flat bottommed Boats will be of infinite Service; and their Lordships attention in
      ordering out Coals for the use of the Squadron has relieved me from great anxiety on that
      head.</P>
   <P>The intended reinforcement to the Squadron will I hope enable me to perform every thing that
      can be expected from the Fleet. It has been entirely out of my power to send a Ship to South
      Carolina; the various pressing Services to the Northward have given full employment to every
      Vessel I had, and knowing the Tamer's bad Condition I ordered her to Boston, not doubting that
      I should soon be able to send a Ship in her room. I will endeavour to have Orders ready for
      Captain [Christopher] Atkins by the Time he arrives at <name>Charles Town</name>.</P>
   <P>The Boyne and Asia shall go home upon the arrival of any two of the 50 and 44 Gun Ships: I
      have already mentioned the Somerset being intended to remain this Winter at Halifax. The
      province of <name>Nova Scotia</name> contains many disaffected people, Natives and New Englanders; I have
      reason to apprehend an attempt to destroy his Majesty's Yard and Stores in which the Rebels
      from the Eastern part of Newhampshire would be sure of assistance, not only from the Town and
      Country people, but even from the Artificers of the Yard, who I am told are mostly of this
      province. It is indeed a very serious consideration that those employed in the King's Yard are
      so intimately connected with Rebels that barely by not working they might throw us into many
      difficulties; I dare not suggest what such a Set of Fanatics are further capable of. When
      Commissioner Arbuthnot arrives, and I can send him a proper force for the security of the
      naval Yard and Stores, the Somerset shall return to England, and I hope their Lordships will
      approve of this Resolution. </P>
   <P>My Letters August 17 and 22 of last month contain every thing I can say about the quantity of
      provisions I now have, and my dependance for future supplies. With respect to Stores I will
      carefully observe their Lordships directions to send in my future Letters the Quantities and
      Species that may be necessary for the Squadron. </P>
   <P>The necessity being urgent for having the Fowey repaired and new sheathed, I was exceeding
      glad of the Cerberus to take her place in <name>Charles Town</name> River, that she might go to Halifax;
      And General Gage having upon my application, in consequence of their Lordships Orders,
      embarked some Soldiers on board a Transport to be carried to Halifax for the Security of his
      Majestys Naval Yard, Captain Montagu takes the Transport under his Convoy; They are already at
      Nantasket and will sail the moment the Wind is fair. </P>
   <P>The Adventure Store Ship arrived at Halifax the 27th of August, and the next day Captain Le
      Cras began to unload her, which was done by the 6th of next month; It took four days more to
      put on board again the Stores ordered to be brought here: The Lieut: of the Store Ship having
      charge of the whole to be delivered to the S[t]orekeeper at Halifax unavoidably occasioned
      some delay; Captain <name>Le Cras</name> was obliged to lend Mr Hallum seventeen men, and with that help he
      at length arrived at Boston the 29th of Sepr and I had then the Honor to receive their
      Lordships Order May 29 to take the Adventure under my Command, their Lordships Order May 22 to
      send a Reinforcement of Ships and Vessels to Rear Admiral [Robert] Duff upon his application;

   <P>[Middleborough] Oct. 3, 1775</P>
   <P>Dr. Sir,</P>
   <P>Col. Quincy; . . . In return for the news communicated by your letter I wld. communicate some
      to you if I could. Whether the following be such to you, you can best tell. You have heard of
      Col Gather [?] [Gorham] in the Newfoundland, Governors arrival lately at Boston from England.
      His business hereof I have been informed is to raise and command a Regiment of Rangers to
      distress his country men. My informant is one Clifford, who was Pilot of sd. ship of war
      (Capt. Price) 2 in which Mr Gorham came passenger and arrived in Boston about three weeks ago.
      The Pilot was master of a vessel coming this way from Newfoundland and in Georges bank was
      pressed by Price into his service as Pilot. He says that he was informed at the land that a
      great number of Irishmen about 700 had been enlisted as Rangers to serve against the d--d
      rebels of New England, and supposes that these are for a part of Gorhams regiment. The ship
      you mention going into Boston full of men (not red coats) are probably part of them . . .
      .</P>
   <P>Several Men of War Transports are gone up the sound. On their way they put into Holme's Hole
      and by threatening to cannonade the town forced the inhabitants to give them a few Sheep. They
      also cannonaded Tarpaulin Cove but without effect.</P>
   <P>They had taken among others a vessel of Col. Bowers from Jamaica and a Brig of <name>Harry Bowers</name>
      from the same place with a valuable cargo. The latter got ashore at Elizabeth Island and one
      of the Tenders came after but was so warmly received by the Company stationed there that she
      was obliged to make off, and our people have since carried the Brig safely off into Dartmouth
      with 6 or 7 prisoners . . . . </P>

      from me at boston, as captn [Broderick] Hartwell had no [Ri]te to demand him, for he was my
      proper one, he got himself dischargd out of the Boyne into this schooner by choice, and
      perfectly satisfied, untill I told him of his neglect of Duty at Annapolis Royal, when by his
      not turning out in his watch at four in the morning, I lost my boatswain and four men, and at
      such a time as that when I did not know when I shoud fall inn with the pirate [Jeremiah]
      Obrien, it was Enough to Vex any officer that had any Regard for his Caracter, and I think if
      every midshipman is indulged to go to what Ship the[y] please when the[y] think them selves a
      grieved, it was more than ever I coud do when I was in that station - there is no Contractor

      pence pr pound and Very good the Governor as well as my Self, thinks it will be right to
      supply the people with fresh beef in the harbour t_o preserve the Salt as there is not much in

      wind being to the Eastwd you Sir very well know throws a heavy sea upon our Bar, but not
      withstanding she did not even touch, &amp; Lt [John] Graves who commands her told me she then
      drew Nine foot water - had she been in need of assistance, there is here (belonging to
      Government) a Sixteen Oar'd Launch - a Deck'd Schooner of about fourteen Ton, &amp; a Stout
      open boat, wou'd have been ready to have lightened her, but for Vessels of that Burdthen there
      is no such need wanting; she rides safe at an Anchor opposite the Chief Justices Door - I have
      also a Decked Boat which is always ready, &amp; the Pilots have my leave to command her at a
      moments warning for the publick use, &amp; you may be assured she wou'd have been out had

      Disposal of the Cargo of the Vessel lately taken within your District to the General Court of
      this Colony, to whom he has also recommended the brave Captors for a suitable Compensation. He
      now proposes to equip the Vessels as Ships of War &amp; immediately to Send them on a Cruize,
      or if these Vessels are not fit for the Service to exchange them for others. For which Purpose
      he has dispatched Colo [John] Glover, &amp; as it will not only be a Protection for the Coast
      but probably greatly distress the Enemy, his Excellency requests your kind Assistance to Colo
      Glover in managing this Business -</P>

      Manner; that his Excellency the General does not chuse to meddle with either of the Vessels -
      2 </P>
   <P>You will therefore on Receipt of this take up two other Vessels the most suitable for our
      Purpose upon the best Terms you can - let them be prime Sailors, put them into the best Order
      &amp; loose no Time - A great Number of Transports are hourly expected at Boston from England
      and elsewhere - If you cannot equip them with Guns Suitable from Salem - by going to Newbury
      Port you may find not only a suitable Vessel but have your Choice of Guns for the Purpose. </P>

      Industry at Marblehead, can probably be attributed to the action of the Massachusetts General
      Court, requiring him to sign receipts for the vessels, thus implying they were being leased to
      him, with ownership still vested in the General Court. </P>

   <P>[Boston] 4 [October]</P>
   <P>This day, by his Majesty's <name>Sloop Raven</name>, Captain [John] Stanhope from England, the Admiral
      received his first Orders (dated the 6th of July) to carry on such operations upon the sea
      coasts of the four govemmen[ts] in New England as he should judge most proper for suppressing
      the rebellion now openly avowed and supported in those colonies, and to detain untill his
      Majts pleasure should be known all ships &amp; vessels belonging to the inhabitants of those
      colonies, such only excepted as he shd find, upon good evidence &amp; information, to be bona
      fide the property of persons who had in no shape been concerned in the rebellious proceedings
      within those colonies &amp; had given proof of their attachment to the constitution by
      refusing to concur in the unwarrantable measures which had been adopted to subvert [it,] to
      make such a disposition of the fleet, as that, without crippling the force necessary for the
      service where he commanded in person, a small squadron might be stationed in New York, in
      Delaware bay, in Chesapeak bay, and within the bar of Charlestown, giving the commanders
      instructions to prevent any commerce between the colonies of New York, New Jersey,
      Pensylvania, Virginia Maryland and the Carolinas, and any other places than Great Britain,
      Ireland or his Majs islands in the West Indies, including Bermudas and the Bahamas; to search
      every vessel going into and coming out of any of the Ports of those Colonies, and to seize and
      detain them in every case in which they should make discovery of contraband trade, or
      conveyance of arms and ammunition or military stores of any kind; to receive on board and
      accomodate the Governors or other officers compelled by the violences of the people to seek
      such an azylum, and to afford every protection to his Majesty's subjects who might require it;
      and further to cause it to be publickly signified in all such Seaport towns as were accessible
      to the kings ships that if any violences should hereafter be offered therein to officers of
      the Crown or peaceably disposed subjects, or bodies of men raised &amp; armed or military
      works erected; or attempts made to seize or destroy public magazines of arms ammunition or
      other stores, it would be the duty of the commanders of each of the Squadrons after such
      signification to proceed by the most vigourous methods against the said town as in open
      rebellion. The Admiral however had anticipated these orders, upwards of four months at his own
      peril. </P>

   <P>I hope you will please to pardon my taking the liberty of laying these few lines before your
      excellency, but if I had not I should have thought it would have been doing a great injustice
      to my conscience, &amp; I think every well meaning man who is a real friend to liberty would
      join in my sentiments to stop such outragious actions &amp; rebellious works which are going
      to be put into execution please your Excellency I lived along with Major <name>John Connelly</name> of Fort
      Pitt have done this two years last July he was obliged to retire from <name>Fort Pitt</name> the
      Inhabitants had a suspicion of his being an enemy to his country from thence I went with him
      down to Plymouth in Virginia where he got on Board his Excellency Lord Dunmores ship the Royal
      William where we staid fourteen days &amp; from thence he saild in hi~ Lordships Tender the
      Arundel for Boston with dispatches to General [Thomas] Gage from Lord Dunmore 3 there we staid
      ten days from thence we saild to Newport Rhode Island conveyed by the Viper sloop of War of 12
      guns commanded by Capt <name>Thomas Greaves</name> 4 &amp; from Rhode Island is to be conveyed to New York
      &amp; there the Viper parts with her &amp; she is to Portsmouth by herself. As I was one day
      with the Major in the State room just after we left Boston he asked me if I was willing to go
      with him into the Indian Country as he had been with General Gage to get a commission &amp;
      orders to go into the Indian Countrys to raise the Indians &amp; the French &amp; there is
      some part of the royal Irish I think he said at Fort Chartres &amp; they have orders from
      General Gage to join him &amp; he told me they had nine twelve pounders. But as soon as he
      gets into Virginia &amp; settles his business with his Lordship as he dares not go up the
      country he intends to take his Lordships Tender &amp; to go to St Augqstine &amp; there to get
      guides to convey him through the Cherokees nation &amp; from thence to the Shawneys mineoes
      &amp; Delaways but he is to get Commissions from Lord Dunmore for Capt White Eyes &amp;
      Cornstalk &amp; other of the chiefs &amp; to make them Presents he intends to stay at the
      Detroit all winter in order to get Boats &amp; Canoes built to bring his Forces up the Ohio
      &amp; the Cannon the first place he intends to fall upon is <name>Fort Pitt</name> &amp; to take That &amp;
      then he says that he thinks that most part of that quarter will join him as he says he has
      orders to give them three hundred acres of land to each man that will join him. and another
      scheme he told me he was going to put into execution that is in regard to convicts &amp;
      indentured servants to set them at their liberty &amp; to give them land to join him &amp;
      when he has taken <name>Fort Pitt</name> he intends to proceed down for Alexandria &amp; there he is to be
      reinforced by said Dunmore &amp; some men of War &amp; then to sweep all the Country before
      him. As your Excellency knows what state that Country is in &amp; I thought it most fitting to
      disclose it to your Excellency I wrote the letter in Rhode Island to send down lest I could
      not have had the opportunity of getting from the vessel but I made my escape one night by
      great chance &amp; a young man that was pressed on Board who is now with his parents in Rhode
      Island which the Major wanted to go along with him I left all my cloaths &amp; all that I had
      on Board but that is nothing so I could be of any service to my country &amp; I hope every
      well meaning man god will reward for so doing I hope your Excellency will excuse my Freedom

      Confidence, to impart a Project of raising the People of the Detroit and other Settlers in the

      might make a Diversion on the Frontiers of Pensylvania and Virginia. If his Lordship is able
      to make a stand at the same time in the lower parts of the Country the Project will be of
      great use, and I will do all I can to promote it's success. I have wrote to General Carleton
      upon it, and sent Lord Dunmore Letters for the Commanding Officer and Deputy Indian Agent at
      the Detroit, and also for Captain [Hugh] Lord of the 18th Regiment, ordering him to move the
      Companys of said Regiment from the llinois to the Detroit, and Lord Dunmore will make the best

      the snow Georgia, Capt. [Thomas] Bolton, from Greenock in Scotland, with some passengers for
      this place and a cargo of dry goods for Georgia, was arrived at the Hook in distress, and that
      the captain desired leave to land his passengers and refit his vessel, the Committee gave
      leave for that purpose: And whereas it since appears by the captain's orders, the bills of
      lading, and a letter to said <name>Thomas Buchannan</name> &amp; Co. that the said cargo of dry goods were
      to be landed at this place if the people would receive them, I move that it be</P>

   <P>Mr. [Abraham] Walton then moved (and was seconded by Mr. [Isaac] Low) for the following

      whence she came,&quot; be struck out, and instead thereof, the words, &quot;with her cargo
      without delay,&quot; be inserted; And debates arising on the proposed amendment, it was

      supplies to His Majesty's Ship Asia, had made two previous attempts to be tried or discharged.
      This latest effort, dated City Hall, October 4, 1775, read: &quot;As there are six of us
      confined in jail by your order, charged with misdemeanors, we should take it kind of you if
      you would bring us to immediate trial, or provide for us in our confinement, as we have not

      the Minutes of the Committee of Safety for October 3, 1775. </P>
   <P>4. This letter was received by the Continental Congress on October 9. The proposal was not
      identified by the name of the merchant; it was dated September 27, 1775, and read as follows:
      &quot;About the 1st of July last I sailed from this place bound to Martinico and Guadaloupe,
      amongst the French Islands, provided with necessary letters and interest, with the sole
      intention of procuring a quantity of gunpowder and ammunition for the use of this Colony; but
      on my arrival at those places, found that the whole that could be procured had been bought and
      shipped off in one or two vessels from this place and Philadelphia. During my stay at
      Martinico, as I was particularly recommended to and connected with <name>George Mitchell</name>, Esq.; the
      English agent, a principal merchant there, and interpreter to the Governour; he, in
      confidence, informed me that several of their merchantmen that had sailed for old France, and
      were expected to return about the last of October or the first of November, had carried out
      large orders for powder, and that he expected a large quantity, the most of which would fall
      under his management and disposal, and proposed to supply me with any quantity; and previously
      to my entering into a contract with him, he obtained permission of the Governour for my vessel
      to return there and trade without molestation. In consequence of which he engaged to deliver
      me five tons or upwards, on condition of my return with my vessel-load of flour, about five
      hundred barrels. I therefore request, as you are a member of the Provincial Congress, if you
      think proper to lay this matter before them, to submit the importance of it to their
      consideration; and should they think proper to encourage my completing this contract, and
      grant me a permission to load for that purpose, you are authorized to assure them an ample
      security shall be given for the faithful performance of it; that the same shall be put into
      execution with the greatest despatch, secrecy, and safety, being provided with the completest
      vessel for that purpose, and every other matter necessary to ensure success.&quot; Force,

   <P>If you have not made your Sales there and have Bought any Indigo for this Place or Furrs,
      would Advise your Selling them, if you can without Loss. Indigo is dull here and Furrs are
      wanted, but if you have gone so far in Purchasing a Cargo of said Articles, you may proceed
      here observing to be carefull of Avoiding a Man of War or Cutter, but if you have not taken
      any steps for coming this way we would Advise you to Load with Lumber and go to Hispaniola and
      if the Proffits on a French Cargo to Missis[si]ppi are good and tempting you may return to
      Orleans - but if they are not and times are good here (which you will undoubtedly hear) Load
      with Mollasses or the Best Brown Sugars (or none) and to keep the Vessel by the Stern you may
      put in the Cabbin Coffee to be bought @ 18 [?] D and proceed here and by your Arrival perhaps
      times may be Settled and we may get A bigger Vessel for that Trade or any other good one - if
      you go back from Hispaniola to Orleans think if you can get Indigo @ 7/D and Furrs cheap it
      will be best to proceed Home at all events - but if those Articles are Scarce and dear, Load
      once more with Lumber and go to Hispaniola and from thence get the above mentioned Articles
      and Come home - hope you will be so good as to keep us Informed of your Transactions and

   <P>New-York, October 4,</P>
   <P>By Capt. Little, in eleven days from Charleston, South-Carolina, we are informed, that on the
      15th of September, the commander of his Majesty's ship Tamur, and another armed vessel 1
      pressed two of Capt, Little's men, and two passengers, likewise hands out of all the vessels
      they could come at, on purpose to assist them in taking the cannon from <name>Fort Johnson</name>,2 but
      could not effect their design; the Tamer's barge, with a number of armed men went on shore,
      spiked up some of the cannon, and threw the carriages over the walls; next morning before day
      about 500 of the militia took possession of the Fort, and in a few hours had several of the
      guns mounted again; the Fort is in good repair; the Tamer and the armed vessel very prudently
      withdrew from the reach of the cannon, and fell further down the harbour, where they now lay:
      The Governor 3 is on board one of them. </P>

   <P>I am to acknowledge the Receipt of your favor of the 2d Inst.; informing me that the Ship
      Prince <name>George Capt. Emms</name>, from Bristol to Boston, with Flour for the Enemy, by a mistake of
      her Captain and the Spirited Conduct of some of the Inhabitants was now in your
      Possession.</P>
   <P>I cannot but consider this as a most Providential Event, the State of this Army being alone
      defective in that Article, it would therefore highly Conduce to the Public Interest and to our
      relief, to forward it hither as soon as possible, which I apprehend may be done with Safety
      and ease by Water as far as Salem or Marblehead; in the mean time I will communicate the
      Matter to the Continental Congress for their Direction: as to the Compensation to be made the
      Captors and the determination of what Property arises by the Capture, and in whom Vested.</P>
   <P>What ever Expenses may accrue in Complying with the above Request and whatever risque may be
      run by the Carriage by Water I will engage; but as I do not learn there are any of the Enemy's
      Ships on the Coast, I hope the Risque is very small.</P>

   <P>Camp at Cambridge, October 5, 1775</P>
   <P>I shall now beg leave to request the determination of Congress as to the Property and disposal
      of such Vessels and Cargoes as are designed for the Supply of the Enemy and may fall into our
      Hands. there has been an event of this kind at Portsmouth; as by the Indosure No. 3, 2 in
      which I have directed the Cargo to be brought hither for the use of the Army, reserving the
      Settlement of any Claims of Capture to the decision of the Congress. As there are many
      unfortunate Individuals also, whose property has been Confiscated by the Enemy, I would humbly
      suggest to the Consideration of Congress, the humanity of applying in part, or in the whole
      such Captures to the relief of those Sufferers, after Compensating the Expence of the Captors
      and for their Activity and Spirit. I am the more induced to request this determination may be
      speedy, as I have directed 3 Vessels to be equipped in order to cut off the Supplies, and from
      a Number of Vessels arriving, it may become an Object of some Importance. In the disposal of
      these Captures for the Encouragement of the Officers and Men, I have allowed them 1/3 of the
      Cargo, except Military Stores, which, with the Vessels, are to be reserved for the Public Use.
      I hope my Plan as well as the Execution will be favoured with the approbation of Congress.</P>
   <P>One Mr. Fisk, an intelligent Person, came out of Boston the 3d Instant, and gives us the
      following Advices - That a Fleet consisting of a 64 &amp;. 20 Gun Ship, 2 Sloops of 18 Guns, 2
      Transports with 600 Men were to sail from Boston as yesterday - That they took on Board two
      Mortars, four Howitzers, and other Artillery calculated for the Bombardment of a Town. Their
      Destination was; kept a profound Secret. - 3 That an Express Sloop of War which left England
      the 8th August arrived 4 Days ago - that <name>Genl Gage</name> is recalled, and last Sunday resigned his
      Command to Genl How - that Lord [Hugh] Piercy, Col: [Francis] Smith and other Officers who
      were at Lexington are ordered Home with Gage - tnat 6 Ships of the Line and two Cutters were
      comeing out under Sr <name>Peter Dennis</name> - that 5 Regiments and 1000 Marines are ordered out, and may
      be expected in 3 or 4 Weeks. No Prospect of Accomodation, but the Ministry determined to push
      the War to the utmost. 4</P>
   <P>I have an Express from Col: Arnold and herewith send a Copy of his Letter, and an Inclosure No
      4 &amp; 5. <Sup>5</Sup> I am happy in finding he meets with no Discouragement. . . . The Capt.
      of the Brig from Quebec for Boston 6 informs me there is no Suspicion of any such Expedition,
      &amp; that if Carlton is not drove from <name>St Johns</name>, so as to be obliged to throw himself into
      Quebec,. it must fall into our Hands, as it is left without a Regular Soldier, and many of the
      Inhabitants most favourably disposd to the American Cause - that there is the largest Stock of
      Ammunition ever collected in America.</P>
   <P>In the above Vessel some Letters were also found from an Officer at Quebec to <name>Genl Gage</name>, and
      Major [William] Sheriff at Boston, containing such an Account of the Temper of the Canadians,
      as cannot but afford, the highest Satisfaction. </P>

   <P>By an Intelligent Person from Boston the 3d Inst. I am informed that a Fleet consisting of one
      64, one 20 Gun Ship, 2 Sloops of 18 Guns, two Transports with 600 Men, were to sail from
      Boston as Yesterday, their Destination a profound secret; that they took on board 2 mortars
      and 4 Howitzers with other Artillery, calculated for the Bombardment of a Town. I have thought
      proper to apprize every Considerable Town on the Coast of this Armament that they may be upon
      their guard.</P>
   <P>Should I receive any further Account of their Destination, it shall be forwarded. 2</P>
   <P>The same Person also informs that an Express Sloop arrived 4 Days before from England at
      Boston, which she left the 8th of August. Genl. Gage and most of the officers who were at
      Lexington, are recalled and Sail this day, General [William] Howe succeeds to the Command, 6
      Ships of the Line and 2 Cutters under Sir <name>Peter Dennis</name> [Parker] are coming out, Five Regiments
      and 1000 Marines may be expected at Boston in 3 or 4 Weeks; No prospect of Accomodation, but
      on the other Hand, every appearance of the War being pushed with the utmost Vigour.</P>

   <P>Last Monday [October 2] arrived in Piscataqua River a ship from England, intended for Boston.1
      It appears that the Day before her Arrival she was in Company with the Raven, Man of War,
      bound to the same Place, but parted with her in the Night. Meeting with a Fisherman, to the
      Eastward of Cape-Ann, the Crew requested some Directions what Course to steer for Boston; the
      honest Fisherman, pointing towards Piscataqua River, tells them, there is Boston. The Crew
      shape their Course accordingly, and soon very luckily found themselves, with their Ship and.
      Cargoe, under the Guns of a Battery lately built by the People of New Hampshire. The Commander
      of the Battery, with a Number of Men, very humanely goes on board to their Assistance, and
      offers to pilot the Ship up to Portsmouth. I can't go there - says the Captain of the Ship - I
      am bound to Boston. But you must, replies the other; And immediately ordered her to be got
      under Way, and soon carried her safe into a Wharf, where she was taken proper Care of by the
      People of Portsmouth. She had been out 11 Weeks from Bristol in England, and had on board 1800
      Barrels and 400 Half Barrels of Flour, for the Use of the beseiged Army in Boston. </P>

      this Morning and which was written before that marked No l. I now do myself the Honor to
      transmit you.2</P>
   <P>I am very apprehensive of disagreeable Consequences arising from Mr. [Ethan] Allen's
      Imprudence. I always dreaded his Impatience of Subordination, and it was not till after a
      solemn Promise made me in the Presence of several Officers that he would demean himself
      properly that I would permit him to attend the Army. Nor would I have consented then had not
      his Solicitations been backed by several Officers</P>
   <P>By the enclosed Return No 7 - Congress will perceive what Troops have joined the Army since I
      left it and what Provisions &amp;Ca. have been forwarded to It, - the Canadians destroy great
      Quantities of Provisions, and much Waste is comitted by our People, In Despight of every Order
      issued to prevent It, - the Expence of this Article will amaze Congress, however if the
      issuing Commissaries had done their Duty and Obeyed the Orders that were given them by the
      Commissary General or me, I should have had it in my Power to have detected every Quarter
      Master or Other who has drawn greater Quantities of Provision than what was due, and the
      Regiments might have been charged with it.</P>
   <P>Such Crouds of sick are daily returning from the Army that altho' I had Thoughts of leaving
      General Wooster's Corps at Albany, I have found it necessary to order them up, -</P>
   <P>I wish I could comply with General Montgomery's Requisition for Ammunition, But I have not an
      Ounce of Powder that I can Command nor do I expect any unless the New York Congress can send

      Employment, as he is apprehensive that he will not be able again to cross the Lakes. - I am
      fully convinced that it will be the Case, but as a New Appointment during this Campaign, will
      be introductory of Confusion, I have requested him to return to Albany &amp; have taken the
      Liberty to Give him an Order to appoint a Deputy </P>
   <P>The Pay master General's Appointment I understand will not afford of his Paying a Deputy I
      mention this that Congress may signify their Pleasure on the Subject. </P>
   <P>Should Congress approve of having the Troops that are, or have been employed in this
      Department paid by Rolls drawn in the Form of the inclosed, It will be necessary, that I
      should be furnished with the Accounts of what Pay only has been advanced to them, for which
      Purpose an Order should go to the Governor of Connecticut, Massachusetts Bay Congress, that of
      New York and that of New Hampshire to furnish me with the Accounts, specifying the Persons
      Names to whom Money has been advanced by their Order. </P>
   <P>On farther Consideration, I find this Order will be necessary even if Congress should not
      think proper to adopt my Mode of Payment, for I labour under Difficulties in Complying with
      Applications for Money as I do not know but I may overrun the Mark. </P>
   <P>The first One hundred thousand Dollars issued to Mr [Jonathan] Trumbull are expended, and as I
      shall have large Calls on me from Canada and other Quarters I beg leave to mention the
      Necessity there is of a fresh supply to the Military Chest in this Department. </P>
   <P>I am rather better than when I did Myself the Honor to write you last, having Yesterday for
      the first Time ventured to ride out two or three hundred Yards. </P>
   <P>Should I receive Your Orders to engage Troops for the Winter Services, I propose to give the
      offers of Commissions to the Officers of the Army as they stand in Rank (unless your direct
      otherwise) Which I hope will be agreeable</P>

   <P>2. <name>John Adams</name>, in his Autobiography (The Works of <name>John Adams</name>, III, 6-8; hereafter cited as
      Adams, <name>John Adams</name>), presents an interesting account of the debate centering around the
      resolutions of that day, as follows: </P>
   <P>The secretary has omitted to insert the names of this committee on the journals, but as my
      memory has recorded them, they were Mr. Deane, Mr. Langdon, and myself, three members who had
      expressed much zeal in favor of the motion. As a considerable part of my time, in the course
      of my profession, had been spent upon the sea-coast of Massachusetts, in attending the courts
      and lawsuits at Plymouth, Barnstable, Martha's Vineyard, to the southward, and in the counties
      of Essex, York, and Cumberland to the eastward, I had conversed much with the gentlemen who
      conducted our cod and whale fisheries, as well as the other navigation of the country, and had
      heard much of the activity, enterprise, patience, perseverance, and daring intrepidity of our
      seamen. I had formed a confident opinion that, if they were once let loose upon the ocean,
      they would contribute greatly to the relief of our wants, as well as to the distress of the
      enemy. I became therefore at once an ardent advocate for this motion, which we carried, not
      without great difficulty. The opposition to it was very loud and vehement. Some of my own
      colleagues appeared greatly alarmed at it, and Mr. <name>Edward Rutledge</name> never displayed so much
      eloquence as against it. He never appeared to me to discover so much information and sagacity,
      which convinced me that he had been instructed out-of-doors by some of the most knowing
      merchants and statesmen in Philadelphia. It would require too much time and space to give this
      debate at large, if any memory could attempt it. Mine cannot. It was, however, represented as
      the most wild, visionary, mad project that ever had been imagined. It was an infant, taking a
      mad bull by his horns; and what was more profound and remote, it was said it would ruin the
      character, and corrupt the morals of all our seamen. It would make them selfish, piratical,
      mercenary, bent wholly upon plunder; &amp;c. &amp;c. These formidable arguments and this
      terrible rhetoric were answered by us by the best reasons we could allege, and the great
      advantages of distressing the enemy, supplying ourselves, and beginning a system of maritime
      and naval operations, were represented in colors as glowing and animating. The vote was
      carried, the committee went out, returned very soon, and brought in the report in these words: </P>
   <P>Here Adams inserted the long resolution of that day. </P>
   <P>3. The Massachusetts armed vessels, to which the committee referred, were the schooner
      Diligent and sloop Machias Liberty, commanded respectively by <name>Jeremiah O'Brien</name> and Benjamin
      Foster. Washington, as will be noted later, reported that Massachusetts had no vessels
      available for the enterprise since Diligent and Machias Liberty were based on Machias, and
      only nominally under the direction of the Massachusetts General Court. </P>
   <Title><name>JOHN ADAMS</name>' NOTES OF DEBATES IN THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS 1</Title>
   <P>[Philadelphia] Octr. 5.</P>
   <P>Gadsden. I wish we may confine ourselves to one Point. Let the Point be whether We shall shut
      up all our Ports, and be all on a footing. The Ministry will answer their End, if We let the
      Custom houses be open; in N. Y., N. C., the lower Counties and Georgia. They will divide us.
      One Colony win envy another, and be jeaJous. Mankind act by their feelings. Rice sold for £3 -
      it wont sell now for 30s. We have rich and poor there as in other Colonies. We know that the
      excepted Colonies dont want to take Advantage of the others.</P>
   <P>Zubly. Q. whether the Custom houses be stopped, and the Trade opened to all the World. The
      object is so great that I would not discuss it, on Horse back, riding Post haste. It requires
      the debate of a Week. We are lifting up a Rod - if you dont repeal the Acts, We will open our
      Ports.</P>
   <P>Nations as well as Individuals are sometimes intoxicated. It is fair to give them Notice. If
      We give them Warning, they will take Warnirig. They will send Ships out. Whether they can stop
      our Trade, is the Question. <name>N. England</name> I leave out of the Question. N.Y. is stopped by one
      Ship. Philadelphia says her Trade is in the Power of the fleet. V[irginia] and Maryland, is
      within the Capes of Virginia. <name>N. Carolina</name> is accessible. Only one good Harbour, Cape Fear. In
      G[eorgia] We have several Harbours, but a small naval Force may oppose or destroy all the
      naval Force of Georgia.</P>
   <P>The Navy can stop our Harbours and distress our Trade. Therefore it is impracticable, to open
      our Ports. </P>
   <P>The Q. is whether we must have Trade or not. We cant do without Trade. We must have Trade. It
      is prudent not to put Virtue to too serious a Test. I would use American Virtue, as sparingly
      as possible lest We wear it out. </P>
   <P>Are We sure one Cano will come to trade? Has any Merchant received a Letter from Abroad, that
      they will come. Very doubtfull and precarious whether any French or Spanish Vessell would be
      cleared out to America. It is a Breach of the Treaty of Peace. The Spaniards may be too lazy
      to come to America. They may be supplied from Sicily. It is precarious, and dilatory -
      extreamly dangerous - and pernicious. </P>
   <P>Christopher Gadsden. By Rembrandt Peale, c. 1795-97. </P>
   <P>I am clearly vs. any Proposition to open our Ports to all the World. It is not prudent to
      threaten.</P>
   <P>The People of England will take it we design to break off, to separate. We have Friends in
      Eng. who have taken this up, upon virtuous Principles. </P>
   <P>Lee. I will follow Mr. Gadsden and simplify the Proposition, and confine it to the Q. whether
      the Custom houses shall be shut? If they are open, the excepted Colonies may trade, others
      not, which will be unequal. The Consequence Jealousy, Division and Ruin. I would have all
      suffer equally. But We should have some Offices, set up, where Bonds should be given that
      Supplies shall not go to our Enemies. </P>

   <P>I laid that Part of your Honors Letter relative to the proposed Voyage and your first Letter
      upon the same Subject before the Comee of Secresy &amp; I am instructed to acquaint you. That
      they approve of the Plan and in Behalf of the united Colonies agree to advance a sufficient
      Sum of continental Money to purchase sixty or eighty Tons of good Gun Powder as suits you
      best, to run the Risque of the Money &amp; Powder the Persons intrusted behaving with Fidelity
      and to give the same Commissions &amp; Freight which they give to other Persons for the like
      Service which you may rely upon to be a handsome Compensation for the Service: The money shall
      be paid to your Order on Sight, The Committee make it a Rule when they advance Money to take
      good Bonds for the faithful Performance of the Contract on the Part of those who receive it,
      your Honor will be pleased to take such Bonds if you should advance the Mon~y for the Voyage
      until we can replace it with continental money; the Bonds must be made payable to Thomas
      Willing <name>Benjamin Franklin</name> <name>Philip Livingston</name> John Alsop Silas Dean, <name>John Dickerson</name>, John
      Langdon Thomas McKean &amp; <name>Samuel Ward</name> Esqrs in Trust for &amp; to the use of the thirteen
      united Colonies in North America; The Condition that the money shall be faithfully laid out in
      France for good Gunpowder upon the best Terms &amp; delivered to the above Comee for the use
      of the sd united Colonies in some Part of the Colonies of Rhode Island or Connecticut the
      Danger of the Seas &amp; Enemies excepted: If the whole Quantity of Gun Powder cannot be got
      the Comee would have as much Salt Petre with a proportionate Quantity of Sulphur to
      manufacture with it purchased as will make up the proposed Quantity of Powder the Bonds may
      specify that &amp; also that if the Powder Salt Petre &amp; Sulphur cannot be had as above
      directed that the Money shall be returned to the Comee abovesd. </P>
   <P>The Comee would have waited for your particular Terms upon which the Voyage should have been
      undertaken but thought it would occasion a Delay of several Weeks &amp; probably frustrate the
      Voyage, they therefore directed Me to propose to your Honor if hard money or good Bills of
      Exchange can be got, immediately to procure the same &amp; dispatch the Vessel as soon as
      possible </P>
   <P>It is expected that Provisions will be allowed to be exported to foreign Countries agreable to
      the non exportation Agreement, if so the Money may be laid out here in flour at a low Rate. </P>
   <P>If the Voyage cannot be undertaken without the Moneys being first sent from hence or if any
      other unforseen Event retards it let Capt Hopkins come here immediately or acquaint us with it
      in any other Way &amp; every thing reasonable on our Parts shall be done to expedite the

      go to advance the Money for two thousand stands of good Arms &amp; five thousand good double
      bridled Gunlocks. Nothing of this matter ought to transpire save to the concerned if these

   <P>A few days ago lord Dunmore, in consequence of a piece in the Norfolk Intelligencer, commanded
      about a dozen of his men to go and seize the publisher of that paper, as also all his
      materials. The printer fortunately escaped, but they succeeded in their other attempt, and
      carried every article belonging to him on board the man of war. - Shameful as the proceedings
      of these harpies were, we forbear, at present, to insert a single syllable against the people
      of Norfolk; time, however, will evince whether they acted in this affair becoming the
      character of freemen, or whether pusillanimity had not too great a share in their conduct.</P>
   <P>Lord Dunmore, we hear, has, in a taunting manner, promised the inhabitants of Norfolk that
      they shall sustain no great injury by the loss of their printer, as he will execute any thing
      in that way for them which they may please to send to him. But here, too, his lordship may
      fail, as it is reported he did in a certain other duty; though probably, by sending for his
      Minden hero (his old speech writer, &amp;c. &amp;c.) 1 he may procure some aid. - Suppose,
      then, [Edward] Foy to be his foreman, would not [Matthew] Squire make an excellent printer's

      persuaded) would flock to it immediately, they allege that this is the only means by which
      they can be Secured from the danger, with which they are hourly threatened by the Rebels; I
      could have had no difficulty of directly complying with their request, but the want of Arms
      and Ammunition to supply them with; I have advised them (without giving them any particular
      reason) to remain as quiet as possible for a Short time, when I hope I shall be in a Situation

      wholelly employed in exciting, in the minds of all Ranks of People the Spirit of Sedition and
      Rebellion by the grosest missrepresentation of facts, both public and private; that they might
      do no further Mischief I sent a Small party on Shore, on Saturday last [September 30] at Noon
      and brought off their press Tipes, Paper, Ink, two of the Printers and all the Utensils, and
      am now going to have a Press for the King on board one of the Ships I have lately taken into
      His Majesty's Service for the reception of the remainder of the 14th Regiment whoes arrival I
      look for with great impatience every hour. My having Seized their Press &amp;c produced the
      inclosed papers No 1 &amp; 2. 2 </P>
   <P>I am just now well informed that the Ordnance I mentioned to your Lordship in my letter No 28.
      that the Rebells had Seized belonging to His Majesty are now Mounting on field Carriges at
      Williamsburg and a great number of Ball casting for them at their foundaries, and that they
      have just now received by Land from Baltimore in Maryland three and twenty hundred Weight of
      Gunpowder which they got from the West Indies; the Men of War have three tenders out now
      Cruising for two Schooners and a Sloop that I have intelligence of that are expected from the
      same quarter with powder, two of which are bound to Baltimore, the other for this Colony one
      of the former is Armed; thus <name>My Lord</name> do I see every hour His Majesty's Enemies puting
      themselves in the best posture of defence possible, without having it in my power to give them
      the least interruption, and I give your Lordship leave to judge if this is not to the greatest
      degree gauling, when certain too that a very small force well applied now. would not only
      effectually frustrate all their Schemes for the present, but soon reduce the whole of his
      Southern part of His Majesty's Continent to a proper State of submission; I do beg and.intreat
      your Lordship that I may not long remain an inactive Spectator of such unwarrantable
      proceedings. </P>
   <P>Mr Collins of His Majesty's Armed Schooner the Magdalen before he left this place had Seized a
      Small Sloop which was condemned in the Court of Admiralty but the People had orders from their
      Committees not to purchase her, she was left here with me together with another under the same
      predicament, by Mr Collins when he was ordered Home, I have ever since employed them as

      where nothing but small Craft can go, with an Officer and Six Men or eight Men on board, who
      to Save themselves were obliged to take to the Woods, the Officer very narrowly escaped with
      some of the People but several of the others were taken and thrown in to Goal, and after
      undergoing many examination by these Committee Men were discharged as they proved that they
      had been pressed some Short time before, they took out of the Sloop Six of His Majesty's
      Swivells a Scene [seine] &amp;c &amp;c and then burnt Her; We have demanded Satisfaction of
      the People at Hampton for the Sloop and desired that the King's Stores might be returned, to
      all which they have given us a positive refusal; their Port is now blocked up and we have
      taken two of their Boats and shall not permit a Vessell to pass or repass till they return the

   <P>Dear General,</P>
   <P>Octr 6th 1775. </P>
   <P>Your Dilligence and Foresight have saved us from the Difficulties that threatned us. We are no
      longer afraid of starving. I wait now with Impatience for the Arrival of those Troops
      mentioned in your last, and which I believe from the Number of Boats on the Way will soon be
      here to take the advantageous Post I formerly spoke of on a Hill to the Westward. Since my
      last I have had some Proposals of an Accomodation through the Channel of the Caghnawagas from
      the formidable <name>St Luke</name> le Corne and other principal Inhabitants of Montreal. Tomorrow is
      appointed for a Conference at Lapraire. I have sent Major [John] Brown to manage it.
      Macpherson goes with him, and Mr Livingston of Chamblee will attend. The Result of this
      Negotiation I hope soon to make you acquainted with. Mr <name>St Luke</name>'s Character gives me all the
      Reason in the World to be on my Guard against him. I shall insist on some substantial Proof of
      his Sincerity. Mr Livingston some Days ago took Post at Mr [Moses] Hazen's House with near 250
      Canadians. They are erecting a Battery there which seems to make the Garrison very uneasy.
      Yesterday they attacked them with their Row Galley but were beaten back without Loss on the
      Side of the Canadians. No certain Intelligence yet of Arnold's Arrival, tho there are flying
      Reports to that Purpose. I wish he was at Quebec with all my Heart, I believe there is Nothing
      to oppose him. I am extremely happy that you have sent for more Powder. I believe we have not
      more than two Tons &amp; a Half. This I am afraid will not do. Send as many Men as you
      possibly can furnish with Provisions. I am greatly in Want of them. Our Feebleness has
      intimidated the Canadians from embarking in so uncertain an Adventure. Were I strong enough to
      send 500 Men to Montreal, it would certainly declare for us, at least I have great Reason to
      think. The miserable Weather we have had, has distressed us much, but I hope it is now over. </P>
   <P>Let the hard Cash come up as soon as possible, that our Reputation may hold good. Mr Carleton
      is not departed, as I informed you.</P>
   <P>We want both Iron &amp; Steel, &amp; Turners Tools. The large Mortar is ready to play. I
      am&amp;c</P>

   <P>Camp Before <name>St Johns</name> October 6th 1775</P>
   <P>Ever since the Seventeenth of Last month we have Laid Siege to this Place, tis a very
      Difficult Place to Come at, as it is almost Surrounded with Sunken Swamps &amp; Marshy ground,
      Many Small Occurrences have Happen'd During the Siege which I Cannot recapitulate, the Enemy
      it is Thought have fired 600 Bomshels besides numbers of Cannon Shot &amp; Showers of Grape
      shot, but we have Lost but about a Dozn men by them all - They Played very severely on us when
      we were Erecting our Battery's I was for three Days Successively where the Shot &amp; Shells
      Came &amp; the grape Shot ratled round me Like hail, But a Good God has Preserv'd me - I had
      Several times the Dirt Spatterd all over me by the Shells &amp; shot but None have hitherto
      hit me, the Extreme rainy Season &amp; our very wet and Muddy Camp makes it much unhealthy,
      some Days ago I was orderd to Go round &amp; Reconnoitre on the Northwest part of the fort,
      where we are Going to Erect a Gun Battery in order to make a Breach &amp; storm the place If
      it Can be Conquerd no other way (which I Look upon the Attempt Dangerous &amp; The Event
      Dubious) In going to Reconnotre I Crawld upwithin Musket Shot of the Enemy's Batterys &amp;
      observ'd their Movements; in Doing of which I was Oblig'd more than once to be knee Deep in
      water &amp; it being rainy I Was wet from head to foot from Early in the Morning till ten
      o'Clock at Night by which I got a great Cold &amp; have not been well Since, I have been Laid
      Up for Several Days from business only that I keep about, but find it too Hard for my
      Constitution, Colo [Ethan] Allen has been very Servicable in bringing In the Cannadians &amp;
      Indians, But being Encouraged by some others, he Has rather Contrary to his own Judgment
      Cross'd the River about five Miles below Montreal with only about 30, New Englan'd men &amp;
      70 Cannadian Friends 100 in the whole &amp; Intended to Augment his Number of Cannadians &amp;
      if Possible get Possession of Montreal, But he was the Next Morning Met by <name>St Luke</name> Lucorn with
      about 400 Regulars &amp; french Tories - They Over Power'd Allen, &amp; he is Either kill'd or
      Taken with About 20 of His men (which was a Severe stroke to us) he however made some havock
      he Stood his ground firing till they Surrounded him altho his men forsook him, The Town Major
      of Montreal with some other of the most potent Tories were kill'd in the Engagement.-</P>
   <P>On the 3rd Instant, There was a Severe Engagement Between the french whigs On one Side &amp;
      the french Tories &amp; Regulars on the Other side, at Chamble about 13 miles from this place,
      The Tory Party had the Advantage as they fired about Fifty Cannon shot on our Whigs when they
      had only small arms to Defend With They Lost Several men on Each side, The Whigs maintaind
      their ground; In Short tis a Melancholly Prospect to see; that all Cannada is in one Continued
      Scene of War &amp; Bloodshed, if we Dont Carry our Point we have brought Cannada into the Most
      Deplorable Situation Possibie to Conceive, as those people Who have Taken arms in our favour
      with their Wifes &amp; Children will be Left to Cruelty without Mercy; &amp; any of our army
      will hardly Escape with Safety Tis amazing to me that the Colony's should have so Little Sense
      of the Importance of This Expedition as not to give us a good Large Army, well Furnish'd in
      Due Season, which Indeed would have nearly Setled the Controversy, but we have never yet been
      2000 Strong Exclusive of our friends of Cannada, altho' we Assume to ourselves all the Airs of
      a potent Army. on the 4th Instant the Enemy hauld off an Armed Vessel to the East side, when
      with her and a Large Schooner &amp; the Cannon Of The fort, They began a heavy Cannonading
      &amp; Bombarding on our Camp And Batterys But principally Aim'd at a Party of about 200 or 250
      of our Cannadian friends who are Intrenching themselves on the East Side on which Our
      Gundaloes &amp; Battery's Returnd the fire &amp; the Cannadians Pour'd in a fire Of Musquetry,
      on the Enemy, &amp; a party from our Camp Commanded by Colo [Timothy] Bedel, Likewise Came up
      &amp; fired upon them, which made the Enemy Retire To their Den, the firing of Cannon &amp;
      Musquetry was warm for about half An hour, our Cannadian friends Maintain'd their ground &amp;
      kill'd some of The Enemy with the Loss of only one man Slightly wounded with a grapeshot </P>
   <P>I have been present with the General at a Congress &amp; Treaty with the Indians where the
      Heads of all the Seven Nations of Cannada were present &amp; matters Were Conducted with Great
      Solemnity &amp; to the Mutual Satisfaction of all </P>
   <P>Yesterday <name>St Luke</name> Lucorn (that Arch Devil Incarnate who has Butcher'd hundreds men women &amp;
      Children of our Colony, in the Late war in the Most Inhuman Manner) who has Ever been a head
      &amp; Leader of the Cannadians and All the Indians, now finding that Notwithstanding all his
      Wiles &amp; falsehoods The Indians &amp; More than half the Cannadians are become friendly to
      Us, He has now sent a Message to us Desiring a Conference with us, the General has agreed to a
      Conference to be held at LePraire tomorrow Major Brown &amp; the Aide Camp on our Side, &amp;
      that wretch <name>St Luke</name> with the Principal Leaders of the Tory faction of Montreal on the other
      side, Tis a very Delicate Embassy &amp; the Consequences will better manifest the Event, than
      it Can Be Guess'd, - The Indians of all the Tribes &amp; the Cannadians who Joyn Us have all
      Learn'd English Enough to say Liberty, &amp; Bostonian, and All Call themselves Yankee's, the
      Indians Boast much of it, &amp; will smite On their Breasts Saying, 'me yankee,' -</P>
   <P>It is very Grievous to me that General Schuyler is not here I had a very Good understanding
      with Him &amp; a Good agreement in all the Modes of Prosecuting the Expedition but to my
      Sorrow &amp; the Embarrassment Of the Service there is not that good understanding as I Could
      wish now General Montgomrys Chief Confident is one Colo [Donald] Campbell a Scotchman who Has
      been an Officer in the Regulars &amp; is now Depy Qr Mr Gen I &amp; very profane I should be
      Very sorry to Inform your Honr that there is Scarcely a word heard from Head Quarters without
      some Oaths &amp; Curses on Every Occation, but I Vallue Myself on the Righteousness of the
      Cause, &amp; hope in God for Success. </P>
   <P>I have no Great Opinion of Montgomry's Generalship altho I believe him To be a Man of Courage
      that is but a small (tho' Essensial) Qualification of a General, for all the Pretensions of
      New York there has not been One Head Colo of a Regiment, seen in the Army this year, &amp; out
      of Their 3500 Men we have never had more than 600 Down here, until within this 4 Days there
      has Come between 2 &amp; 300 more, I Recollect nothing more Material, The firing goes on now
      pretty Briskly the Enemy are very Strongly fortified, The Event of Each Day Can only be told
      or even Guess'd at the Close of it, I am Sir with all Defference &amp; Respect [&amp;c.] </P>

      Mortars Shells and other Artillery Stores, and these being obtained with much difficulty at
      different periods notwithstanding the Admiral made several applications for them in person to
      the General, much more time was consumed in this Equipment than if the Business had received
      that ready assistance from all concerned which such an Undertaking might expect and required:
      and the taking Artillery Stores quietly off by Night, to prevent our intentions being

   <P>Whereas the four New England Governments are in open an avowed Rebellion against his Majesty,
      and they have been daring enough to make Seizures of several of his Majesty's Ships and
      Vessels, and to send the Crews to Prison, and have also have fired upon killed and wounded
      many of the Kings Subjects serving on board his Majesty's Ships; And whereas there is
      undoubted Intelligence of their fortifying their Sea Ports, and of their determination to cut
      off and destroy his Majesty's Subjects serving in his Fleet and Army whenever it is in their
      Power. </P>
   <P>And whereas I have caused the Symmetry Transport and Spitfire Sloop to be armed and fitted in
      the best manner the Situation of our Affairs would admit in order to proceed along the Coast,
      and lay waste burn and destroy such Seaport Towns as are accessible to his Majesty's Ships;
      And whereas from your having been employed many years on the Survey of the Coast to the
      Eastward of this Harbour, you cannot but be qualified to carry on this Service from your
      knowledge of all the Harbours, Bays, Creeks, Shoals, and having full confidence in your
      integrity, Loyalty and Naval Experience, and in particular for your late spirited and
      judicious Conduct at Falmouth, I have thought proper that you should command on this
      Expedition: You are therefore hereby required and directed to take the Symmetry and Spitfire
      under your Command together with his Majesty's Schooner Halifax, and proceed with them as soon
      as possible to <name>Cape Anne</name> Harbour, that Town having fired in the month of August last upon his
      Majesty's Sloop Falcon, wounded her People and taken many Prisoners; you are to burn destroy
      and lay waste the said Town together with all Vessels and Craft in the Harbour that cannot
      with Ease be brought away. Having performed this Service you are to take the advantage of Wind
      and Weather, or any other favorable Circumstances, to fall upon and destroy any other Towns or
      places within the Limits aforesaid, and all Vessels or Craft to seize and destroy. </P>
   <P>My Design is to chastize Marblehead, Salem, Newbury Port, <name>Cape Anne</name> Harbour, Portsmouth,
      Ipswich, Saco, Falmouth in Casco Bay, and particularly Mechias where the Margueritta was
      taken, the Officer commanding her killed, and the People made Prisoners, and where the
      Diligent Schooner was seized and the Officers and Crew carried Prisoners up the Country, and
      where preparations I am informed are now making to invade the Province of <name>Nova Scotia</name>. </P>
   <P>You are to go to all or to as many of the above named Places as you can, and make the most
      vigorous Efforts to bum the Towns, and destroy the Shipping in the Harbours. And as the Number
      of Marines you carry in the Vessels are too few to land and maintain any Post, you are to be
      careful not to risque their Lives or the Lives of any of your People by attempting where there
      is not great probability of Success, but to content yourself with falling upon the Rebels,
      doing what you can with Expedition and coming away before they can assemble to cut off your
      Retreat, and never risque your Ships aground or where you cannot put to Sea at all times of
      Tide, Wind permitting. </P>
   <P>You are to bestow your whole attention to annoying the Rebels and the Security of your own
      Vessels; to observe in all your operations the strictest discipline, not to suffer plundering
      upon any Account, as I will make an Example of whoever shall presume to be guilty of it. </P>
   <P>Whenever you can distinguish the persons or property of those who have taken no part in the
      rebellion and have given proofs of their Attachment to the Constituti[on] by refusing to
      concur in the unwarrantable measures that have been adopted to subvert it, you are to protect
      and defend them to the utmost of your power. </P>
   <P>I leave entirely to your own discretion where to go and when to return, relying upon your Zeal
      for his Majesty's Service and the good of your Country for the steady and effectual Execution
      of these Orders.</P>

   <P>Gentlemen - Capt. <name>Robert Wallace</name>; in the brig Mary, sailed from Baltimore, in Maryland, the

      on the 23d; she is bound to Falmouth for orders, and put in here by distress, and wants

      to by the Asia, ship of war in our harbour, who has pressed six of his men, but has promised
      to return them, or supply him with others in their stead. The captain of this brig has applied
      to us for leave to come into this harbour to unload and refit, and when she is repaired she
      may be allowed to prosecute her intended voyage. From principles of humanity we consented to
      his coming to unload and repair; but shall give no further order until we are favoured with

      committing Hostilities vs. Virginia, and has extended his Piracies to Maryland. I wish he had
      been seized, by the Colony months ago. They would have received the Thanks of all North
      America. Is it practicable now? Have the Committee any naval Force? This order will be a mere
      Piece of Paper. Is there a Power in the Committee to raise and pay a naval Force? Is it to be
      done at the Expence of the Continent. Have they Ships or Men? </P>
   <P>Lee. I wish Congress would advise Virginia and Maryland to raise a force by sea to destroy
      Lord Dunmore's power. He is fond of his bottle, and may be taken by land, but ought to be
      taken at all events. </P>

   <P>In Septr 1775 Willing Morris &amp; Co entered into a Contract with the Secret Committee and
      received 45000 Dollars in advance thereon, Mr <name>Wm Duncan</name> a Worthy Active Young Gentleman of the
      City of Philada was jointly Concerned in this Contract tho not named. We bought the Ship Duke
      of Yark3, Capt Higgins &amp; sent her for Hamburg in Ballast the said Mr Duncan going
      passenger in order to execute the Contract carrying with him bills drawn by Willing Morris
      &amp; Co in order to make the purchases. But Willing Morris &amp; Co having supplyed Bills on
      London at different times to a considerable Amount for the Public use, &amp; not being able to
      buy others to replace their Money in Europe; made application for leave to Export Provisions
      (during the time of the prohibition) on the Continental Account . . . the design being to
      replace for WM &amp; Co in Europe the Money they had drawn for, to serve the Public and the
      Money Mr Duncan was to lay out in Hamburg . . . but it unfortunately happened that the Ship
      Duke of York Cap Higgins has never been heard of &amp; Mr Duncan must have perished in her.
      this of course prevented the execution of this Contract </P>

      Names, view each of them separately, examine whether they be actually fit for their Respective
      Duty, and see that their Numbers, Conditions, and abilities, agree with the Returns made by

      Privates belonging to the Boats, examine whether the time which they have been in the Service
      be truly stated, with their ranks, and certify the same accordingly. And all officers and

   <P>I take this Opportunity to acquaint you that I anchor'd under the Fox Islands with his
      Majesty's Ship under my Command and all the Convoy on the 27th Sepr at 7 P.M. the Wind S b E.
      It blew strong that Night and all the next day; the day following Captain Payne had a
      Conference with the People on shore, at first they appeared little inclined to let us have
      their Wood; but on our assuring them they should be satisfied for whatever we had from them,
      they soon grew more flexible, and we got off about 20 Cord, the rest that they had cut not
      being drawn out of the Woods; nor dare they hawl it out for fear of being destroyed by Col.
      [James] Cargill and his Ruffians from the Main; without we ordered them so to do, which Order
      we soon gave, and they promised to act accordingly; and the next day I anchored here (Long
      Island) with the Ships, where I found the People under the same Terror, but on our giving them
      every Assurance of our intention to pay for the Wood we had from them, with positive
      Directions to hawl their Wood to the Shore, they complied; and we have now two Ships loaded;
      two more will be finished Tomorrow and by Tuesday hope to finish three more, and by the end of
      the next Week we have a Prospect of getting them all loaded if not disturbed by a Visit from
      Cargill who we are told intends us that favor. As we have given these People the strongest
      Assurances that they shall be paid for their Wood before we leave them; and Capt. Payne not
      being provided with Cash or Goods sufficient for that purpose, I am at his request induced to
      send the Sloop (that brings this) to Boston with his Letters to General [James] Robertson, to
      forward to him by an armed Vessel and a Transport without loss of time money and goods to
      satisfy these People, and should the same not arrive by the time the Ships are loaded I shall
      be under the necessity of leaving the Spy here 'till the same arrives; These People are very
      poor and in great want of almost all the necessaries of life, and I must think it will be of
      the greatest Consequence to the Kings Service (so far as relates to a Supply of Wood for the
      Garrison at Boston) that the utmost Dispatch should be made in sending the money or articles
      Captain Payne has wrote for.</P>
   <P>Last Night I was informed an Embarkation, on board which were 1500 Men under the Command of
      Col. Arnold, arrind at Kennebeck the end of last Week from the Eastward; and that they are
      gone up the River in Whale Boats and Batteaux and are destined for Canada: this Account may be
      relied on. </P>
   <P>I have stoped a Schooner from Piscatagua to load Wood, which Schooner I intend bringing with
      me to Boston; And herewith you will receive the State and Condition of his Majesty's Ship
      under my Command I am &amp;c </P>

   <Title>PORTSMOUTH COMMITTEE TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRe COMMITTEE OF SAFETY 1</Title>
   <P>Gentlemen: - Committee Hall [Portsmouth] October 7, 1775. On the 2d day of this month, the
      Ship Prince George, of which <name>Richard Emmes</name> is master put into this harbour from Bristol, b~und
      to Boston, loaded with one thousand eight hundred and ninety-two barrels of flour. Upon notice
      of her arrival Lieutenant <name>Thomas Pickering</name> with a boat and hands, by order of Captain Titus
      Salter, went on board, and finding the said provisions were intended for the use of Gage's
      Army, he took her into possession, and brought her up to this Town, and unbent the sails, and
      applied to this Committee, on the 3d day of this month. Messrs. <name>S. Sherburne</name>, <name>P. Long</name> and G.
      Wentworth; all of this Committee, were appointed to unload her; and as the Town is in great
      want of flour, they were desired to make sale of fifty barrels for cash, and to supply the
      fort therewith; but before they had accomplished it, the vote was reconsidered, and ordered
      that no part of the cargo should be taken out till the advice of the Committee of Safety for
      the Province was taken thereupon. And we wrote at the same time to General Washington,
      advising him of the capture; to which we have received the inclosed answer, by which he
      requests the whole may be sent up to him, as the Army is in want of it, and he will be
      accountable for it. We also represent to you, that this Town is destitute of flour; that not a
      barrel is to be bought, at any rate, for the supply of the forts and inhabitants; and at best
      six hundred barrels should be reserved for their use, and to be sold for the cash only. Your
      advice is requested by us in respect to the disposal of this cargo, and we would wish it as
      speedily as possible, for our government. You will perceive, by General Washington's letter
      that an armament is fitting out at Boston, upon some expedition, and, as he suspects, to
      bombard some Towns on the Coast; we are not without great suspicion that the enemy have an
      intention upon this Town. With the advice of Captain Worthen, we have thought proper to order
      Captain <name>Robert Parker</name> to enlist forty-four men immediately, to be stationed at the fort on
      Seavy's Island, for the present defence of that fort for one month; which we hope will meet
      with your approbation, as we have been induced thereto wholly for the publick safety. We have
      appointed <name>John Penhallow</name>, <name>John Wendal</name> and <name>George King</name>, Esqs. to wait upon you, and to confer
      fully with you on such matters as may regard the general safety. I am, Gentlemen, in behalf of

   <P>The General fearing he shall give you &amp; the other Gentlemen of the Committee too much
      Trouble has directed me to inform you that he has dispatch'd Mr <name>Moylan Muster</name> Master General
      of the Army to negotiate the Transportation of the Flour, 2 he will give a Receipt for it, so
      that any Directions of the Congress with Regard to any Compensation for Capture may be fully
      complied with, should any such Claim be made. - The Vessel &amp;c. his Excelly thinks should
      remain under your Care till the Determination of Congress is had. -</P>
   <P>You will therefore Sir, oblige the General &amp; promote the Service by giving Mr Moylan all
      the Assistance you can. He has directed me to make his respectful Compliments to yourself and
      the other Gentlemen of the Committee -</P>
   <P>We have yet no farther Intelligence of the sailing of the Fleet mentioned in the General's
      Letter of the <gap/>. If there had been an Account at Boston of the Capture of this Vessel, we
      should have supposed an Attack upon you was meditated, but by a Deserter who came out
      yesterday we learn that this Event had not then reached Boston. - I am Sir, by Order of his

      Excellency Lord Dunmore in his letter to you of the 17th of July last has thought proper to
      charge me with Crimes of the most heinous nature, such as highly Concern my Honor, my Life and
      Property; in Consequence of which you were pleased to suspend me from the Command of His
      Majesty's Ship Mercury. His Lordship however in his letter to you of the 12th of September has
      thought proper to contradict the essential points of his accusations. </P>

      deeply Concerned, I am to beg that you will be pleased to order me home to England that I may
      at a publick Court Martial vindicate my Conduct in Virginia and support my honor and Character

   <P>Wednesday 4th Inst Brig. Gen. <name>Esek Hopkins</name> with about 300 [400] Troops marched on to Rhode
      Island &amp; came to Newport. Of these 150 were raised in Little Compton &amp; Tiverton in
      nine Hours. They were ordered by Dep. Gov. Cook to protect the Stock on this Island. They
      encamped at Mr Dudlys Mr Banisters &amp; Mr Irishs on the Hill about a Mile out of Town. Then
      marched &amp; drew up in order on the Parade. Two Tories Ned Cole &amp; <name>Ned Thurston</name> were
      apprehended &amp; bro't before the General in the Court House, tho' not by his Order. He bro't
      them out to the Head of the Battalion, &amp; declared he should not take up any of the
      Inhabitants of the Town, &amp; so dismissed them. But he would apprehend all the Men o' Wars
      Men &amp; Foreigners factors buying Things for [Thomas] Gage: accordg the Doctor of the Swan,
      &amp; a man detected in bringing round Goods from Boston &amp; selling them here, &amp;c were
      apprehended, brot before the General &amp; sent to Providence. The <name>Brenton Stock</name> was left on
      the Point, &amp; the Men o'War &amp; Transports drawn up close or near - but it being very
      rainy &amp; stormy on Thursday the Men o'War had not took off the Stock tho' they had set
      Marines to guard it. These resolute brave Men 280 of them marched down into the neck on
      Thursdy &amp; to the very extremity of it in the sight of the Men o' War &amp; very near,
      &amp; boldly bro't off 60 or 70 Head of Cattle, 100 Sheep, besides Hogs, Turkies &amp;c It was
      expected that there would be Firing from the Ships &amp; Landing Marines - but the Marines ran
      off - &amp; they fired only two swivels. Our Forces returned to Town, &amp; the Men o' War
      drew up close before the Town, &amp; swore in great Wrath that he would fire upon the Town at
      Vh P.M. But he did not. However his Threatngs threw the Town into a general Panic and the
      Inhabitants immedy went to removg their Effects with Women &amp; Children out of Town. The
      removing continued all Night, all Friday &amp; Saturday both day &amp; night. All Friday
      Wallace continued his Menaces, but fired not. On Saturday all the Ships and Transports sailed
      off to the northward towards Prudence or Bristol Ferry: but with what view is unknown.
      Additional Reinforcemts came in. &amp; it was reported that a Detatchmt from the Army at
      Cambridge was expected here to day: and some suppose Wallace is gone round to the No End of
      the Isld to prevent their passing the Ferry - others that he is gone to take Stock off of
      Prudence. The Army here may be near 500 strong. They instantly marched for the north End of
      the Isld. or Prudence to watch the Men o' War. </P>
   <P>An Express from Gov. Cook to Gen. Hopkins arrived this Morng bringing a Copy of a Letter from
      Gen. Washington, informing that a Detachmt of the Kings Troops with some ships of force lately
      sailed from Boston; doubtless to attack some Seaport, &amp; therefore he notified Gov. Cook.
      The Expecta of Regular Troops, &amp; also of Colony Troops, &amp; the Anticipation of a
      Conflagration of the Town in their Rencounters, renewed the spirit of Removal in which
      Multitudes have been employed with the greatest Assiduity. The Evacuation is incredible! The
      perhaps Three hundred Houses on the lsld (exclusive of 1100 in Newport) are all filled. The
      poor Tories cant remove. </P>

   <P>Agreeable to the order of the day the Congress resumed the consideration of the Resolution
      submitted by the Delegates of Rhode Island, 2 and</P>
   <P>Upon motion, Resolved, That the consideration of it be deferred till Monday 16 Inst</P>
   <P>The committee appointed to take into consideration the letter from the Convention of New York,
      respecting the fortifications ordered to be erected on Hudson's River, brought in their
      report, which being read, was agreed to, as follows:</P>
   <P>That the provincial Convention of New York be directed immediately to render Hudson's river
      defensible; That in doing this they may be particularly attentive to form such works as may be
      finished before the winter sets in. That it is very doubtful whether any stone work can be
      properly made at this advanced season, it is therefore submitted to the judgment of the
      convention, whether it could not be more cheaply and expeditiously done by works of wood or
      fassines. If they should think otherwise, that they be directed to go on with the work in the
      way which they think best, since it is the opinion of this Congress that the work should by no
      means be neglected.</P>
   <P>But if the work be already begun on the plan sent us, that they render such parts as can be
      first finished defensible, so that the labour be not thrown away, if an attack should be made
      before the whole can be finished.</P>
   <P>That the convention be directed to enquire whether there are not some other places where small
      batteries might be erected, so as to annoy the enemy on their passage, particularly, a few
      heavy cannon at or near Moore's house, and at a point on the west shore, a little above
      Verplank's point.</P>
   <P>That it be recommended to the said convention, to establish, at proper distances, posts to be
      ready to give intelligence to the country, in case of any invasion, or by signals to give
      alarms in case of danger, and that they confer with the Assembly of Connecticut, and
      Convention of New Jersey on the speediest manner of conveying intelligence in such cases, and
      receiving assistance when necessary. </P>
   <P>That the convention be farther directed to take the most effectual method to obstruct the
      navigation of the said river, if, upon examination, they find it practicable. 3 </P>
   <P>On motion made, </P>
   <P>Resolved, That orders be sent to General Wooster, in case he has no orders to the contrary
      from General Schuyler, that he immediately return to the batteries erecting in the highlands,
      and there leave as many of his troops, as the conductors of the works shall think will be
      necessary for compleating them, and that he repair with the remainder to New York. </P>
   <P>Resolved, that the Consideration of the resolve of Rhode Island be referred till next Monday
      week.4 </P>

   <P>2. <name>John Adams</name>, in his notes of debates in the Continental Congress, provides a lively account
      of the discussion upon the Rhode Island resolution, when its consideration was begun on
      October 7, as follows: </P>
   <P>Chase. It is the maddest Idea in the World, to think of building an American Fleet. Its
      Latitude is wonderful. we should mortgage the whole Continent. Reoollect the Intelligence on
      your Table - defend <name>N. York</name> - fortify upon Hudsons River. </P>
   <P>We should provide for gaining Intelligence - two swift sailing vessells.</P>
   <P>Hopkins. No Objection to putting off the Instructions from Rhode Island, provided it is to a
      future day.</P>
   <P>Paine. Seconds Chace's Motion, that it be put off to a future day Sine die.</P>
   <P>Chace. The Gentleman from Maryland never made such a Motion. I never use the Copulative. The
      Gentleman is very sarcastic, and thinks himself very sensible.</P>
   <P>Zubly. If the Plans of some gentlemen are to take Place, an American Fleet must be a Part of
      it - extravagant as it is.</P>
   <P>Deane. I wish it may be seriously debated. I dont think it romantic, at all.</P>
   <P><name>J. Rutledge</name>. Move that some Gent. be appointed to prepare a Plan and Estimate of an American
      Fleet.</P>
   <P>Zubly seconds the Motion.</P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Philadelphia, Octr. 7th, 1775</P>
   <P>If We must have Trade how shall We obtain it? Our Country furnishes a vast abundance of
      materials for Commerce. Foreign Nations have great Deamnds for them. If We should publish an
      Invitation to any one Nation or more, or to all Nations, to send their ships here and let our
      Merchants inform theirs that We have Harbours where the Vessells can lie in Safety, I
      conjecture that many private foreign Adventurers would find Ways to send Cargoes here thro all
      the Risques without Convoys. At the Same Time our own Merchants would venture out with their
      Vessells and Cargoes, especially in Winter, and would run thro many Dangers, and in both these
      Ways together, I should hope We might be supplied with Necessaries. </P>
   <P>All this however Supposes that We fortify and defend our own Harbours and Rivers. We may begin
      to do this. We may build Row Gallies, flatt bottomed Boats, floating Batteries, Whale Boats,
      <name>Vesseaux de Frize</name>, nay, Ships of War, how many, and how large I can't say. To talk of coping
      Suddenly with G.B. at sea would be Quixotism indeed, but the only Question with me is, can We
      defend our Harbours and Rivers? If We can We can trade. </P>

   <P>Williamsburg, October 7. 1</P>
   <P>Last week a vessel from the West Indies, with a cargo of rum, sugar, &amp;c. consigned to
      capt. Phripp of Norfolk, was seized by the ministerial pirates, and sent to Boston, for the
      use of their brethren in wickedness there; who now begin to stand in need of artificial
      spirits, to support their drooping courage.</P>
   <P>And on saturday [September 30] between 2 and 3 o'clock after noon, an officer with 12 or 13
      soldiers, and a few sailors, landed at the county wharw [sic wharf] in Norfolk, under cover of
      the men of war (who made every appearance of firing on the town, should the party be molested)
      and marched up the main street to mr. [<name>John Hunter</name>] Holt's printing-office, from whence,
      without the smallest opposition or resistance (although there were some hundred spectators)
      they deliberately carried off the types, and sundry other printing implements, with two of the
      workmen, and after getting to the water side with their booty gave three huzzas, in which they
      were joined by a crowd of negroes. A few spirited gentlemen in Norfolk, justly incensed at so
      flagrant a breach of good order and the constitution, and highly resenting the conduct of lord
      Dunmore and the navy gentry (who have now commenced downright pirates and banditti) ordered
      the drum to be beat to arrris, but were joined by few or none; so that it appears Norfolk is
      at present a very insecure place for the life or property of any individual, and is
      consequently deserted daily, by numbers of the inhabitants with their effects. </P>
   <P>We hear that lord Dunmore is exceedingly off ended with the Virginia printers, for presuming
      to furnish the publick with a faithful relation of occurrences, and now and then making a few
      strictures upn his lordship's own conduct, as well as that of some of his delightful
      associates, such as <name>Dicky Squire</name> and little white-headed Montague. Some of their actions have
      certainly deserved the severest reprehension, to say no worse; for which the printers appeal
      to the whole world, even <name>Fredy North</name> himself, and the immaculate <name>John Bute</name>. - It seems his
      lordship has it much at heart to destroy every channel of publick intelligence that is
      inimical to his designs upon the liberties of this country, alledging that they have poisoned
      the minds of the people, or, in other words, laid open to them the tyrannical designs of a
      weak and wicked ministry, which have been supported, in character, by most of their slavish
      dependents. It is to be hoped, however, that neither his lordship, nor any other person
      (however dignified) will have it in his power to succeed in so diabolical a scheme, only fit
      to be accomplished among Turks, and never could have been devised but by a person of the most
      unfriendly principles to the liberties of mankind. </P>
   <P>We hear that a Press is soon to be set up on board the ship which lord Dunmore lately seized
      from mess. Eilbeck, Ross, &amp; co. under his lordship's own immediate inspection, with proper
      assistants; so that we may soon expect to see the Gosport Chronicle, published by authority,
      which it is said is to contain occasionally, the commentaries of a certain illustrious chief's
      wars in Vandalia, some curious anecdotes, diverting stories, and a number of other valuable
      and interesting particulars, which no doubt will ensure to this new publication a very
      extensive circuit, and consequently redound to the credit and interest of its noble
      proprietor. </P>

   <P>The following extract of a letter from Norfolk 1 will serve to shew the distressed situation
      that town is unhappily reduced to by the wanton, unjust, and cruel behaviour of the tools of
      tyranny and oppression on board the ships of war in that harbour. Various reports have been in
      circulation here, within a few days past, of a manoeuvre of the soldiery on the 30th ult. and
      from the communication by water being obstructed, it is seldom we get intelligence from
      thence, but we are assured the letter contains an authentic account. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Notwithstanding the respect I have entertained for your private character, notwithstanding my
      repugnance to oppose to its merits your conduct in public and political transactions, during
      the present unnatural, unhappy and much to be lamented contest between Great Britain and her
      Colonies, which my long forbearance towards you must have evinced, you have reduced me to the
      necessity I wished to have avoided of choosing between the two disagreeable alternatives of
      testifying my disapprobation of your Conduct Officially, or taking upon myself the guilt of
      conniving at the undutifull behaviour of one of The King's Servants, which last being utterly
      inconsistent with my ideas of the duty I owe His Majesty, I cannot hesitate to make my
      election of the former however painfull my respect for Mr Johnston makes that decision. </P>
   <P>I have seen with astonishment Your late appearance in the conspicuous character of Moderator
      of a popular Assembly unknown to the laws and constitution of this Province and summoned and
      convened by yourself. and I have seen with greater surprise if possible your acceptance of the
      appointment of Treasurer of the Northern District of this Colony, unconstitutionally, and
      contrary to all law and usage conferred upon you by this body of your own creation, on whose
      other acts so derogatory to the just authority of The King and so utterly subversive of the
      constitution of this Country I shall not here enlarge, although I do most sincerely and
      unceasingly deplore them. Your conduct in these instances Sir I am bound to consider such
      manifestations of your undutifulness to His Majesty and His Government, and such an avowal of
      your participation in the present fatal disorders of this Country as render it altogether
      unfit, and inconsistent with my duty to The King to permit you to continue Deputy Naval
      Officer of this Province: and I am to inform you that I have accordingly appointed Mr
      <name>Archibald Neilson</name> to supersede you as Deputy Naval Officer of this Colony, from which Office
      you are hereby suspended until His Majestys Royal Pleasure shall be known. I am Sir &amp;c. </P>

      Letter from Capt. Tollemache Commander of his majesty's <name>Sloop Scorpion</name> 2 to Richard Fowle

   <P>Resolved that in the Debates of this Committee one Person only shall speak at a Time and no
      Interruptions permitted. </P>
   <P><name><name>Henry Tucker</name> Esquire</name> of Portrayal was chosen Chairman. </P>
   <P>The Letter from Capt Tollemache dated Septr 30th 1775 was then produced and read.</P>
   <P>Then <name><name>Henry Tucker</name> Esquire</name> of Somerset produced Instructions from the Parish of Somerset in
      what manner the Said Letter should be answered </P>
   <P>Then <name><name>Henry Tucker</name> Esquire</name> of Portrayal informed the Committee that the Instructions received
      from the Parish of Port royal were generally to set forth the Facts relative to the Subject of
      Capt. Tollemache's Letter, and to join in an address to the Governor to call the Assembly
      immediately. </P>
   <P>Mr. <name>Robert Tucker</name> one of the Committee of Inspection for Somerset Parish appointed in
      obedience to the Vote of the Governor's Council &amp; Assembly for the due Observation &amp;
      inforcing of the Provision Act was called upon to declare what passed on board Capt. Conyers's
      Schooner on Fryday the 29th of Septr last who gave the Committee the following Information
      Viz: </P>
   <P><name>Henry Tucker</name> of Somerset informed the Committee that Information was received on Thursday Evg
      the 28th of Septr that a Shallop with armed Men had left St Georges that afternoon and was
      designed for Elis Harbour Where the[y] errived Some Time after Night 3 - The Circumstance of
      her coming at so unseasonable an Hour &amp; in a hostile Manner generally alarmed the people
      &amp; induced them to think that some improper Design was had against the Persons or Property
      of the People, particularly as Reports had circulated for many Days before that the Scorpion
      came to Ber[mud]a for the express Purpose of impressing Men from these Ilds - The People
      generally armed and prepared to oppose any illegal &amp; arbitrary Attack and for no other
      Purpose whatever - In Order to reduce the Matter to a Certainty himself with Mr Jennings and
      Mr. <name>G. Tucker</name> were desired by the People to call on the Officers who were said to have the
      Direction of the Shallop &amp; desire to be acquainted with the Purport of their coming at
      that unseasonable Hour &amp; in a hostile Manner in appearance to Disturb the Peace of the
      People - That the officers expressed a Concern at the People havg taken the Alarm at the
      Manner of their coming in which they must own gave some Foundation for such Alarm, that they
      shou'd have been glad to have been applied to imedeately on their landing when they shou'd
      readily have given every Satisfaction in their Power to have composed the minds of the People
      that they then declaved that they came with no Design of molesting any of the Inhabitants but
      for the sole Purpose of endeavouring to purchase the Cargo of the Schooner from So Car[olin]a
      comanded by <name>Capt Conyers</name>, that they had been at Capt Conyer's Ild for that Purpose but cou'd
      not see him as he was from Home. - They were then told that if any Person here had Power to
      Dispose of the Cargo it was one Mr Cole who was Passenger on bd the Schooner &amp; the Place
      where he was to be met with - The Officers said they shou'd call on Mr Cole in the Morning for
      that Purpose - that the People were then satisfied with the Declarations of the Officers &amp;
      imediately dispersed - that the Officers behaved with great Civility &amp; Politeness &amp;
      were thoroughly treated in the Same Manner themselves -</P>
   <P>The above Information was confirmed by Messrs. <name>John Jennings</name> &amp; <name>Daniel Tucker</name>. </P>
   <P>Capt. <name>Clement Conyers</name> Senior part owner of the Schooner from Carolina next informed the
      Committee that on the morning of Fryday the 29th Ultimo, the Officers and Sailors from on
      board the Scorpion came on board his Schooner and asked for Mr. Cole who coming on board
      immediately the Officers applied to him to purchase his Cargoe of Rice. Who replied that he
      could not sell it - as it belonged to persons in St Christophers who for aught he knew might
      be starving for want of it. The officer then said if he could not purchase it [illegible] he
      was commissioned by the Governor to take the Vessel and Cargo and carry them to Town - He then
      asked if there was any Owner of the Vessel, and was informed that himself (viz This Informant)
      was part owner thereof. The Officer then said he must take the Vessel to Town - This Informant
      replied that she should not be removed without his having good Security for her. - This
      Informant then came off and met Mr R: T: with some others going on board the Vessel &amp;
      knows nothing further of the Transaction. </P>
   <P>Mr Cole of Carolina a passenger onboard <name>Capt Conyers</name>'s Schooner was next called upon who gave
      the following Information - Viz: That on Fryday the 29th Ultimo the officer from Scorpion came
      on board the Schooner and demanded of him if he would dispose of the Cargoe on board the
      Schooner - He replied that he could not do it as it belonged to persons in St Christophers who
      might be starving for want of it for aught he knew. - The officer said he would pay him his
      own price for the Rice in Bills or Cash. Upon his refusing to dispose of the Cargoe the
      officer said he would seize it &amp; carry it to Town by Force; and then ordered the Hatches
      to be shut and demanded the Sails - He also desired that the Rice which had been unladed
      should be put on board again. This Informant represented to them that Vessel being very leaky
      was unfit to go to Town with the Rice and desired that they would permit him to continue to
      unload. Soon After Mr <name>Robert Tucker</name> &amp; Mr <name>Daniel Hinson</name> with Mr <name>Josiah Young</name> came on board,
      and asked what was the Matter. This Informant told them the Gentleman (Officers) came on board
      to prevent his unloading the Vessel &amp; wanted to carry her with her Cargoe to Town - The
      Gentlemen from on shore replied that it should not be done as it was contrary to the Law of
      the Island; for if they wanted Provisions to carry off the Island the Legislature must be
      consulted, or words to that Effect. Some other Conversation of no Consequence past soon after
      which The Officers went off saying they would bring the whole Force of the Scorpion to take
      the Rice. </P>
   <P>Capt <name>Clement Conyers</name> Junr being next called upon in substance confirmed the Information of Mr
      Cole. With this addition that when the Officer ordered the Hatches to be shut he asked him
      whether he had taken the Charge of the Vessel on himself as in that Case she was in his power,
      - but represented that her being carryed out of the Harbour might be attended with bad Effects
      - The officer replied he wanted to have her Out - The Officer then told him he should have two
      Men on board to prevent any more Rice being Taken off. Which he replied he did not think he
      had any right to do, as he had made a legal Report and had a permit to land his Cargoe from
      the Ca: Ho: [Castle Harbor]. </P>
   <P>Mr <name>Samuel Gutesbury</name> next called upon confirmed in substance The Information of Capt: Clement
      Conyers Junior with whom he came off the Schooner - With this addition That the Officer when
      he said he must seize the Vessel &amp; Cargoe; said That he should do it by order of the
      Governor for the Service of Government. </P>
   <P>Mr <name>Robert Tucker</name> report[ed] That in the Morning observing that the Shallop that came up with
      the Officer &amp;c the preceeding Evening had gone on board the Schooner he conceiving it to
      be his Duty to go on board requested Mr <name>Daniel Hinson</name> &amp; Mr <name>Josiah Young</name> to accompany him.
      Upon coming on board he saw the Officers walking on the Quarter Deck talking with each other -
      Upon seeing only two or three Casks of Rice landed he conceived that <name>Capt Conyers</name> had met with
      some Obstruction in doing it. He then asked the Reason of his not unloading as he understood
      he intended to take his Cargoe out. Capt. Conyers replied that the Officers had ordered the
      Hatches to be laid &amp; barred and the Tackles to be hooked up - He then replied that this
      was quite contrary to their Declaration of the Night before, That they had no Intention of
      offering any Molestation to any person in any respect whatever - That he looked upon it as
      unwarrantable &amp; quite contrary to <name>Law of the Country</name> and that he would (if in Capt
      Conyer's place) order The Hatches to be unlaid &amp; the Cargoe to be taken out. Lieut: Drew 4
      immediately interfered whereupon this Informant asked him his Authority. He replied he had
      orders to buy the Cargoe, and if he could not buy it to seize it, and had seized it for
      Government. This Informant then asked him whether the Vessel was not legally entered. He
      replied - Yes - This Informant then insisted that it was illegal to obstruct the landing of
      the Cargoe after such Entry - Mr Whitworth 5 then asked why the Governmt. had not a right to
      seize Provisions when-ever they wanted it - This Informant then replied that those Provisions
      were detained by the Authority of an Act of the Legislature of the Island. - Lieut Drew still
      insisted that they had a Right to it &amp; that they would carry the Vessel and Cargoe to
      Town. He answered that he should not have it for that the Inhabitants would never consent for
      The Rice to be taken away illegally. He then informed Lieut. Drew of the Occasion of making
      the Provision Act by which no Provisions could be exported without the Consent of the
      Legislative Body for that Purpose - That no person in the Island would refuse Provisions for
      the Ship's Use but that Agreeably to the Provision Act under the Authority of which he then
      acted they could not export any Provisions whatever except salt Provisions - Lieut.-Drew then
      said they wanted the Rice and they must have it - to which This Informant answered they should
      not without the Consent of the People - and upon seeing Mr <name>Daniel Hinson</name> going off the Vessel
      he called to him to make Haste and bring Assistance which he thought it his Duty to call for
      to prevent the Rice being carried away. Mr Whitworth expressed him-self sensible of the
      politeness he had been treated with the Evening before &amp; went off Soon after without any
      Interruption 6 telling Mr Cole They might open their Hatches &amp; go to work and observing
      that he hoped the people would think better of it, or else the Scorpion would make use of all
      her Force to obtain the Provisions. To which this Informant replied that without the Consent
      of the Legislature two or three Scorpions would not do. </P>
   <P>Mr <name>Josiah Young</name> in Substance confirmed the Information of Mr Tucker.</P>
   <P>A Letter to Capt Tollemache was voted - read and approved by a Majority. -</P>
   <P>An address to the Govr to convene the general Assembly was also read and approved of. </P>
   <P>Resolved - that it be an Instruction to the Committee appointed to join a Committee from
      Somerset Parish to answer the Letter from the Honourable Capt Tollemache, that they declare
      the strictest Allegiance to his Majesty's Government, and set forth that his Majestys subjects
      of these Islands have on all Occasions demeaned themselves as loyal faithful and liege
      Subjects of his present most gracious Majesty and his Predecessors, and that they have ever
      paid all due obedience to the Laws of the British Empire - That as Subjects thereof they are
      entitled to all the Rights Privileges and Immunitites which are claimed under the British
      Constitution. That the Right of personal Security and of personal Property are the inherent
      indefeasable Rights of every Englishman, which cannot be infringed without a manifest
      Violation of the first Principles of the Constitution. That the Inhabitants of these Islands
      being fully represented in the general Assembly are bound by all Laws enacted by the
      Legislature of this Island, which are not repugnant to the Laws of the Realm of Great Britain
      in as full and ample Manner as the subjects of his Majesty residing in Gr: Br: are by the Acts
      of the British Parliament. - That any attempt to invalidate or contravene the Authority of any
      Act of the Legislature of these Islands by any person or persons whatsoever within the
      Jurisdiction of the same, tends to stir up Seditions and Tumults among his Majesty's liege
      Subjects, and is pregnant of the most calamitous Events to the Community. That it is the Duty
      of all Magistrates and Officers within these Islands to exert themselves to prevent any
      Violation of the Acts of the Legislature thereof, and that it is the indispensable Duty of
      every Individual within the same to obey such orders &amp; Directions as the said Magistrates
      &amp; Officers shall give in order to preserve the Laws of this Country sacred and inviolate -
      That an Attempt made on Fryday last by certain Officers and other persons under their Command
      belonging to his Majestys <name>Sloop Scorpion</name> commanded by the honorable Capt Tollemache to seize a
      Cargoe of Rice against the Consent of the person lntrusted with the Management and Disposal
      thereof, without any legal Authority whatsoever, was totally repugnant to the Rights of
      personal Property, and that the said Attempt being probably made with an Intention of
      exporting Provisions contrary to an Express Act of the Legislature of this Island is a most
      flagrant Violation of the Rights of the people &amp; of the legislative Body of these Islands,
      That it was therefore (as well as in Obedience to a Vote of the Governor Council &amp;
      Assembly of these expressly passed for the preservation of the Act for the preventing the
      Exportation of Provisions) the bounden &amp; indispensable Duty of all Magistrates and
      officers and other Inhabitants of these Islands to oppose the Execution of any Attempt by
      which the Security of the Lives and Properties of the good People of Bermuda may be

   <P>Intelligence given me, by Captain <name><name>Francis Grant</name> Gordon</name> of His Majesty's Ship Argo Vizt 7h
      October 1775 </P>
   <P>During the time I stopped in St Pierres Bay, Martinique, to take up the Pomonas anchors and
      Cables Information was given me; that a Sloop belonging to Englishmen was then taking in
      Powder and other Warlike Stores, the Lieutenant went to examine her, and found an Englishman,
      who he supposed to be the Master, and four other Englishmen weighing the anchor, on his
      entrance a boat was sent for the Master but no one knew his name, they all seemed confused,
      and being asked for Pen and Ink to take the Sloops Name, the Man supposed to be the Master,
      said the Vessel was called the Betsey, that he came Mate of her from America, but that a new
      Master was appointed, whose Name he did not know, but believed it was something like Francois,
      he could not tell where she belonged to or where bound when a Frenchman came on board, said he
      was the Master, and flew into a violent passion for the Sloop being boarded, as he said she
      was a French Vessel (tho' no Insult was offered to any on board) and produced a Receipt in
      English, for a Vessel called the William and James of an old Date but refused shewing any
      other Papers relating to the Sloop, on which a Mate and two Men were left on board, with
      Orders not to meddle with any thing til the Lieutenant returned, who was sent to take the Men
      out of the Sloop and wait on the Govrenor of Port St Piere on the Island of Martinique to
      acquaint him with the particular circumstances that had happened and desire his permission to
      seize the Sloop, as she was taking in Powder and Arms for the Rebels in America, but the
      Governor refused hearing the Lieutenant, and said he would sell the Americans Powder, Arms, or
      any thing else they wanted, under the nose of any Englishman of War and desired the Argo would
      leave the Port immediately, and if any Englishman of War ever dared to board any Ship in that
      Port whether English or not, he would order the Forts to fire at, and sink them if possible. 2 </P>
   <P><name>Benjamin Brown Master of the Edward</name>, another American Sloop then in St Pierres Bay (laughing)

   <P>Captain [Oliver] Porter was then there [Pamlico river], and loading for the West Indies. Being
      anxious lest I could not get an opportunity of getting away, I left Mr. [Thomas] Jones' before
      I was sufficiently able to work, and went on board the sloop [Two Sisters]. . . . </P>
   <P>We arrived at Martinique in fourteen days, where the committee of <name>N. Carolina</name> sent for powder
      and ball. While we lay here, we were obliged to observe the law which required us to have a
      French Captain on board. An English Frigate lay near, who sent her barge and Lieutenant on
      board to make prize of the sloop. The Lieutenant ordered the anchor up to tow her alongside
      the Frigate. Our French Captain drove him forward with a handspike, and would have knocked out
      his brains, had he not retreated. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>By His Brittannick Majesty's Ship Argo, which arrived here this day from Martinique, where I
      had sent her, for the Pomona's Anchors and Cables; left behind in the late Gale of Wind I am
      sorry to receive the information she brings me, that a most pernicious Trade is now carried on
      from thence; in order to supply Gunpowder and Warlike Stores, to the Rebellious Subjects of
      the King my Master, in America: By American Vessels, having a French Master put on board them;
      hoping by that means to secure them from being seized: however should any of our Ships of War
      meet the said Vessels at Sea your Excellency must know the nominal French Master cannot answer
      that purpose; as by the Law of nations, all such Commodities are contraband when carrying to
      nations at War, by any neutral power: and surely there is much greater reason they should be
      deemed so, when intended to supply the Rebellious Subjects of a friend an Ally. </P>
   <P>I do not directly approve of Captain [<name>Francis Grant</name>] Gordons searching any of the Vessels in
      His most Christian Majestys Port of Martinique; but on his receiving such information as he
      did: Zeal for his Masters Service, might hurry a good Officer to do, what on cooler thoughts
      he would not: to the same cause I therefore attribute the impolite answer the Commandant at
      Martinique sent to Captain Gordon on his representing the Case to him and asking his
      permission to seize the Vessel. </P>
   <P>I beg your Excellency will believe I shall always make it my Study to keep up and Cultivate,
      the good harmony and Friendship, that I hope still subsists between our respective Nations and
      I have no doubt, your Excellency entertains the same friendly sentiments towards the
      accomplishment of which I flatter myself you will immediately put a stop to a trade so very
      pernicious and disgraceful. </P>
   <P>Should any of his Britannick Majesty's Ships under my Command chance to meet at Sea any of the
      above described American Vessels (having Powder and Warlike Stores on board) they have my
      Express orders, forthwith to seize them; notwithstanding a French Nominal Master, may be on
      board the said Vessel, and call her his property. </P>
   <P>Captain Gordon of the Argo will deliver this Letter and give any further information you may
      think necessary. I have the honor to be &amp;[c]</P>

      laden with Soldiers, Arms, Ammunition or Provissions for or from Said Army or which you shall
      have good Reason to suspect are in such Service.</P>
   <P>3. If you should be so Successful as to take any of said Vessels you are immediately to send

   <P>7. You are particularly charged to avoid any Engagement with any armed Vessel of the Enemy,
      tho' you may be equal in strength or may have some small Advantage; the Design of this
      Enterprise being to intercept the Supplies of the Enemy which will be defeated by your running
      into unnecessary Engagements.</P>
   <P>8. As there may be other Vessels employed in the same Service with yourselves you are to fix
      upon proper Signals &amp; your Stations being settled so as to take the greatest Range avoid
      cruizing on the same Ground - if you should happen to take Prizes in Sight of each other the
      Rules which take Place among private Ships of War are to be observed in the Distribution of
      the prize Money.</P>
   <P>9. In Case of retaking the Vessel of any Friend to the American Cause - I will recommend it to

      Vessels are not to be deemed as coming within the Directions respecting other Vessels.</P>
   <P>10. You are to be extremely careful and frugal of your Ammunition - by no means to waste any
      of it in Salutes or for any Purpose but what is absolutely necessary. 3 </P>

   <P>You are to observe that no Bills will be allowed for work done to his Majesty's Ship under
      your command between one refitting and another, unless some unavoidable accident, or the
      Service you are employed on, make the same absolutely necessary, in which case you are always
      to cause it to be done, with as much frugality as possible, to take proper Vouchers and draw
      Bills for the Same as directed by the General printed instructions; but you are never to make
      any alterations in your Ship without my order, unless it be for her immediate preservation, or
      'tis obviously necessary for the Security or defence of the Crew during the present Rebellion
      and in that case to acquaint me therewith if any Expence is thereby incurr'd to the Crown. </P>
   <P>11th </P>
   <P>The Commissioners of his Majestys Navy having represented to my Lords Commissioners of the
      Admiralty that the expence of Cordage and Stores of all Sorts even at the Kings Yards abroad,
      appear to them to be very great, that they cannot help entertaining an opinion that there is
      carelessness in the use, and Management of them, and that Rigging is often condemned when it
      might last much longer, especially when they observe by the Journals delivered into their
      office, how very little some of the Stationed Ships appear to have been at sea; You are hereby
      Strictly charged to be very careful in the Management, and to use the utmost good Husbandry in
      the Expenditure of your Cordage, Rigging and other Stores, and to take care that none be
      condemned but when there shall be an absolute necessity for it. </P>
   <P>12th </P>
   <P>And Whereas it is highly necessary that you should be always as much as possible upon your
      Guard to prevent desertion you are never to suffer a Boat to go on shore from the Ship under
      your command witht [without] a petty officer in her, and whenever an officer goes on Shore
      upon Service, or his pleasure, the Same Caution is to be observed, and no Boat is to be kept
      waiting on any account, but as soon as the officer's appointed time, which he is to be
      enjoined to be very exact in keeping. 13th </P>
   <P>And Whereas the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, have Signified that the Case relative to
      the importation of Bullion into his Majestys Colonies in North America in foreign Bottoms has
      been refered to the Attorney and Solicitor Generals, and that they have Given their opinion
      that by the true Construction of the 12th Charles the second; Ch. 18 and 7th and 8th of King
      William the third Bullion may be imported into the Plantations in foreign Bottoms, You are
      hereby required and directed not to Seize, or molest foreign Vessels bringing Bullion to any
      part of his Majesty's Dominion in North America, in like manner as has been heretofore used,
      but you are to convey them to Boston or to any port in possession of his Majesty's forces, and
      where the property may not fall into the hands of the Rebels untill my directions can be
      obtained concerning them. </P>
   <P>14th </P>
   <P>Whereas a New Settlement is forming and a Town building by his Majestys Subjects on Amelia
      Island on the Coast of East Florida, near the entrance of St Mary's River, You are hereby
      required in case you shall be stationed at [New] Providence and the Bahama Islands, to repair
      occasionally to the before mentioned Island, as the other Services on which you are employed
      will admit, and to give the Settlers there any protection and assistance they may stand in
      need of. </P>
   <P>15th </P>
   <P>And Whereas the King has thought fit to direct that a small part of his Forces stationed at St
      Augustine not exceeding Two Companies, shall do duty in the Forts of the Bahama Islands; You
      ar~ hereby required and directed upon application from the commander in chief of his Majesty's
      Forces in North America for the time being to provide a passage for the said Forces and their
      Baggage on board the Ship you command to and from the said places as occasion may require,
      unless the Same should interfere with some other very essential Service, on which you may
      happen to be employed, at the time when the application is made in which case their
      transportation must be postppned 'till such very essential service shall be performed. </P>
   <P>16th </P>
   <P>Whereas it has been represented by Lord <name>William Campbell</name> late Governor of <name>Nova Scotia</name>, that
      the Revenue officers at Halifax have cause to suspect that an unfair use has sometimes been
      made of the Clause inserted in an Act of that Province: Whereby it is ordered that all Rum and
      other Spirits issued for the use of his Majesty's Ships, by the Contractors should be exempted
      from the Payment of the whole of the excise duties under certain Regulations, particularly
      that no part of what was shipped should be relanded, or sold within the Jurisdiction of that
      Province, In order therefore to prevent such abuse in future, you are hereby required and
      directed not to give any Certificate for Rum, or other Spirits received on board his Majesty's
      [ship] under your command when at Halifax, except for such Rum, or Spirits as shall be
      furnished by the Contractor of the Victualling or his Agent for the time being and the
      Quantity to be first certified from him to you before you sign any Certificate. </P>
   <P>17th </P>
   <P>The Commissioners of his Majesty's Navy have Signified to me that Men sent home from foreign
      Stations as Invalids having only written Certificates from the Surgeons of the Hospitals,
      which are not accompanied by the Ships Sick Ticket, whereby the public is put to great expense
      by their long continuance in the Hospitals in England before they can receive their wages, you
      are hereby required and directed in order to prevent invalids being sent home in this
      irregular manner in future to take particular care when any men are Discharged from his
      Majesty's Ship under your command unserviceable, that you transmit the proper pay Ticket and
      Certificate as directed by the Late Act of Parliament, to the Commissioners of his Majesty's
      Navy, and you are also directed when any Men belonging to his Majesty's Ship under your
      command are sent to the Hospital for cure in any part of the Continent, to send a duplicate
      Ticket properly filled up arid Signed with them. </P>
   <P>18th </P>
   <P>You are further required and directed to cause your Purser to pay with Money for all such
      water as may from time to time be wanted for the use of His Majesty's Ship under your command;
      their Lordships having directed the Victualling Board to allow him on the passing his Accounts
      for all the Water he may so purchase, upon the Vouchers being approved by the commander in
      chief, and not otherwise, at the same time, I shall not allow of the Water being charged which
      you may use in brewing of Spruce Beer for the use of the Ship. </P>
   <P>19th </P>
   <P>And whereas the due performance of the Services aforementioned will depend in a Great Measure
      upon the Ship you command being at Sea as much as possible, you are to keep your Ship and
      Boats in constant readiness to attend such Service, and when Cruizing you are not to go into
      Port unnecessarily, nor to remain there longer than your wants, and necessaties or the public
      Service which may occasion your going thither, shall unavoidably require. </P>
   <P>20th </P>
   <P>You are to correspond with me at Boston &amp; transmit to me by all opportunities an account
      of your proceedings, with the State and Condition of his Majesty's Ship under your command,
      together with such other accounts and Intelligence as you may judge necessary, to make me
      acquainted with and you are likewise to acknowledge in writing the receipt of all Letters, and
      Orders you may at any time receive from me on his Majesty's Service, mentioning the Date and
      purport thereof, and time of Receiving. </P>

      Vessel of any then at Boston and none other being so ready and in all respects so proper for
      this sudden Service, to put to Sea immediately in quest of the Rebels but to return in eight
      days to Nantasket, for according to her former destination she was to have sailed in two or

   <P>Dear General</P>

   <P>This Evening I have been favored with Yours by Colonel [James] Clinton, Every Reinforcement is
      welcome, but I expected more Men in 14 Batteaus, I find My Numbers but little encreased as I
      seldom see any of those Return I send to Tionderoga - The two Barrels of Sugar turn out two
      Barrels of Flour - We now have here and at the Isle au Noix 300 Barrels of Pork and 328
      Barrels of Flour, so that I think You may venture to send more Men than Provisions - The
      Season advances fast &amp; we shall have a heavy Piece of Work to get our Cannon to the
      Westward, where we must have a strong Post, as it is at a Distance from Support &amp; near the
      Enemy. -</P>
   <P>Our Conference with <name>St Luke</name> [la Corne] has ended in Smoke - He made the Indian deliver my
      Letter to Carleton who had it burnt without reading It. - the Indian told the Governor very
      honestly that he was sent to me by <name>St Luke</name> &amp; Others - The Indians of Caghanawaga attended
      at La Prairie according to Appointment &amp; are much displeased at the Trick put upon them by
      those Gentlemen - they seem to think <name>St Luke</name> was discovered in his Plan &amp; dared not
      venture to carry it thro; - I hope We shall have more Powder! </P>
   <P>The Enemy are exceedingly uneasy at the Post on the East Side &amp; have made two ineffectual
      &amp; indeed feeble Efforts to dislodge the Canadians. - The Battery there is not finished,
      they don't love work. </P>
   <P>I have been obliged to send them Assistance. </P>
   <P>The very high Prices which Officers must pay here for every Thing brought from Tionderoga, are
      far above what their Scanty Pittance of Pay will allow of - I must request You will represent
      the peculiar Hardship of their Situation, which displaces them entirely from the Footing of
      the Troops, employed among their Friends in the Midst of a Plentiful Country - if their Pay
      can't be augmented a Gratuity may be made to them adequate to the Difficulties they labour
      under. It might extend to Subalterns and Captains - perhaps it may not be so absolutely
      necessary to go any higher up - &amp; Indeed the Detachment in the Country &amp; on the North
      Side live very well &amp; by what I can find, Cheap. - &amp; I am afraid I shall have a
      disagreeable Reckoning with some of them, concerning the Public Money. -</P>
   <P>I send a considerable Corps of sick; Little Mischief since my last, one or two wounded.</P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Salem 9th October 1775</P>
   <P>We were too sanguine in our expectation[s] on saturday, which occasiond Mr Moylan to tell Mr
      Reed, that one of the Schooners would be ready for the sea on thursday next it is difficult to
      procure Carpenters to put them in the necessary order, we therefore think it win be saturday
      before the first will be ready to sail, on that day we wou'd recommend to your Excellency to
      order the Captain &amp; his Company to set off - on the Wednesday ensuing we have no doubt,
      but that the other vessel will be properly fitted. </P>
   <P>there has some difficultys occurd in. the hire of these vessells, relative to the Manner in
      which they shoud be found. it is Customary for them to have but three sails, Mainsail
      foresail, &amp; gib, these are sufficient for the Voyages they usually Make, the Owners justly
      remark, that were they to purchass the other sails Necessary for the present purpose, the hire
      of the vessells would be inadequate to the expence there are many objections made of a Smaller
      nature which we had no other. method of Compromiseing than, agreeing, that on their part, they
      shall put their vessells in the same good order &amp; Condition which they would be obliged to
      do, were they hired to take in a Cargo for the West indies or elsewhere, &amp; on ours, that
      what extra expence may accrue from the nature of their present employment, must be a publick
      Charge</P>
   <P>Colonel Glover has given the strongest proofs of his good oppinion of the Schooner commanded
      by Captain [Nicholson] Broughton, he has ventured his brother &amp; his favourite son on board
      of her, 2 however Lest any blame may lay with him, if any Misfortune shoud happen (which God
      avert) he will be pleasd to have the Captain &amp; his Company removd to a vessell of better
      fame for Sailing, 3 we have for this purpose hired a schooner from Mr [Thomas] Stevens of
      Marblehead, She is noted for her good qualitys, &amp; will be ready to take in the Hannahs
      Company &amp; Stores in 12 or 14 days the extra Sails &amp;c on board the Later will serve for
      her, she is taken up on the same terms with the other two, 4/p ton month or 5/4 Lawful
      money.</P>
   <P>Your Excellency may be assured we have used our best diligence in transacting this business,
      which we will Continue to do in fitting them out appointing Agents, &amp; in every Command you
      may please to honor us with - We the the honour[&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>P.S. Yesterday afternoon about five o'Clock were seen comeing out of Boston Harbour, &amp;
      this morning about six o'Clock off of Marblehead, two Large ships of War, a Schooner &amp; a
      sloop, Steering a N.N.E. course, it is apprehended they are goeing to Portsmouth. Mr Moylan
      will Set out for that place to morrow </P>

      the son, <name>John Glover</name>, Jr., her first lieutenant.</P>
   <P>3. Although the Hannah was to be replaced, she remained in Continental pay for some time after
      October 10, when she was driven ashore in Beverly Cove. Colonel <name>John Glover</name>'s Colony Ledger,

      the Hannah was hired by Washington around August 15, her final discharge would have been about

   <P>My attention is directed to the fitting out of privateers, which I hope will make them swarm
      here. Is it not time to encourage individuals to exert themselves this way? General [Thomas]
      Gage before the commencement of hostilities destroyed or confiscated the provisions then
      collecting for the army, and can we hesitate at this time about the propriety of confiscating
      vessels employed by him to infest the coasts, or supply his troops, or can we doubt the
      propriety of encouraging individuals by giving them the advantage resulting from their
      reprisals, when it is certain that other plans will not meet with such success as will
      probably attend this?</P>
   <P>If the continent should fit out a heavy ship or two, and increase them as circumstances shall
      admit, the colonies large privateers, and individuals small ones, surely we may soon expect to
      see the coast clear of cutters. </P>

   <P>JOURNAL OF THE MASSACHUSETTS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 1</P>
   <P>[Watertown] Monday, October 9, 1775</P>
   <P>Mr. Sullivan, according to Order, reported the following, which was read, and accepted,
      viz.</P>
   <P>May it please your Honors:</P>
   <P>The House has just received Intelligence that there are now at Long Island, near Penobscot
      River, several Persons employed in cutting Wood, in order to supply our Enemies, the
      Ministerial Army, now in Possession of the Town of Boston; and that Admiral [Samuel] Greaves
      has sent a Number of armed Vessels to guard and protect the Providers and Carriers of said
      Wood. And as the Militia, with the Forces raised in this Colony to defend the Sea Coast are
      under the Command of your Honors, the House begs Leave to suggest to you the Necessity of your
      taking this Matter under Consideration; that your Honors may order such Reinforcements as you
      shall judge necessary. And the House further begs Leave to suggest that one Captain [David]
      Bradish, now in the Army, can give your Honors information of the above Facts.</P>
   <P>Ordered, That Mr. Sullivan, Col. Orne, Mr. Pitts, Col. Sawyer, and Mr. Mills, be a Committee
      to wait upon the Majority of the honorable Council with the foregoing Message. [Endorsed] In
      Council, October 9, 1775; Read and by the major part of the Council, Ordered, That William
      Sever, <name>Walter Spooner</name>, and <name>Moses Gill</name>, Esqs., be a Committee to consider the merits thereof,
      and report. </P>
   <P>Afternoon. </P>
   <P>The Report of the Committee appointed to consider the Expediency of fitting out armed Vessels
      was taken into Consideration. Read. and accepted. </P>
   <P>Whereas the the unnatural Enemies of these Colonies have infested the Sea Coasts with armed
      Vessels, and are daily endeavouring to distress the Inhabitants, by plundering Live Stock, and
      making Captures of Provision and other Vessels, being the Property of said Inhabitants: And
      whereas the Grand Congress of America have resolved, &quot;That each Colony at their own
      Expence, make such Provision by armed Vessels or otherwise, as their respective Assemblies,
      Conventions, or Committees of Safety shall judge expedient, and suitable to their
      Circumstances and Situations, for the Protection of their Harbours and Navigation on the
      Sea-Coasts, against all unlawful Invasions, Attacks and Depredations, from Cutters and Ships
      of War:&quot; And whereas it is the Duty and Interest of each Colony to exert itself as well
      for the Purpose of keeping Supplies from the Enemy, as for those mentioned in the Resolve just
      recited. </P>
   <P>Therefore, Resolved, That a Committee be now appointed to prepare and bring in a Bill for the
      Confiscation of all armed and other Vessels, that shall be taken and brought into this Colony,
      together with their Cargoes, Appurtenances, &amp;c. which shall have been found making
      unlawful Invasions, Attacks or Depredations on our Sea Coasts or Navigation, or improved in
      supplying the Enemy with Provisions, &amp;c. or employed by them in any other Respect
      whatever. - And that Provision be made in said Bill for encouraging such of the Inhabitants of
      this Colony, as shall for this Purpose be recommended by the Committees of Correspondence and
      Safety of the Town in which they shall dwell, to fit our armed Vessels under such Regulations
      as the General Court shall order; and that all Vessels and Cargoes that shall be taken by said
      Inhabitants or others, properly authorized to take the same, and that shall be legally
      condemned in this Colony, shall be the Property of the Captors, they paying the Charges of
      Condemnation. Also, that further Provision be made in said Bill for determining the Salvage
      that shall be allowed on such Vessels as shall be retaken from the Enemy before Condemnation;
      and for erecting a Court for the Trial and Condemnation of all Vessels, Cargoes, &amp;c. as
      aforesaid, that shall be taken and brought into this Colony. </P>

   <P>Sir.</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 9 October 1775.</P>
   <P>A small Sloop from Bermuda anchored here the 28, and I received by the hands of a trusty
      Negroe a Letter from Governor [George] Bruere. I enclose a Copy of it 2</P>
   <P>You may perceive that the Rebels of the Continent are indefatigable in spreading their poison,
      and that even Bermudas and the Bahama Islands abound with men under their influence, who
      though liable to be crushed with a single Blow are yet daring enough to be guilty of Robbery
      and Rebellion. Governor Bruere does not mention it, but I am informed 40 pieces of Cannon are
      in Store at Bermuda besides a number of fine Ordnance in the Forts round the Island, and that
      there is reason to apprehend the Rebels will endeavour to carry them off. I have therefore
      acquainted Governor Bruere that I will send a Ship for the preservation of the Kings Stores,
      and the Support of his Majesty's Government there, the moment it is in my power, which I shall
      accordingly do.</P>
   <P>The Halifax anchored at Nantasket the first inst and Lieut. Grame arrived from Virginia in the
      Mercury, with Captain Macartney under an Arrest in consequence of a Complaint against him by
      Lord Dunmore Governor of Virginia, of which Complaint I acquainted you in my Letter August
      17th and transmitted Copies of Lord Dunmore's accusation, of my Answer, and of Captain George
      Montagu's Answer upon my requiring him to inform me of such Facts relative to Captain
      Macartney's misconduct as had come to his knowledge. I now inclose a Copy of another Letter to
      me from Lord Dunmore, two from Captain Macartney and my Answers; these contain the whole of
      this Business that I am acquainted with: It is at present impossible for his Lordship to come
      here to prosecute his Charge. The accusation is so controvertible that if a Court Martial was
      ordered to sit, in all likelihood from want of evidence no satisfactory Judgement could be
      given, and above all the Service at this Juncture not admitting of long trials, I have granted
      Captain Macartney's request to send him to England, there to be disposed of as their Lordships
      may think best. My Letter to Lord Dunmore on receiving his Lordship's accusation against
      Captain Macartney fully shewed the opinion I entertained of that Gentleman's abilities as an
      Officer; farther in justice to him I desire to represent that the Account of Proceedings on
      his passage to Virginia, transmitted to me before he knew of his suspension, met my entire
      approbation. I shall continue Lieutenant Grame acting by my order in the Mercury, and not
      discharge Captain Macartney until I am honoured with their Lordships Commands. </P>
   <P>His Majesty's <name>Sloop Raven</name> arrived the 4th inst after a long and tedious passage from Plymouth;
      By Captain [John] Stanhope I received their Lordships Orders and your Letters agreeable to the
      inclosed List. </P>
   <P>Finding that forbearing to punish the people of the four New England Governments, for their
      many rebellious and pyratical Acts, only encouraged them to go greater lengths, I determined
      to observe a different Conduct, and if possible destroy some of their Towns and Shipping. To
      this end I sent General Gage a Letter dated Sepr 1st a Copy of which and of his Answer is
      inclosed: many difficulties occurred in the procuring and equipping the Symmetry Transport and
      Spitfire Sloop with proper Stores for the Expedition, and, the weak State of the Garrison
      hardly allowing any Draughts to be made, General Gage could spare but One hundred Men;
      commanded by Captain Lieut. Forster of Marines with a subaltern Officer. The Command of the
      whole consisting of the Vessels as pr Margin I have given to Lieut. [Henry] Mowat of the
      Canceaux armed Ship, solely from his being well acquainted with the Pilotage; of the Coast,
      where his operations are to be carried on. I have ordered him</P>
   <P>Canceaux armed Ship</P>
   <P>to take the Advantage of Wind and Weather</P>
   <P>Hallifax armed Schr</P>
   <P>and enter any of the Harbours to the Eastward</P>
   <P>Symmetry armed Transpt</P>
   <P>of Boston; and if possible first to go to Cape</P>
   <P>Spitfire armed Sloop</P>
   <P>Anne where the Rebels thought proper to fire upon the Falcon and where they took several of
      her Officers and Crew, and sent them prisoners in the Country; Lieut. Mowats Orders are to
      burn and lay waste the Towns and destroy the Shipping in Harbours when they cannot with Ease
      be taken away. This flying Squadron lay ready to depart when the Raven arrived. Their
      Lordships Orders by her coinciding exactly with what was then doing gave me great pleasure;
      The few little advantages the Rebels have had over us have given them confidence, and there is
      no doubt of his Majesty's Ships being fired upon and opposed in every place where the Rebels
      can do it with impunity or with a Shadow of success. I have ordered Mr Mowat to protect the
      person and property of his Majesty's loyal Subjects wherever they can be distinguished; And he
      sailed Yesterday the 8th instant from Nantasket. </P>
   <P>On the 5th instant the Nautilus returned with three Brigs, two of them Captain Collins had
      taken, 3 and according to his Orders carried them to Rhode Island, from whence Captain [James]
      Wallace sent them to Boston; I inclose a Copy of Captain Wallace's Letter. </P>
   <P>The Fowey sailed Yesterday for Halifax. The Nautilus is to cruize a few days in the Bay, where
      a Rebel Schooner last Saturday chaced and fired four Shot at one of the Transports coming in
      from Newfoundland. </P>
   <P>General Gage being ordered to England takes his passage in the Pallas Transport. I have
      appointed the Mercury to convoy his Excellency over St George's Bank and I expect he will sail
      Tomorrow. </P>
   <P>I have ordered the Raven to lie in Nantasket, and the Scarborough to come up to be caulked,
      which she is in great Want of.</P>
   <P>Inclosed is the State and Condition and Disposition of his Majesty's Squadron under my Command
      and a State of the Hospital. I am Sir &amp;c</P>

   <P>Newport, October 9.</P>
   <P>By the motions of some of the men of war and transports, in this harbour, last Monday [October
      2], it was suspected they intended to take off live stock from the farms on the south part of
      this island, called Brenton's Neck, the ensuing night; whereupon a number of persons went down
      in the evening and brought off about 1000 sheep and between 40 and 50 head of horned cattle
      from several farms: But there still remained a considerable number of cattle, sheap and hogs,
      on two farms belonging to Jahleel and <name>Benjamin Brenton</name>, great part of which 'tis supposed were
      by them there collected for and sold to the men of war, to be sent to Boston, for the express
      purpose of supplying our inveterate enemies. - The next day the ships took off, from said
      Brentons farms, about 25 head of cattle and 150 sheep; on Wednesday they took 5 or 6 more
      cattle. There being still left on the farms of James, Jahleel and <name>Benjamin Brenton</name>, between 60
      and 70 head of cattle. On Wednesday, and Thursday morning, about 300 Minute-men arrived here
      from the county of Providence, Tiverton and Little Compton, under the command of the Cols.
      <name>Eseck Hopkins</name> and <name>William Richmond</name>, Esqrs; and as soon as they had refreshed themselves, they
      marched into the Neck, and brought off 66 horned cattle, some sheep, hogs, and poultry, the
      ships the same time lying within gun shot, and discharged several cannon at them, but without
      any effect.</P>
   <P>This town having been threatened to be fired on from the men of war, on account of the armed
      force which made its appearance here, a great many of the inhabitants moved part of all their
      effects out; and many families have left the town. The carts, chaises, riding chairs, and
      trucks, were so numerous that the streets and roads were almost blocked up with them. Thursday
      and Friday being rainy and muddy, the poor women and children were much exposed in looking out
      for some place of safety; the people continued moving out very fast all Saturday and yesterday
      with their effects.</P>
   <P>It is almost impossible to conceive what infamous rascally tricks have been made use of, to
      distress this town, by the abandoned set of ministerial tool here.</P>
   <P>The ships in this harbour, last week seized several vessels, loaded with wood, from
      Long-Island; which vessels, we are well assured, had Capt. Wallace's permission to fetch wood
      for the supply of his town! </P>
   <P>Saturday afternoon the ships Rose, Glasgow and Swan, a brig with 6 guns, and 1 or 2 small kind
      of bomb mortars, 3 or 4 tenders, 2 transports, and several wood-vessels, &amp;c. making in all
      15 sail, weighed anchor and went up the river, entered the harbour at Bristol, and demanded
      three hundred sheep, which not being complied with between 8 and 9 o'clock they began a
      he[a]vy fi[r]e on s[a]id town, and continued it upwards of an hour; [in] which time, a number
      of shot went through the houses of <name>William Bradford</name>, Esq; Capt. Ingraham, damaged the church a
      little, and several shops, stables, &amp;c. The women and children, in great distress, (dark
      and rainy as it was) were obliged to leave their habitations, and seek shelter in the adjacent
      country. Between 9 and 10 o'clock, a committee was appointed to go on board, who settled the
      matter by giving or selling 40 sheep. In the small defenceless town of Bristol, were near 100
      persons very sick, and dead, at the time of this firing, and are assured two sick people
      actually died of the night. </P>
   <P>We hear the men of war have cut up a quantity of corn at Poposquash or Hog Island.</P>
   <P>Early on Thursday morning sailed, the Viper sloop of war, wind N. E. supposed to be gone to
      New York.</P>

      Boston; three of them belong to <name>Jerathmael Bower</name>, of the Massachusetts-Bay, in which Mr. Bower
      has lost upwards of 10,000£. Lawful Money.</P>
   <P>His Majesty's Sloop of War the Viper, arrived here last Saturday [October 7], in 30 Hours from
      Rhode-Island. She left England after the News arrived there of the Battle of Bunker's-Hill, is
      but 14 Days from Boston, and has brought Dispatches for all his Majesty's Governors on the
      Continent: We hear she is to sail in a few Days for the Southern Governments.</P>
   <P>We are informed from undoubted Authority, that Lord <name>William Campbell</name>, Governor of
      South-Carolina, has fled with the utmost Precipitation, on board the Man of War in the
      Harbour. The committee of Charlestown having very fortunately discovered that his Excellency
      had employed one Cameron, an Indian Commissary in the interior Parts of that province, to
      engage the Indians in the Ministerial Service, who had actually inlisted 600 of them, and
      furnished them with every Necessary in order to Butcher the back Inhabitants. This Plan was
      discovered by a Gentleman who seized the Express on his Way from said Cameron to the Governor,
      whom he knew to be disaffected to the American Cause, and conveyed the Dispatches to the
      Provincial Committee. The above Gentleman disguised himself in a Drover's Habit, and attended
      the Express to the Governor's House, and heard the Conversation between them, and then
      discovered the whole Plot to the Committee.</P>
   <P>We hear Capt. Wallace has made a Demand from the Inhabitants of Newport, of all the Live Stock
      they could spare from the Island. The Inhabitants had only three Days to consider of the
      Matter. </P>

   <P>New York 9th October 1775.</P>
   <P>The town is at present much more quiet than it has been, those people who in consequence of
      our firing had removed to the Country are all returned, and such as are known to be friends to
      Government do not seem to be under so great apprehensions as they were a short time ago - I
      cannot pretend to say what occasions their present quiet, but it is thought by some that
      several of their principals are not so sanguine as they have been; they find that they have
      lost all their Friends in England, and it has been reported that they have met with a
      considerable loss at Saint Johns, but they keep every thing that is against themselves so
      secret, that the truth cannot be come at; All the Connecticut Rabble that were here are gone
      up the Country to join the rest, at the Isle aux Noix - Nothing transpires that is doing at
      the Continental Congress, only that we hear there has been a dispute amongst the Delegates
      whether Hancock or Randolph shall be President. [John] Adams denies having written the Letter
      that was intercepted, but they dont believe him - The 29th of last Month was the day on which
      the City Magistrates were Chosen, it was imagined that the Mob Party wou'd do every thing in
      their Power to get some of their Set Elected for this purpose Hand Bills were distributed
      about the day before with a list of those Men whom they recommended, and the Sons of Liberty
      were invited to meet on the Morning of Election, at the Liberty Pole this appeared like
      advertising for a Mob, but these proceedings availed nothing every thing went on very quietly
      and the Magistrates of the last Year were rechosen; Who, (tho I know not any thing they have
      ever done to deserve to be regarded) are yet much better than many who might have been put in
      their places - The Governor continues on shore unmolested, but I cannot help saying, that I
      wish he was on board; I send you Enclosed two Extracts from Letters from Lord Dartmouth to his
      Excellency which he transmitted to me about three weeks ago. </P>
   <P>Captain [Samuel] Holland resides at Amboy in the Jersey's in which town I understand the
      people are in general well affected. He has sent to England his most valuable Drawings, should
      he make any Application to me I shall be sure to give him every possible Assistance.</P>
   <P>I have this Morning received advice, which I believe to be certain, that Doctor Franklin, Mr
      [Thomas] Lynch of South Carolina and Colo [Benjamin] Harrison of Virginia have been sent from
      the Continental Congress as a Committee to Cambridge, it is pretended here, that they are gone
      with Orders to Washington to attack the King's Troops before the Reinforcements which are
      expected from Europe Arrive. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>M. de Choiseul</name> Commandant at Martinque in my absence has just given me an account of the
      improper and throughtless behavior engaged in by Mr. <name>Grant Gordon</name> commanding the English
      frigate Argo at anchor in St. Pierre road. This conduct compels me to make a formal protest
      and it places me in the position of requesting your Excellency for an explanation in order to
      know whether that Officer has been authorized to examine several ships anchored under the
      Cannon of the road, among them one flying the French Flag which he has caused to be lowered in
      order to substitute that of Great Britain. </P>
   <P>This violent act can not have your approval, and I hope that Your Excellency will give Orders
      to the Officers commanding men of war, that in the future they will conduct themselves in such
      manner as to give no offense to the good understanding which ought to be maintained between
      our two nations, and that he will let me know his intentions in this regard, in order that I
      can give an account to my Court, I am unable to conceal from Your Excellency, that a
      repetition of this nature will compel me to close our Ports to English men of war, and to
      repel with force those who would undertake any enterprise contrary to the law and the honor of
      the Nation. </P>
   <P>The event of Mr. <name>Grant Gordon</name>'s irregular conduct occasioned a disturbance among the populace
      of St. Pierre, which without the presence of <name>M. de Choiseul</name> could have been difficult for the
      Officers, and for the English Sailors who found themselves ashore: It is of the utmost
      importance not to tolerate similar imprudences, and I flatter myself that Your Excellency will
      feel, like me, the extreme importance of it, and that he will cooperate with me toward the
      most secure means to continue the union and friendship which has reigned until now between the
      respective governments of these Colonies </P>

   <P>A small Ship of War came in to our Harbour off the Watch-House Point and Fired on a Schooner
      which was armed by this Country. 2 We of this town carried down to the Point two Field Pieces
      and fired several shot at the Man of War, which obliged her as soon as the tide permitted to
      go off. No man killed on either side as we know of. <name>David Newall</name>'s hand blowed off in loading

   <P>2. An account of this incident gathered from eye-witnesses is in <name>Edwin M. Stone</name>'s History of
      Beverly, Civil and Ecclesiastical from its Settlement in 1630 to 1842 (Boston, 1843), 64-66,
      and reads as follows: </P>
   <P>One morning in the autumn of 1775, a privateer schooner sailed from Beverly on a cruise. She
      had not been out long, when she was discovered by the British ship of war Nautilus, of twenty
      guns, who immediately bore down upon her. The superior force of the enemy induced the captain
      to put back. The chase was continued until he gained the harbor and grounded on the flats. It
      being ebb-tide, the Nautilus came to anchor outside the bar, and opened a fire on the town.
      The meetinghouse being the most conspicuous object, several shots were aimed at it, one of
      which penetrated the chaise-house of <name>Thomas Stephens</name>, destroying his chaise, and another
      struck the chimney of a house on the opposite side of the street, scattering its fragments in
      every direction. This unceremonious assault proved too much for the equanimity of its
      patriotic occupant. He seized his musket, and rushing to the beach, returned the compliment
      with hearty good will. Immediately upon the commencement of firing, many females residing in
      exposed situations, hastily retired to places of greater security. There were some, however,
      who, &quot;made of sterner stuff,&quot; paid little attention to this demonstration of
      hostility, and continued their domestic occupations as though nothing uncommon was going on.
      Of this class, was a good lady, the wife of a devoted friend to American freedom, who was at
      the moment engaged in preparing a batch of bread for the oven. The house she occupied was
      directly in the range of the meeting-house, and liable to be struck by every discharge. Her
      brother, anxious for her safety, came in, and informing her of the danger, desired her to take
      her child, and proceed by a circuitous route to a place beyond the reach of the enemy's guns,
      while he would rally a company to resist any attempt to land. To this she demurred; she felt
      no alarm. Besides, her oven was heating, the bread was nearly ready; and as to leaving before
      it was set in, she could not think of it! She was finally prevailed on to forego this
      resolution and retire. As she was passing around the south-eastern corner of the common,
      curiosity prevailed over apprehension, and, climbing upon the wall, she stood in full view of
      the enemy's vessel, surveying the scene, until a cannon-ball striking the earth near her, gave
      decided intimation that it was time to depart. </P>
   <P>The alarm spread rapidly, and soon men were seen with their fire-arms hurrying from, every
      quarter to the defence of the landing. Among the earliest on the ground, was Col. Henry
      Herrick, an active member of the committee of correspondence, and whose patriotic spirit
      greatly contributed to the energetic action of the town in furnishing men and supplies for the
      army. The confusion of the moment did not make him forgetful of the dignity of his official
      character; and with characteristic regard for effect, and disregard of danger, he appeared on
      the beach in full military costume, a conspicuous mark for the enemy's aim. The commander of
      the Nautilus soon found himself in an awkward position. Owing to an unlucky choice of
      anchorage, the receding tide left his vessel aground, which careened so that he was unable to
      bring a single gun to bear. In the mean time, the citizens of Salem opened a fire upon her
      from the Hospital point, with several four and six pounders, while a number of good marksmen,
      concealed among the rocks on the Beverly side, rendered it hazardous for an officer or man to
      appear on deck. In this condition, without power to offer a single token of his good or ill
      will, he lay until dark, when, the tide floating his vessel, he weighed anchor and stood out
      to sea, carrying with him no very pleasant recollection of his introduction to the citizens of
      this town. </P>

      upon her after she had run aground and was stripped for abt 4 hours. The Salem people, to the
      no of 200 or more went down upon Salem Neck &amp; were preparing to fire upon the Ship with
      their field pieces when she fired the first shot among a party of them wo were collected upon
      a hill. I was myself present. Our men then began to play their 4 lb guns &amp; after making 8
      or 10 shot apiece they levelled them well. The Ship fired several times at us but after our
      Guns began to play she fired but seldom, and hoisted sail to go off - when she got aground -
      she got off agn abt ½ after 7 P.M. - for 4 hours we fired upon her constantly &amp; tis
      supposed that she recd some of our shot - We fired very badly many times. </P>

   <P>A number of Men of War &amp; Transports appear'd off Bristol last Saturday &amp; there
      demanded a quantity of Cattle &amp; Sheep, upon refusal of the Inhabitants (who by the bye,
      where then very sickley) they Cannon'd &amp; Bomber'd the Town for three hours, but happely
      without distroying any lives, except <name>Parson Burt</name>, who died thro' fear, 'as is suppos'd, being
      found dead in his Cornfield the next morning; the Inhabitants being thus distress'd &amp;
      terrefied desir'd the Ships to stop their fireing &amp; they wou'd accomidate the matter,
      accordingly they consented to leave the Town if they wou'd give 'em 40 Sheep, which was
      accordingly comply'd with, thus ended this pritty d--ble affair - a fine precedent for the
      future to git provisions. - Our Friends &amp; Famelies are at present all well . . . Salt

   <P>I have just received a Letter by Express from Mr President Hancock with Orders to dispatch our
      armed Vessels to intercept Two Brig's from England to Quebec. Our large Vessel is upon a
      Voyage to Bermuda and the small One is unfit for the Service. I have given Information of this
      to <name>Genl Washington</name> &amp; Gov. Trumbull that they may not make any Reliance upon our assisting
      in this important Expedition. - I have strongly recommended to the latter to employ their
      Colony Brig which is fitted and mounts 14 Carriage Guns in this Enterprize. I am not without
      Hopes however that the large Sloop will return in a Day or Two; in which Case I shall have her
      immediately cleaned and dispatch her. I am Gent. [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>This Morning Mr. Tryon came over and informed Mr. [John] Plenderleath that last Night the
      King's Stores in the Garrett of the lower Barracks were carried away by armed Men in 12 Carts,
      &amp; that he wished him to inform me of it - adding that he had demanded Restitution of the
      Magistrates &amp; written to Capt Vanderput that he expected to be seized, in which case he
      wished him to execute his orders, &amp; he expected a firing upon the Town. I went to the City
      Hall &amp; called my Brother [<name>Thomas Smith</name>] out of the [Provincial] Congress. He said they
      were informed of the Transaction - That it was the Feat of a drunken Guard in the Barracks
      Commanded by Colo [John] Lasher as Capt. of the Grenadiers. That the Congress thought
      themselves ill used, &amp; would order immediate Restitution. They did so and Restitution was
      made before 2 A.M. . . The Congress were unanimous on this Occasion &amp; were some of them
      for breaking the Officers concerned in the work. . . . The Soldiers concerned in this Business
      had a Review on the Afternoon preceding it, &amp; as a Proof of their being treated with
      Liquor, they mounted Guard in the lower Apartments of the very House in which the goods were
      and sent them to [Peter] Curtenius's the Provincial Commissary where they were less secure. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Having received a Letter of which the inclosed is a Copy, from <name>David Wooster</name>, One who
      commanded a Body of Men from Connecticut, at that time encamped about eight Miles from the
      City of New York, I take the earliest opportunity of transmitting a Copy of the same to you it
      relates, with the inclosed Affadavits to the Case of a Man whom I took out of a Passage Boat,
      and have detained on the Charge, of the Midshipman and Boats Crew belonging to the Pinnace,
      for having forcibly obliged them to go above a Mile to the House of the said Wooster, who
      thereupon gave the Orders which he sets forth in this Letter; the Prisoner whose Name is Edd
      Tiley says he is an Ensign in the Connecticut Militia, raised by the Governor and Assembly of
      that Province, and in his Justification affirms that having endeavour'd in vain to dissuade
      the Mob from Seizing the Boat, that his motive for taking the Crew to his Officer was to
      protect them from any Injury that might be done them by the People of the Town, what followed
      is I believe truly stated in Woosters Account, &amp; by the Affadavits. Wooster's Letter I did
      not answer. But beg leave to refer the Case to you, and to have your Order about the Man. I am

   <P>Philadelphia, Oct. 10th, 1775.</P>
   <P>The ministry were determined to push the war with vigor, a measure in which they were fixed by
      the defeat of the Spaniards by the Moors. 90. brass cannon were embarked from the tower and
      may be hourly expected either at <name>N. York</name> or Boston. 2000 troops were to sail from Ireland
      about the 25th. Sep. These we have reason to beleive are destined for <name>N. York</name>. Commodore
      Shuldam was to sail about the same time with a great number of frigates and small vessels of
      war to be distributed among the middle colonies. He comes at the express and earnest
      intercessions of Ld. Dunmore, and the plan is to lay waste all the plantations on our river
      sides. Of this we gave immediate notice to our committee of safety by an express whom we
      dispatched hence last Friday [October 6], that if any defence could be provided on the rivers
      by fortifications or small vessels it might be done immediately. In the spring 10,000 men more
      are to come over. They are to be procured by taking away two thirds of the Garrison at
      Gibralter (who are to be replaced by some Hessians) by 2000 Highlanders and 5000 Roman
      Catholics whom they propose to raise in Ireland. Instead of the Roman Catholics however some
      of our accounts say foreigners are to be sent. Their plan is this. They are to take possession
      of New York and Albany, keeping up a communication between them by means of their vessels.
      Between Albany and <name>St. John</name>'s they propose also to keep open the communication; and again
      between <name>St. John</name>'s, Quebec, and Boston. By this means they expect Gage, Tryon and Carleton may
      distress us on every side acting in concert with one another. By means of Hudson's river they
      expect to cut off all correspondence between the Northern and Southern rivers. </P>

      am very Solicitous to hear; -</P>
   <P>I can not give you any more news from this than Mrs Campbell &amp; Fanny will Communicate to
      you - The Situation of this Town is really precarious, Nothing less is talkd of by the Warm
      Patriots than destroying it, for fear it Should fall in to Lord Dunmore's hands, who I am
      told, momently expects, four or five hundred Men Should they arrive its imagind he will take
      immediate possestion at any rate property here is very insecure, Most of the Inhabitants have
      removed their effects, as they are equally allarmed, at the regulars or Provincialls being
      Masters of it. Our reguler Provincial Troops are I am told rised but, they meet with a good
      deal of Difficulty in rising Minute Men. if Matters are not Soon Accomodated, this will be a
      very disagreable Country to live in &amp; I am determined tho I know my Interest will Suffer
      greatly to remove my Self this winter, and Hope to eat My Christmas Dinner with you. -</P>
   <P>There is papers from England down to the 2d of August, there are five thousand Men more coming
      out &amp; fifty Sail of Men of War, to be on the American Station and from all Accounts they
      mean to Inforce their Supremecy over the Colonys; On the other hand there is no Doubt but it
      was agitated in Congress to through [throw] of[f] their dependance on Great Brittain. -
      Nothing Material from the Norward, but what a few Papers I have inclosd will give you - You
      See our Press is Stopt by an Arbitrary Actt of Lord Dunmores, &amp; of Coarse you loos your

   <P>The Committee of Safety for the Town of Portsmouth have represented to us that the Ship Prince
      George Capt <name>Richard Emms</name> Master from Bristol bound to Boston with Provisions for the Army
      there, is now in their Port &amp; in their Custody, that they had represented the Matter to
      your Excellency, &amp; that You had desired the whole Cargo might be forwarded to the Army
      under your Command - This Colony have upward of a hundred Soldiers stationed at the Batteries
      erecting in our Port, and often Two hundred more in a Day from the Country working on the
      Batteries and there is not, nor has there been for some Weeks past a single Barrel of Flour to
      be purchased within this Colony; We therefore thinking it necessary for the Promotion of the
      Common Cause have ordered a hundred Barrels of the Flour to be taken for the use of the said
      Soldiers, &amp; doubt not it will Meet with Yr Excellencie's Approbation - And as the Town of
      Portsmouth is in great want of Bread, we should be exceeding glad if the Circumstances of the
      Army will admit of it, that about Five hundred Barrels of the Flour might be sold to the
      Inhabitants of said Portsmouth &amp; the Money desposited in the hands of some faithful Person
      until the Determination of the Continental Congress relative to the said Cargo may be known </P>
   <P>The Sailors appear to be pleased with the Capture, but are uneasy about their Wages, &amp; we
      would request your opinion whether or not they should be paid by the Sale of some Part of the
      Cargo. </P>
   <P>We would also propose to your Excellencys Consideration whether the transporting the Flour
      round <name>Cape Ann</name> will not be dangerous; We conceive it more prudent to convey it in Small
      Vessels to Ipswich, tho the Land Carriage from thence is further than from Marblehead than to
      risque it round the Cape -</P>
   <P>Your Excellencys Sentiments on t_hese Matters will much oblige us:-In behalf of the Committee

      cannot be got ready sooner, as we have just received very important Advices respecting the
      Dispatch of a Number of Transports from England which may be hourly expected on the Coast. The
      General therefore directs that you will immediately set every Hand to Work that Can be
      procured &amp; not a Moment of Time be lost in getting them ready. One of you will also
      proceed immediately to Newbury &amp; take up a fourth Vessel on the Same Service, there are
      Carpenters, Guns &amp;c, to be had there in plenty &amp; let the Same Expedition be also used
      as to this Vessel - One Day [before] the Vessels are ready to Sail you will give us Notice
      that we may dispatch the Crews -</P>
   <P>In the Equipment of the two first Vessels let the Agents lay in the Provissions for 6 Weeks
      with Water accordingly for 70 Men - Should Mr Moylan be gone to Portsmouth <name>Colo Glover</name> is
      directed to forward the Express with this Letter that he may immeidately return to Newbury
      Port to take up the 4th Vessel - Which he will do on the best Terms &amp; let us know what he
      will want to equip the Vessel for the Sea. The General approves of the Steps taken respecting

   <P>The Committee on the Proceedings of the Committee of Deer-Island, relative to the Schooner

      accepted; and it was pass'd in the negative.</P>
   <P>It was then moved that a Committee be appointed to bring in a Resolve directing the said
      Committee of Deer-Island, to retain the Schooner above-mentioned in their Custody, 'till the

   <P>Message from a Majority of the honorable Council, viz. </P>
   <P>Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,</P>
   <P>We have taken under Consideration your Message of the Ninth Instant, relative to certain armed
      Vessels at Long-Island, near Penobscot, to protect and guard those who are employed in cutting
      and transporting Wood to Boston, for the Use of the Ministerial Army; and after the strictest
      Enquiry, we find that there are now, or very lately have been, sixteen Vessels at Long-Island,
      one twenty Gun Ship, one of sixteen Guns, two Tenders, ten large Transports, and two Wood
      Sloops who are taking Wood from thence. And that Col. [James] Cargill had ten Days since,
      collected about five Hundred Men, with sixteen Days Provisions, and a sufficient Number of
      Boats to transport them from the Main to the said Island; that he apprehended he had a Force
      sufficient to prevent the Enemy's executing their Purpose. It does not therefore, appear to us
      necessary at present to make any further Provision. </P>
   <P>Read and Ordered to lie. </P>
   <P>The House resumed the Consideration of the Report of the Committee relative to the Schooner
      Nightingale. It was then moved that the same be now accepted, and the Question being put, it

   <Title>NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL <name>SAMUEL GRAVES</name> 1</Title>
   <P>[Preston, Boston]</P>
   <P>The next day [October 11] . . . it was suggested to the latter [Graves] that before the
      Transports could possibly get to the mouth of the River <name>St Lawrence</name>, Winter would be too far
      set in, and that Snow Storms would so endanger both Men and Vessels that it was very unlikely
      they should be able even to enter the River; And that therefore it was utterly improbable they
      should ever reach Quebec or even make their way back again to Boston, where the Cruizers
      already found the greatest difficulty in keeping their Stations. The excessive swift descent
      of the Tide in the River <name>St Lawrence</name> (the Ebb running for nine hours together and often after
      the rate of ten miles an hour, and the flood making but three hours) very greatly increased
      the peril and difficulty of the navigation, which were again augmented by the intense
      obscurity of Fogs, and the violent impetuosity of the N.W. Winds prevailing at, that Season:
      all combining rendered the art of the Navigator useless; nor could the most skilful Pilot
      venture much beyond what the Sight would conduct him to. It would be impracticable to anchor,
      the strongest Cable being incapable of holding a Ship against the rapidity of the Tides, and
      to keep under Sail would be almost certain destruction; insomuch that Ships had been
      frequently obliged to quit the River from its inclement Coast and retreat across the Atlantic
      to Europe. Upon these Considerations the Admiral, whose Earnestness to send Succours had
      induced him to hold the Cerberus in readiness for that Service, thought it behoved him to take
      the opinion of Pilots and Seamen, &amp; in particular to consult Captain [Broderick] Hartwell,
      who had commanded the Neptune under Sir <name>Chas Saund</name>[ers] at the Siege of Quebec, and was judged
      well acquainted with the River <name>St Lawrence</name>; and the time of the Winters setting in there. They
      all concurred in opinion: &amp; the very experienced Officer just mentioned declared frankly
      that as the Transports could not be ready to sail for several days to come, they must arrive
      too late in the Gulph of <name>St Lawrence</name> to get up; that they would be in the utmost peril of
      being lost, and that; should nothing fatal happen to them, they would be obliged to run for
      England: he therefore strenuously advised the Admiral by no means to think of putting the
      Lives of so many men in such Jeopardy. Captain Macartney, who had wintered at Quebec, agreed
      with Captain Hartwell; And both urged so much and so strongly against the measure proposed
      that the Admiral at last adopted their Sentiments, and by Letter to General Howe communicated
      the same to him. </P>

      the County of Monmouth, until this Congress can obtain satisfactory information respecting
      those persons, their business and destination. And this Congress request the Committee of

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P><name>Philada Octr</name> 11th 1775.</P>
   <P>The Congress have considered your Letters of the 19th and 29th of Sept last, and directed me
      to assure you, that they are very sensible of the Difficulties under which you labour, and
      your unremitted Dilligence to remove such as may in any wise obstruct the public service. They
      most heartily lament the Loss of your Health, as well on your own, as on Account of the
      Public, but find some Pleasure in thinking that you are not without Consolation, when you
      reflect, that the Obligations of your Country are Encreased in Proportion to the Sacrifices
      you make to her Interest. Their Concern for the Public is greatly alliviated by the Abilities
      and Zeal of <name>Genl Montgomery</name>, in which they cannot but place the highest Confidence.</P>
   <P>The Congress see the Necessity of attending to the Situation of Canada, but trust that your
      Care and Prudence will render any Delegation from this Body unnecessary, at least for the
      present. What they expect from your Endeavours is, that the Canadians be induced to accede to
      an Union with these Colonies, and that they form from their several Parishes a Provincial
      Convention and send Delegates to this Congress. And as in the present unsettled State of that
      Country, a regular Election can hardly be expected, we must acquiesce in the Choice of such
      Parishes and Districts as are disposed to join us. </P>
   <P>You may assure them that we shall hold their Rights as dear as our own, and on their Union
      with us, exert out utmost Endeavours to obtain for them and their Posterity the Blessings of a
      free Government, and that Security to their Persons and Property, which is derived from the
      British Constitution. And you may further declare that we hold sacred the Rights of
      Conscience, and shall never molest them in the free Enjoyment of their Religion. </P>
   <P>If our Arms should be crowned with Success, you will consult with your principal Officers
      about the Number of Troops that will be necessary for the Defence of Canada, and for the
      different Posts of Crown Point and Ticonderoga, and the best Method of procuring Men for those
      Services. If you should observe in the Canadians an inclination to take up arms, you may
      immediately, at the Expence of the Continent, raise a Regiment and appoint such officers as
      you conceive will be most agreeable to them, and serviceable to us. - The Congress will
      endeavour to attend to the Cloathing of your Troops, and approve of your design to purchase
      Woollens at Montreal, which they sincerely hope it may be in your Power to accomplish. You may
      depend upon their Compliance with all Contracts made by you for the Supply of the Troops under
      your Command. </P>
   <P>The Establishment of a Civil Government in Canada is a Subject of great Consequence, and
      requires the most deliberate councils. The Temper, the Disposition and local Circumstances of
      our Brethern in that Colony must be known, before we can form a proper Judgment on so
      important a Question. You will endeavour therefore to collect the Sentiments of the most
      discreet and sensible among the principal Canadians and English on this Head, and communicate
      their opinion, with your remarks to the Congress. </P>
   <P>It is the Determination of the Congress at all Events, to keep the Command of Lake Champlain.
      They would therefore have the most effectual Measures adopted for that Purpose; and, if our
      Enemies should be expelled Montreal, will exert their utmost Endeavours to secure the River St
      Lawrence, and prevent by Batteries, Vessels, and every other Obstruction the ministerial
      Troops from regaining the Possession of that Town. </P>
   <P>The Congress approve of the Presents made to the Coghniwagas, also of the Disposition of the
      prisoners, and have borrowed one Ton of gun Powder from the Committee of Safety of this
      Colony, and directed it to be sent to the Provincial Convention of New York, with a request to
      transmit to you the whole, or such a Part of it, as they can spare: Nails will be supplied
      you, by the Convention of New York, when they receive your Direction on that Head. They,
      together with the Committee of Albany, and the Governor of Connecticut will on Application,
      furnish such Carpenters and Blacksmiths, as you may want over and above what may be procured
      from among the Troops. As for the Artificers taken from thence, you will pay them the
      customary Allowance if you think their Services entitle them to any Reward. The Congress are
      pleased with the Mode in which you propose to settle with and pay those, who took and
      garrisoned Crown Point, and desire that the Accounts may be transmitted to them as soon as
      possible. </P>
   <P>Mr [Elisha] Phelps will be considered as Deputy to Mr Levingston [<name>Walter Livingston</name>] for the
      New York Department, and be paid as such at the Rate of forty Dollars per Month from his
      Entrance into the Service. </P>
   <P>The Congress are greatly hurt at the Misconduct of a Part of the Troops, and hope they will
      take the earliest Opportunity to obliterate their Disgrace. It is their earnest Wish, that the
      strictest Discipline be observed; For, as on the one Hand, they are resolved to reward those,
      who deserve their Favour, so on the other, a Regard for their Country forbids them to overlook
      the Offences of such as neglect their Duty, or basely betray their trust. </P>
   <P>I cannot conclude without assuring you, that the Congress are highly sensible of the Spirit,
      Activity, and Zeal, of Mr. <name>James Levingston</name> [Livingston], from which they cannot but promise
      themselves Advantages, that will be entitled to their earliest Recompense. I have the Honour

   <P>The armourers in the Tower work sixteen hours (in the room of twelve) by order of the Board of
      Ordnance. </P>
   <P>August 2. It is said Governor [James] Wright, of Georgia, is made prisoner by the people. (A
      Tory Lie.) 1 </P>
   <P>The Americans seem to out number us in Generals, there appearing from several of their
      accounts to be the following, viz. General [Israel] Putnam, Gen. Pomroy [<name>Seth Pomeroy</name>], Gen.
      Washington, Gen. [Charles] Lee, Gen. [Artemas] Ward, and Gen. Doctor [Joseph] Warren, killed
      in the late engagements, besides other superior Commanders, as Col. <name>Ethan Allen</name>, at
      Ticonderoga, and Col. [Patrick] Henry, at Virginia, &amp;c.&amp;c. </P>
   <P>August 3. The public may be assured, that by orders from above, a frigate of twenty-eight guns
      is fitting up at Woolwich, for sea, with all practicable speed, the officers cabins are upon
      the quarter deck, or in the gun-room, the great, or Captain's cabin is lined with crimson
      baize; she is otherwise prepared and decorated with every thing commodious and proper for her
      intended destination, which is Virginia, where she is to accomodate the governor Lord Dunmore,
      and enable him to receive deputations from the Council and Burgesses of that province, when
      assembled, with greater conveniency; she may also serve to receive delegations from the
      Caghnawaga Indians, to induce them to take up the hatchet, and boil the war-kettle - Lady
      Dunmore is just arrived in England, or it might have enabled her Ladyship, with equal
      propriety, and perhaps, with equal success, to have given balls on board, to the Planters
      Ladies upon the intervening days! What a deep business! What a secrecy! What dispatch is
      necessary! Who can wonder at the many councils which have been lately held! </P>
   <P>August 4. In consequence of General Gage's new Commission, the Patents of all the Governors of
      the Provinces in America, we hear, will be recalled, and others made out consonant thereto. </P>
   <P>General Washington, who was lately appointed Generalissimo over the Provincials, has refused
      any Salary, and is to attend to the hazardous duty alloted him from principle only. A most
      noble example, and worthy of imitation in Great-Britain, particularly at this time; for if
      there were a few disinterested Patriots, like Washington, the Supplies of the Mother Country
      would soon lessen the national debt without any requisition from the Colonies. </P>
   <P>Eight men of war, from forty to fifty guns each, are ordered for the American station; some
      ships now there being ordered home, as too large for the service. </P>
   <P>A plan for reducing the rebellious Colony of New-England, and for the support of a legal
      Constitutional Government in America. </P>
   <P>To fortify Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. -</P>
   <P>To garrison each place with 3000 troops. -</P>
   <P>To keep cruizing upon the American Coast three squadrons, each consisting of three 74 gun
      ships, three armed sloops, three schooners, three bomb vessels, and a battalion of Marines. -
      These three maritime pendulums moving upon the American Coast, would support the three
      garrisons, maintain the power of government, prevent illicit trade, and give full protection
      to fair and just Commerce. During the winter, two Squadrons of the fleet to rendezvous at St.
      Augustine, for reasons too obvious to mention. -</P>
   <P>To disarm the Commercial Colonies. -</P>
   <P>Upon petitioning Government, to receive any military force that may be necessary, during war,
      to supply a number of recruits only for army and navy. -</P>
   <P>Martial law to be fixed in the Colony of Connecticut, till full submission is made to
      Government. -</P>
   <P>All forfeited estates to be granted to loyal Americans. </P>
   <P>Canadian troops to possess Connecticiut till all Rebellion ceases. -</P>
   <P>The cordon of forts from Quebec to the Mississippi, to be garrisoned from thence, and by the
      Indian subjects. -</P>
   <P>All ships trading in America, to be registered as British ships, and registered in some
      English port, commanded by an Englishman. - One third of the crews natives of England. -</P>
   <P>The Agent of each Colony resident in England, to be recommended by the Upper Assembly of each
      Colony, and paid by Government in England, from the American Revenue, the annual salary of
      1500£. (A pretty plan of Slavery) </P>
   <P>August 5. It is whispered that government has ordered Gen. Gage to offer five thousand pounds
      to any person or persons who will bring him Gen. Putnam's head; this has been privately
      communicated to most of the royalists in and about Boston, who could be confided in. 2</P>
   <P>By Capt. Barry [arrived in the ship <name>Black Prince</name>] we learn, that some of the transports sailed
      from England for Ireland the beginning of August, to take in the five regiments for America. </P>
   <P>1. The parenthetical remark is by the editor of the Pennsylvania Journal.</P>

   <P>August 31st 1775;</P>
   <P>To <name>His Excellency</name> The Governor </P>
   <P>The Address of His Majesty's Council of Bermuda. - May it please Your Excellency </P>
   <P>We His Majesty's most faithful Subjects the Council of Bermuda have considered Your
      Excellency's Speech of Yesterday with all the Attention which the Importance of the matter
      recommended to us so justly demands. -</P>
   <P>We assure Your Excellency We are still Affected with the deepest and most unfeigned Concern
      for the Robbery committed on the Powder Magazine, and tho' we are happy in reflecting that
      every Method was immediately taken for the Detection of the Perpetrators of that most
      atrocious and execreable Act - which the united Wisdom of the Legislature could suggest, Yet
      we at the same time Sincerely lament that the Offenders have hitherto remained undiscovered.
      -</P>
   <P>We join with Your Excellency in Opinion that in our present defenceless State (arising
      principally from that most villainous Robbery) the utmost care shou'd be taken of the Cannon,
      but we rather beg leave to Advise that Your Excellency would be pleased [to] use Your
      Influence with Capt: Tollemache to continue here 'till he can be relieved by some other Vessel
      of War, and we are the more strongly induced to give this Measure a preference to that
      recommended by your Excellency, as a large, arm'd Sloop (supposed to be from some of the North
      American Colonies) has for several Days past been seen hovering about our Coast, - This
      Circumstance is truly alarming and gives us the greatest reason to imagine that some Attempt
      may be made against the Island, which, (should it even be with a Vessel of but small Force)
      for want of Powder and from the ruinous Condition our Fortifications are now in, we should be
      unable to defeat; We therefore flatter Ourselves that Captain Tollemache will readily comply
      with a request of this Nature from your Excellency, as it must not only tend to secure the
      Cannon alluded to in Your Excellency's Speech but also the Cannon on the several Forts and
      Fortifications, which we conceive to be in imminent Danger for the Reasons we have just
      mentioned. - By Order of the Board. -</P>
   <P>October 11th 1775. - </P>
   <P>Geo: Forbes, President. </P>
   <P>The said Address being Approved of, </P>
   <P>It was Signed by the president of the board and by him Presented to <name>His Excellency</name> - His
      Excellency was thereupon Pleased to acquaint the board that a Copy of their Address

   <Title>CouNT DE NozIERES TO VICE ADMIRAL JAMES YouNG 1</Title>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Point a Pitre, Guadeloupe, 11 October 1775</P>
   <P>I have received the letter which Your Excellency did me the honor of writing, dated 7th
      October, which has been sent to me here by the frigate of his Britannic Majesty which has
      anchored at Basse Terre: By this dispatch you tell me that Captain [Grant] Gordon, commanding
      the frigate Argo having put into the harbor at St. Pierre in Martinique has reported that a
      very pernicious trade is taking place there, [the] furnishing [of] powder and other munitions
      of war to the colonials of New England.</P>
   <P>I can assure Your Excellency that I have no knowledge of it, I gave my orders a long time ago
      that no one was to allow anything of that nature to leave our ports: But St. Pierre is a
      trading place where all the commodities of Europe are traded with every foreigner, without
      distinction; and it is quite possible that the merchant with only his own interest in view
      traded in some of these articles without my having any knowledge of it nor of their
      destination.</P>
   <P>Your Excellency tells me in the second place that these kinds of merchandize were exported in
      American Ships, which had on board French masters, and that the vessels of his Britannic
      Majesty, which encountered them at sea, seized them as contraband.</P>
   <P>I have the honor of replying on this subject to Your Excellency that, following our own laws,
      a French master would not be enough to characterize the vessel he commands as such it is
      necessary also that the greater part of the crew be composed of nationals, and that the ship
      be furnished with French sailing orders in good form and specifying its destination. Every
      ship in the state I have just described to Your Excellency could not be siezed by those of his
      Britannic Majesty without a clear infraction of maritime rights recognized among civilized
      nations unless however in the actual situation they are encountered in the vicinity of New
      England carrying munitions of war for that colony. </P>
   <P>As for the improper action of Mr. Gordon in the roadstead at St. Pierre which <name>M. de Choiseul</name>
      has told me about, I refer to what I had the honor of writing to Your Excellency by the
      Signeur de Montaigu commander of His Most <name>Christian Majesty</name>'s troops, I shall add only that
      Captain Gordon was not able to visit under any admissable grounds ships which anchor in a
      French roadstead, being under the protection of His Most <name>Christian Majesty</name>, this act of
      violence would not be suffered even in time of war in any neutral port, and Captain Gordon has
      carried his delinquency to the greatest excess by acting to haul down the colors of His Most
      <name>Christian Majesty</name> in order to substitute those of his Britannic Majesty. </P>
   <P>Therefore, I can only approve the action followed by Count de Choiseul concerning the
      indiscreet request Captain Gordon made to him in regard to seizing ships in our ports: The
      imprudent acts of Captain Gordon cannot be excused in any case, not even under the special
      pretext of an utmost Zeal for the service of his Britannic Majesty and I am entirely persuaded
      that Your Excellency cannot think otherwise. </P>
   <P>The desire I have of maintaining union and friendship, which, I hope still exists between our
      respective nations, will cause me to pay particular attention to the choice I make of the
      officers who can visit your ports, in order that their conduct cannot diminish the harmony
      which has always existed between the governments of these colonies, and I hope that Your
      Excellency will do the same in recommending to all those under his orders an equal prudence
      when they are in our ports. </P>
   <P>I have the honor of being with the greatest esteem &amp;c.</P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>In Committee of Safety, Exeter, Octr 12th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Gentlemen - On the 2d of this Inst. the ship Prince George, <name>Richard Emms</name>, Master, from Bristol
      bound to Boston with 1892 Barrels of Flour for the use of General Gage's army, came into our
      Harbour &amp; was boarded by a number of men under the command of Lieut. Pickering of the
      Matross Company, &amp; Brot up to Portsmouth, where she is detained. Gen. Washington has been
      consulted concerning her and has desired that the Cargo may be sent to the army and has
      promised to write to the Congress for their directions in what manner the Cargo should be
      disposed of, and what should be allowed the Captors &amp;c.</P>
   <P>As there is not a Barrel of flour to be sold in this Colony, &amp; we were under a necessity
      of taking a Hundred Barrels of the Flour for the support of our soldiers &amp; workmen at the
      Battery erecting on Seavey's &amp; Pierce's Islands, there being employed thereon upwards of a
      Hundred soliders besides workmen; which we have since represented to Gen. Washington with a
      proposal to sell 500 Barrels to the inhts of Portsmo &amp; deposit the money safely until
      directions from the Congress should be obtained. . . .</P>
   <P>Our Batteries are almost compleated. The work done on them will surpass your Imagination.
      Several hundreds of men from the Country round about having voluntarily labored thereon, a
      considerable part of the time since they were begun. </P>

   <P><name>William Cowley</name> of lawful Age, being duely sworn deposeth and saith that he has lived with
      Major <name>John Conolly</name> of Fort-Pitt in the Character of a Servant for two years last past - that
      the said Conolly was obliged to quit that Place fearing some Injury from the Inhabitants who
      suspected him of being an Enemy to his Country - that some Time in August last the said
      Conolly paid a Visit to Lord Dunmore on Board of his Lordship's Ship the Royal William then
      lying at Portsmouth in Virginia, and took this Deponent as his Servant - that the said Conolly
      stayed fourteen Days on Board of the said Ship and afterwards went to Boston in his Lordship's
      Tender Arundel with Dispatches to <name>Genl Gage</name> from <name>Ld Dunmore</name> where he was for the Space of ten
      Days - This Deponent further saith that after their Departure from thence the said Conolly
      asked this Deponent if he was willing to go with him into the Indian Country, told him that he
      had been with <name>Genl Gage</name> to get a Commission and Orders to go into the Indian Country to raise
      the Indians &amp; French - that there was some Part of the Royal Irish (at Fort Charter's this
      Deponent thinks he said) who had in Command from Genl/Gage to join him, and who had nine
      twelve Pounders - that assoon as he had settled his Business with Lord Dunmore after his
      Return, he intended, as he dared not go Home thro the Heart of the Country to take his
      Lordship's Tender, go to St Augustine, there get guides to lead him through the Cherokee
      Nation, Shawanese, Mingo, &amp; Delaware - that he was to get Commissions from Lord Dunmore
      for Capt. White Eyes, and Corn Stalk, and others of the Chiefs, and designed to make them
      Presents, in Order to encourage them to join him that he intends to stay at Detroit this
      Winter to furnish himself with Boats &amp; Canoes, to bring his Forces and Cannon up the Ohio
      River - that he then intends to attack <name>Fort Pitt</name>, after taking which he supposed all that Part
      of the World would join him, especially as he had Orders to give 300 Acres of Land to every
      Man that would enlist under him, - this Deponent further saith that the said Conolly informed
      him of another Scheme he had in View, namely to proclaim Freedom to all Convicts &amp;
      indented Servants, then to march down to Alexandria in Virginia where he expects a
      Reinforcement from Lord Dunmore, and to meet with some Men of War, with which he intended to
      sweep the whole Country before him. <name>William Cowley</name>.2 </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Camp at Cambridge, Octr 12th 1775.</P>
   <P>Before I was honoured with your Favour of the 5th Inst. I had given Orders for the equipment
      of some armed Vessels to intercept the Enemyies Supplies of Provisions &amp; Ammunition. One
      of them was on a Cruize between <name>Cape Ann</name> &amp; Cape Cod when the Express arrived. The others
      will be fit for the Sea in a few Days under the Command of Officers of the Continental Army,
      who are well recommended as Persons acquainted with the Sea, and capable of such a Service.
      Two of these will be immediately dispatched on this Duty, and every Particular mentioned in
      your Favour of the 5h Inst litterally complied with.</P>
   <P>That the Honble Congress may have a more complete Idea of the Plan on which these Vessels are
      equipped, I enclose a Copy of the Instructions given to the Capt. now out (No 4) 2 These, with
      the additional Instructions directed, will be given to the Captains who go into the Mouth of
      St. Lawrence's River. As both Officers &amp; Men most chearfully engage in the Service on the
      Terms mentioned in these Instructions, I fear that the proposed Encrease will create some
      Difficulty, by making a Difference between Men engaged on similar Service. I have therefore
      not yet communicated this Part of the Plan, but reserved an Extra Bounty as a Reward for
      extraordinary Activity. There are no armed Vessels in this Province, and Govr [Nicholas] Cooke
      informs me the Enterprize can receive no Assistance from him, as one of the armed Vessels of
      Rhode Island is on a long Cruize, and the other unfit for the Service. Nothing shall be
      omitted to secure Success. A fortunate Capture of an Ordnance Ship would give new Life to the
      Camp, and an immediate Turn to the Issue of the Campaign.</P>
   <P>Our last Accounts from Col. Arnold are very favourable. He was proceeding with all Expedition,
      and I flatter myself making all Allowances, he will be at Quebec the 20h Inst., where, a
      Gentleman from Canada (Mr Brice) assures me, he will meet with no Resistance . . .</P>
   <P>From the various Accounts received from Europe, there may be Reason to expect Troops will be
      landed at New York, or some other Middle Colony. I should be glad to know the Pleasure of the
      Congress whether upon such an Event it would be expected that a Part of this Army should be
      detached, or the internal Force of such Colony and its Neighbourhood be deemed sufficient, or
      whether in such Case I am to wait the particular Directions of Congress.</P>
   <P>The Fleet mentioned in my last has been seen standing N.NE, so that we apprehend it is
      intended for some Part of this Province, or New-Hampshire, or possibly Quebec . . . 3</P>
   <P>A Person who has lately been a Servant to Major [John] Conolly a Tool of Lord Dunmore has
      given an Account of a Scheme to distress the Southern Provinces which appeared to me of
      sufficient Consequence to be immediately transmitted. I have therefore got it attested, and do
      myself the Honour of enclosing it No. 5. </P>

   <P>Last Tuesday [October 10] one of our Privateers from Beverly,1 having been on a Cruize in the
      Bay, was followed, on her Return into Port, by the Nautilus Man of War. The Privateer run
      aground in a Cove a little without Beverly Harbour, where the People speedily assembled,
      stripped her, and carried her Guns, &amp;c. ashore. The Man of War was soon within Gunshot,
      when she also got aground; she however let go an Anchor, and bringing her Broadside to bear,
      began to fire upon the Privateer. The People of Salem and Beverly soon returned the Compliment
      from a Number of Cannon on Shore, keeping up a warm and well directed Fire on the Man of War
      for 2 or 3 Hours, and it is supposed did her considerable Damage, and probably killed and
      wounded some of the Men; but before they could board her, which they were preparing to do, the
      Tide arose about 8 o'Clock in the Evening, when she cut her Cable, and got off. Some of her
      Shot struck one or two Buildings in Beverly; but no Lives were lost on our Side, and the
      Privateer damaged very little if any. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Boston 12 October 1775</P>
   <P>From different Conversations I have had on the subject of navigating in the River <name>St Lawrence</name>
      at this time of the year, and on the probability of Vessels getting to Quebec, I have been led
      to take the Opinions of Captains [Broderick] Hartwell and [John] Macartney upon the likelihood
      of the Cerberus and Transports arriving at Quebec, supposing they were now ready to depart:
      these Gentlemen assure and authorize me to say, the Attempt is extremely dangerous and that to
      persevere after getting into the River will be fatal to the whole, and that they look upon the
      Scheme to be impracticable: the reasons they have given me are so forcible, that I am intirely
      of their Opinion, and think it not adviseable to attempt it. I am Sir &amp;c</P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Nautilus Boston Bay 12 Octr 1775</P>
   <P>The 10th instant saw standing into Salem a Schooner, the one I supposed I was in quest after,
      and followed her into a little Bay near to Beverley Bar, in which she run ashore, and I got in
      as near as possible just within Grape; after firing some Shot they left her, as she was
      aground and very near the beach thought it best to endeavour setting her on fire, immediately
      hoisted out the Boats, and got Combustibles ready for that purpose, but by this time she was
      quite dry, and render'd it impracticable, and I continued firing a Number of Shots into her,
      this Alarm brought great Numbers of armed people to different Stations of Security and a smart
      fire of Musquetry and Swivels took Place, soon after a fire from Salem Side with three Pieces
      of Cannon, at different Stations, so well chosen that I could not see them with my Glass; and
      at such a distance as to put it out of my power to return the Complement with that effect I
      could have wished, so that after exchanging Shot for some time to no purpose, not being able
      to destroy the Schooner, thought it time to get under way which could not be effected but by
      bringing a Spring on the Cable to cast her, as the Wind blew on the Bank to which I was very
      near, and obliged me to leave the Anchor; notwithstanding this precaution very soon after took
      the Ground, and, in this Situation received a great many Shot mostly in my Rigging and Sails,
      about 20 through the Hammacoes and Hull, one Gun dismounted, and a Swivel shot in two; one man
      has lost his Leg, and another wounded in the Side. 'tis very lucky they fired so high. I have
      sent in the Charming Polly Schooner with a foreign Cargo of Cocoa. 2 I am Sir &amp;c</P>

   <Title>LETTER FROM BRISTOL, RHODE ISLAND, TO A NEW YORK CORRESPONDENT </Title>
   <P>Dear Sir, Bristol, Oct. 12, 1775.</P>
   <P>Having observed in the last Newport Mercury, an imperfect account relative to the conduct of
      his Majesty's ships, under the command of Capt. Wallace at Bristol, last Saturday night
      [October 7]. I embrace this opportunity to give you a true and particular detail of facts,
      that took place, from their anchoring in the harbour till they left the town. - - - On
      Saturday the 7th instant, P.M. appeared in sight of this harbour, a very formidable fleet,
      consisting of 16 sail, viz. three men of war, one bomb ketch, and other armed vessels, all
      which, excepting the Glasgow (who ran ashore at Paquash point) drew up in a line of battle,
      from one end of the town to the other: soon after they had moored, a barge came from the Rose,
      to the head of a wharf, with the Lieutenant, who asking if there were any gentlemen on the
      wharf? <name>William Bradford</name> being present, answered yes; whereupon the Lieutenant informed him,
      Captain Wallace had a demand to make on the town, and desired that two or three of the
      principal men, or magistrates of the town, would go on board his ship, within an hour, and
      hear his proposals, otherwise hostilities would be commenced against the town. the above
      gentleman replied as a magistrate, that, in his opinion, Capt. Wallace was under a greater
      obligation to come ashore, and make his demands known to the town, than for the magistrates to
      go on board his ship to hear them, and added, that if Capt. Wallace would come to the head of
      the wharf the next morning, he should be treated as a gentleman, and the town would consider
      of his demands; with this answer the Lieutenant returned on board the Rose. The inhabitants
      being made acquainted with the above conversation, repaired to the wharf, and waited with the
      utmost impatience for a reply from Capt. Wallace, till an hour had expired, when the whole
      fleet began a most heavy cannonading, and the bomb vessel to bombard, and heave shells and
      carcases into the town; which continued without imtermission, an hour and an half.</P>
   <P>In the mean time Col. [Stephen] Potter, in the hottest of the fire, went upon the head of the
      wharf, hailed the Rose, went on board and requested a cessation of hostilities, 'till the
      inhabitants might choose a committee to go on board and treat with Capt. Wallace; which
      request was complied with; and six hours were allowed for the above purpose. Col. Potter
      returned and made a report to the Committee of inspection, who chose a select committee to
      hear Capt. Wallace's demands, which, after they had gone on board, Capt. Wallace informed them
      were a supply of 200 sheep and 30 fat cattle. This demand, the Committee replied, it was
      impossible to comply with; for the country people had come in and drove off their stock,
      saving a few sheep and some milch cows. </P>
   <P>After some hours had expired, during the negociation, without coming to any agreement, Captain
      Wallace told them, I have this one proposal to make, &quot;If you will promise to supply me
      with 40 sheep, at or before twelve o'clock, I will assure you that another gun shall not be
      discharged.&quot; The committee. seeing themselves reduced to the distressing alternative,
      either to supply their most inveterate enemy with provisions, or devote to the flames the
      town, with all the goods, besides near 100 sick persons, who could not be removed without the
      utmost hazard of their lives; I say, seeing themselves reduced to this dreadful dilemma, of
      two evils reluctantly chose the least, by agreeing to supply them with 40 sheep at the time
      appointed, which was punctually performed. </P>
   <P>The Rev. Mr. <name>John Burt</name> having been confined to his house by the camp distemper, when the
      cannonading began left his habitation, to seek some place of safety; and the next day was
      found dead in a neighbouring field. It is con jectured that being overcome with fear and
      fatigue, he fell down and was unable to raise himself up, and so expired. A child also of
      Capt. <name>Timothy Ingraham</name>, having been removed in the rain, died the next day. </P>
   <P>What equally challenges our administration and gratitude to God is, that no more lives were
      lost, or persons hurt, by such an incessant and hot fire; the streets being full of men, women
      and children, the whole time; the shrieks of the women, the cries of the children, and groans
      of the sick, would have extorted a tear from even the eye of a Nero. - But I forbear - words
      can't describe the dreadful scene. </P>
   <P>After the ships had received their supply, and stole about 90 cheeses, and some poultry, from
      Papaquash, they weighed anchor, and moored at Papaquash point; the next day (being Tuesday)
      they went into Bristol ferry way and fired a number of shot at the houses and people on each
      shore, where three of them got a ground; but the tide rising towards evening, they left us,
      and have not molested us since. </P>
   <P>A great number of dwelling-houses &amp;c. were shot through; but suffered very little damage.
      A cannon ball entered a distill-house, then passed through three hogsheads and barrels of rum,
      and spilt their contents. </P>
   <P>[Footnote added by editor of the New Yark Gazette] The Rev. Mr. Burt was born in Boston, and
      having received a liberal education at Harvard College, he was ordained pastor of the
      Congregational church in Bristol, where he laboured in the work of the ministry 34 years. He
      was a gentleman of a respectable character. </P>

   <P>Capt. <name>John Lawrence</name> being by request attending at the door, was called in and examined, and
      notes of his examination taken which were filed, and are in the words following, to wit: </P>
   <P>Capt. <name>John Lawrence</name> sailed from London the 2d of August; left Falmouth the 14th: says, he made
      it his business to get all the intelligence he could with respect to the intentions of
      Government against the Colonies. That 23 ships from 40 guns and under were fitting out for the
      American service, to relieve the ships which were deemed too large, which he understood were
      to be recalled. That they were not all to come out this fall on account of the carpenters
      leaving the yards; that he understood 5 regiments were to come from Ireland, 3 regiments from
      England and Scotland, and 5 companies of artillery; that a large quantity of ordnance was
      shipping for America, and that five transports with provisions were sailed for Boston before
      he sailed; that he understood the troops were destined for Boston; that he heard that 4 or 5
      of the transports had sailed for Ireland, to take the troops on board before he sailed; that
      he saw 4000 stand of arms shipped for Quebec; that 2 brigs sailed out of the Downs in company
      with him laden with warlike stores; that they sailed without convoy; that they had a
      lieutenant on board each but no troops; that he understood the arms were for the use of the
      Canadians; that he did not hear of any troops going to Quebec; that he did not hear of any
      artillery or stores or troops were to be sent to the southern Colonies, or to this Province;
      that he understood that 10,000 tons of transports were taken up to go to Embden, and 16,000
      Hessians and Hanoverians were intended for America; But whether they were to proceed
      immediately to America or touch in England was not certain; reports differing relative
      thereto. That the report of employing Hessians and Hanoverians took place before the account
      of <name>Bunker Hill</name> battle; that the people seemed to be much exasperated against the Americans on
      receiving the account of <name>Bunker Hill</name> that the merchants in general were opposed to the
      Americans; that they were much pleased on hearing that 15,000 of the provincials were killed
      and taken prisoners by about 1700 regulars; but when the true state of the battle arrived they
      made long faces; that he did not hear of their building any flat-bottomed boats; that the news
      of taking Ticonderoga, &amp;c. was by no means relished; that it was supposed the Parliament
      would be called sooner than usual, on account of calling the Hessian and Hanoverian troops;
      that Capt. <name>Effingham Lawrence</name> told him that he had been informed by Lord [Henry] Gage, that
      they intended to make up their army in America to 30,000 men this fall; that there was no
      complaint of the manufacturers wanting employ, and it was generally supposed that the
      administration kept them employed; that the people in general thought New-York worse than any
      of the other Colonies for disappointing them, not only by joining the other Colonies, but by
      acting more vigorously than the rest; that he heard there was more than ordinary demands for
      British goods by the Mediterranean; that the manufacturers in Ireland were quiet, but wished
      well to the Americans; that the people in England were anxious to hear from the Congress,
      expecting some offer of accomodation. That it was reported that on the news of <name>Bunker Hill</name>,
      the stocks fell a little, but afterwards rose again; that he heard of no disunion in the
      councils of administration; that great numbers of vessels were laid up in the Thames owing to
      the stopping of the American trade; that it was generally expected in England that the next
      news from America would be that Maj. [Philip] Skeene was hanged. </P>

      Colony as soon as she is refitted and fit for sea.</P>
   <P>A draft of a letter to the commissioners at the fortifications in the Highlands was read and
      filed, and is in the words following, to wit: </P>
   <P>In Provincial Congress, New-York, October 12th, 1775. </P>
   <P>Gentlemen -- The enclosed resolution which we received last evening from the Continental
      Congress will show you the objects they have in view, with regard to the fortifications now
      building in the Highlands, and also their sentiments as to the necessity of fortifying several
      other places on the river. We desire that you would take the matters recommended by the

   <P>Resolved, That Capt. <name>Thomas Moore</name> be appointed to the Command of the Boat Hancock. </P>
   <P>Agreeable to an Order of the Board, Directions for <name>Peter Long</name>, Gentleman, as Ship's Husband to

   <P>In Committee of Safety.</P>
   <P>To <name>Peter Long</name>,</P>
   <P>Gentleman: You are hereby appointed Ship's Husband to the Pennsylvania Fleet, and empower'd to
      do all such matters and things as may be necessary for the due Execution of the said Office. </P>
   <P>You are to make known to all Commanders &amp; other officers employed in the said Fleet, that
      they are to apply through you for all Stores and necessary's required for the Service. You are
      to receive their Indents or Lists of what is wanted, Report the same as often as necessary to
      this Committee, and when the approbation of the Board is obtained, You are to procure the
      sundry articles, of the best quality, each in its kind; and it is your particular Duty to buy
      them on the best terms in your power; You are to take each officers' receipt for the articles
      delivered to him, and you are to return the Bills or accounts of those you purchase for this
      Board, certify'd by you that the quantity's are what you received, and the prices what you
      agreed for, not being dearer than the Currant rates of each respective articles at the time of
      purchase. </P>
   <P>You are empower'd to inspect and inquire on board the Fleet at least once in every month, and
      as much oftener as you may think necessary, whether all Stores and necessary's are taken
      proper care off, and not negelected, wasted or embezzled, and make Report according, as you
      find to this Board. </P>
   <P>This Board, being ever desirous to serve the Public faithfully, so recommend the most prudent
      economy in the Outfits &amp; Supplys of the Fleet; they must have every thing necessary, but
      avoid all expensive Superfluitys, and in the purchase of what is wanted, give a preference to
      such persons as are known to be Zealous supporters of the American cause, deviding the
      business amongst as many of such as can be done with conveniency, and consistantly with the
      public good. </P>

   <P>I have inclosed a Paper upon which I will make no Remark: But leave you to your own
      Conjectures - only I must absolutely insist that it be mentioned to nobody. It may gratify
      your Curiosity and give some Relief to your Cares. 2 </P>
   <P>I most earnestly pray that all my Friends would exert themselves to furnish me with
      Intelligence of a particular Nature. I mean with a List of all the Depradations committed upon
      our Trade; a List of all the Vessels which have been taken by the Cutters, Cruizers, &amp;c. ;
      the Names of the Vessells, Masters, owners; Burthen of the Ship, the Nature of the Cargo's,
      and the Value of both. Nothing will contribute so much to facilitate Reprizals, as an exact
      Account of our Losses and Damages. I wish our General Court would take it up and examine it
      thoroughly. </P>

   <P>2. Outline of Proposal for Procuring Powder. See next entry. </P>
   <Title>OUTLINE OF PROPOSAL FOR PROCURING PowDER 1</Title>
   <P>[Philadelphia, October 12]</P>
   <P>As the Article of Powder is much wanted to carry on the operations vs. the Ministerial Army,
      and as the british Ministry have taken Every Step that human Nature could devise to prevent
      the Americans obtaining so essential an Article; it is humbly Submitted to the wisdom of the
      Cont. Congress, whether it will not be prudent to Supply themselves with that Article at the
      Expence of the said Ministry by taking it wherever they can get it. It is therefore
      recommended that 2 Vessells properly mann'd be sent to the Island of Antigua one of which may
      anchor at old Road on the South Side of the said Island (where there are only a few Houses) in
      the Evening under Dutch Colours; passing for a Vessell bound on a forced Trade, to the French
      Islands; in the night they may land, and take away all the powder; there being not above one
      or two Persons, in the fort to prevent it. As soon as the Powder is obtained the Vessell may
      proceed down to Johnsons Point Fort, at the S.W. point of the Island; and take what is there;
      there being only a single Matross in the said Fort; the other Vessell must be commanded by a
      prudent Man, well acquainted with the Bar and Harbour at <name>St. Johns</name>; if any Man of War be
      anchored without the Bar; it will not be prudent to attempt any Thing, but should there be
      none; the Vessell may then go over the Bar, and anchor close under the fort; as is commonly
      the Custom. There are generally 10 or 12 Soldiers in James Fort Situated on a Point on the
      larboard Hand, Seven miles distant from the Town; the Magazine is in a hollow; on the Left
      hand just after entering the Gate, and commonly contains from 500 to 1000 Blls. of Powder, or
      more. 2 miles from thence to the northward is a Small fort called Corbresons point fort; and 2
      miles from this northward is another Small fort called Dickensons bay fort, in either of which
      there is not above a Single Matross. All this Powder may be easily obtained without any
      Opposition, if conducted with Prudence; it will be necessary that the Captn should have some
      Money, to distribute among the Soldiers, to assist in taking it away; He may go into the Fort
      in the afternoon (and See how the Land lies) under pretence of Sailing that night, and thereby
      guide his operation.</P>
   <P>The same Thing may be done by other Vessells at Montserrat, Nevis, Charles fort at Sandy
      point, St: Kitts, also at St. Martens; without any Risque.</P>
   <P>I would advise the continental Congress to make a general Sweep of all the Powder, at St.
      Eustatius, it may first be taken and then paid for afterwards as the Dutch refuse to sell it
      to us; I am well persuaded the whole of this Plan may be executed, and that near 3000 Blls of
      powder may be obtained in the Course of 3 or 4 months. </P>

   <P>Dear General,</P>
   <P>Camp near St.Johns Octr. 13th</P>
   <P>Some Time ago I informed you of my Intentions to make my approaches on the West Side, as soon
      as the expected Reinforcement enabled me to undertake it. I had had a Road cut to the intended
      Ground &amp; some Fascines made when I was informed by Major Brown that a general
      Dissatisfaction prevailed, that unless something was undertaken in a few Days there would be a
      Meeting, &amp; that the universal Sense of the Army was to direct all our Intentions to the
      East Side. The Impatience of the Troops to get Home has prevented their seeing the
      Impossibility of undertaking this Business sooner, the Duty being hard for the Troops even on
      the present confined State of Operations.</P>
   <P>When I mentioned my Intentions I did not consider I was at the Head of Troops who carry the
      Spirit of Freedom into the Field &amp; think for themselves.</P>
   <P>Upon considering the fatal Consequences which might flow from a Want of Subordination &amp;
      Discipline should this ill Humour continue my unstable Authority over Troops of different
      Colonies, the Insufficiency of the military Law, &amp; my own Want of Power to enforce it,
      weak as it is, I thought it expedient to call the Field officers together. Enclosed I have
      sent you the Result of our Deliberations.</P>
   <P>I still suspect the Garrison intend an Elopement, and there is some Reason to think they are
      getting Flat Boats ready to go down the Rapids. This Intelligence is just come.</P>
   <P>The Canadians who have befriended us begin to be exceedingly uneasy at their Situation should
      we not succeed. I have ventured to assure them, should any Accident oblige us to retire
      without effecting our Business, that I would take Care of all those who were afraid to remain
      in the Country.</P>
   <P>You will see the Propriety of putting Tionderoga in a State of Defence against a Winter Coup
      de Main, which in my Opinion will be best effected by a Stockade, and also of having a Post at
      Crown Point. The Vessels should lie in Stockade also, the Garrison be well provided with
      Vegetables and every Thing necessary to make them comfortable; otherwise it will be difficult
      to keep them there; And such Preparation made for a naval Armament in the Spring that the
      Troops may move down to the Isle Aux Noix before Mr Carleton has Time to establish himself
      there should those unhappy Troubles continue. I am &amp;c.</P>

   <Title>BRIGADIER GENERAL R1cHARD MoNTGOMERY's REPORT OF his CoNFERENCE WITH HIS OFFICERS 1 </Title>
   <P>I proposed establishing a battery of all our spare heavy Cannon on the rising ground exactly
      opposite the Stone house in the North redoubt, - (in the West face of which there is but one
      embrazure open) at the distance of about 100 yards, Securing this battery with a work Capable
      of being well defended by 200 Men. From this battery our approaches might be continued to the
      ditch, &amp; by the time we arrive there, the fraze round the berm would be destroyed, the
      rampart in a ruinous state, &amp; the large house (which is said to be their principal
      barrack) would be destroyed, as every Shot that missed the rampart must take the house. Two
      four pounders on the East Side would answer the end of seeing the west rampart in reverse,
      &amp; thereby slackening the opposition of the enemy. By this mode of proceeding, if our
      ammunition held out, there would be in my opinion some prospect of success, notwithstanding
      the superior artillery of the Garrison, which could not be mounted in its proper place time
      enough to prevent the erection of our battery. The field Officers were to a man of opinion
      that my reasons were insufficient, being afraid the design'd ground was at this season too wet
      for approaches, &amp; Strongly of opinion our heavy cannon on the east side would more
      effectually distress the enemy by annoying their buildings, the Fort having a Gentle slope to
      the river &amp; which was urged as the strongest motive by destroying their Schooner. In vain
      I represented if every building was destroy'd, the garrison could not surrender without a
      probability of an assault, which could never arise from any attack on the opposite side of the
      river that the vessel could not be destroyed, because she would change her place in such a
      manner as to elude our batteries that we had little powder or time to throw away on
      experiments that I had a moral certainty they would find themselves mistaken &amp; finally
      that they must take it upon themselves; for I would not oppose the general sence of the army,
      &amp; should enforce the measure by every effort in my power. </P>
   <P>I cannot help observing to how little purpose I am here. Were I not afraid the example would
      be too generally followed &amp; that the publick service might suffer, I would not stay an
      hour at the head of Troops whose operations I cannot direct - I must say I have no hopes of
      Success from the garrisons wanting provisions.</P>

   <P>May it please your Excellency </P>
   <P>A person going down the River presents the first Opportunity I ha_ve had of writing to your
      Excellency, since I left Fort Western, since which we have had a very fatigueing time, the Men
      in general not understanding Batteaus have been obliged to wade &amp; haul them more than half
      way up the River - the last Division is just arrived - three Divisions are over the first
      Carrying place, &amp; as the Men are in high Spirits, I make no doubt of reaching the River
      Chaudiere in Eight or Ten Days, the greatest difficulty being I hope already past. </P>
   <P>We have now with us about twenty five days provisions for the whole Detachment, Consisting of
      about Nine hundred &amp; fifty effective men. I intend making an exact return, but must defer
      it untill I come to Chaudiere - I have order'd the Commissary to hire people acquainted with
      the River &amp; forward on the Provisions left behind (about 100 barrells) to the great
      Carrying place, to secure our retreat the expence will be Considerable, but when set in
      Competition with the Lives or Liberties of so many brave men, I think it trifling, &amp; if we
      Succeed, the Provisions will not be lost. </P>
   <P>I have had no intelligence from Genl [Philip] Schuyler or Canada, &amp; expect none 'till I
      reach Chaudiere Pond, where I expect a Return of my Express, &amp; to determine my plan of
      operation which as it is to be govern'd by Circumstances, I can say no more than if we are
      oblig'd to return I believe we shall have a sufficiency of provisions to reach this place
      where the Supply order'd the Commissary to send forward, will enable us to return on our way
      home so far that your Excellencv will be able to relieve us, if we proceed on we shall have a
      sufficient Stock to reach the French Inhabitants (where we can be supplied) if not Quebec-</P>
   <P>Your Excellency may possibly think we have been tardy in our march, as we have gained so
      Little, but when you Consider the badness &amp; weight of the Batteaus, and large quantity's
      of Provisions &amp;c. we have been obliged to force up against a very rapid Stream, where you
      would have taken the men for Amphibious Animals, as they were a great part of the time under
      water, add to this the great Fatigue in Portage - you will think I have pushed the men as fast
      as they could possibly bear, the Officers, Volunteers &amp; Privates in General, have Acted
      with the greatest Spirit &amp; Industry. I am-[&amp;c.] </P>

      they woud deliver to my care 1200 barrells of the flour, and let me know what woud be done,
      with the rest of the Cargo, when they received an Answer to a Letter they had wrote to your
      Excellency, in which (they inform me) they express the great want of that article in this
      province - As even a half a Loaf woud be better than no bread I told them I woud take
      immediate charge thereof, and yesterday I engaged two sloops, to begin the transportation, one
      of them will take in, this day.</P>
   <P>I have engaged in behalf of the Continent to insure (against the enemy only) the Vessels, the
      Committee will appraise them, they are to receive one shilling Lawfull money p barrell, which
      at this season of the year is not extravagant, - I find by haveing had a few barrells weighed,
      they fall short 3 .. 4 .. &amp; 5 pounds, of the weight Marked on them, &amp; as it will
      probably become a Continental Charge, I have thought it best to have them all weighed, that
      the publick, or the Commisary into whose hands they fall, may not pay for more flour than they
      realy have</P>
   <P>As there are people in this town inimicall to the Cause, I think best (in part) to keep it

   <P>In consequence of your Letter which I had the Honor to receive last night, respecting the
      dangers that would attend the Cerberus and Transports attempting the Navigation of the River
      <name>St Lawrence</name> at this late Season of the year, and giving such forcible Reasons for declaring
      the Measures proposed neither adviseable nor practicable, I have dropped the Idea of sending
      the Reinforcement to Quebec in that manner, and shall now endeavour to procure smaller
      Ves.5els for the reception of the Troops which are thought better calculated for the Service
      required. </P>
   <P>My Success in this point is at present doubtful, but if it can be accomplished, I will do
      myself the Honor to confer with you further on the Subject, and am with great Regard and

   <P>I take the Opportunity of a Schooner going to Quebec to acknowledge the Receipt of your
      Excellency's Letter of the 6th of September. General Howe has communicated to me his desire
      forthwith to send some Regiments to Quebec, and I had appointed the Cerberus to convoy the
      Transports thither, who would have sailed perhaps within a Week, but the Captains of the
      Squadron acquainted with the River <name>St Lawrence</name> are positive in declaring the Attempt is
      exceedingly dangerous, and that there is not the least probability of the Man of War and
      Transports getting to Quebec this Fall. General Howe is therefore endeavouring to get small
      Vessels in which I shall chearfully and readily assist.</P>
   <P>Mr. [Robert] Duff at Newfoundland communicated to me your Application to him for Men. I am
      concerned it is not in either of our Powers to assist at a time that the King's Service under
      your Excellency's Care appears to require every possible Aid from all his Majesty's
      Servants</P>
   <P>I hope the Hunter Sloop, small as she is, will arrive in time and prove of some Service to you
      this Winter, and that the Lizard with the Transport from England will get up without any
      Accident. I am &amp;c</P>

   <P>Captain Collins of the Nautilus acquainted the Admiral that on the 10th instant he had chased
      and driven a Schooner on Shore near Beverly Bar and intended to set her on fire, but that
      while preparation was making for that purpose the tide left her, that he continued firing at
      her until great numbers of armed people came to her assistance, when he thought it best to
      leave her; that the Nautilus by casting the wrong way, obliged him to leave an Anchor behind,
      yet not without getting aground, and in that Situation receiving a number of Shot through her
      Hull Sails and Rigging and having two men wounded besides other Damage: That his Carpenter
      suspecting the head of his Main Mast to be sprung, he desired the Admiral would allow him time
      to lift his Rigging and examine all the Masts, which he had not an Opportunity of doing since
      he left England: and that he had met and convoyed in a Vessel with live Cattle and Carcases of
      Beef from Halifax for the Ships at Boston.</P>

      Passamaquody; and the latter informing of the Foweys arrival at Halifax, whose Masts were

   <P>Last Monday [October 9] was brought in here by an armed Schooner in the service of this
      Colony, a large ship - [William] Barron, Master,1 which she met with near Stonington. The Ship
      had on board 8000 bushels of wheat, which she took in at Baltimore, and cleared out from New
      York for Falmouth in England, but on the 10th of September, in Lat. 38, Long 65 met with a
      Gale of Wind, in which she was overset and lost her Main mast; after which, it is supposed she
      intended for Newport, but meeting with head Winds, they put into Stonington. She is owned by
      <name>Christopher Champ</name>[li]n, in Newport, and is said to be the same Vessel and Master which some
      months since cleared from Baltimore for Ireland, with a Load of Flour, and was taken by some
      of the King's Ships on this Station, and carried into Newport. She is gone, with her Cargo, to

   <Title>&quot;NAUTICUS&quot; TO PENNSYLVANIA COMMITTEE OF SAFETY 1</Title>
   <P>Gentlemen,</P>
   <P>Philadelphia, the 13th of Oct, 1775.</P>
   <P>This informs you of a method I have considered of to defend this City against any Vessels that
      may come up this River with an intent to do it damage; whether my proposals may be of any
      advantage, I will not presume to say, I leave that to your superior knowledge, And to whose
      Province it alone belongs; However, as an American, I think it my duty to contribute to
      promote the American cause as far as my abilities extends against its Enemies. </P>
   <P>First. </P>
   <P>The narrowness of the River and the rapid tide, Is a great advantage to the Steering fire
      Vessels on board the Enemy, By which means they may be burnt or Terrified in such a manner as
      to occasion them to quit the River. There is nothing can be thought of that will be of so much
      Service as fire Vessels rightly mannaged. </P>
   <P>Secondly. </P>
   <P>The method of fitting them for that purpose should be consulted by those who have a knowledge
      of fire works, which is to be filled with such Combustables as to make a furious,
      Instantaneous flame, And also to have some solider fuel, which when fired, will continue the
      Fire furiously. </P>
   <P>Thirdly. </P>
   <P>This should be done in such manner, that the fire Vessel should not be turned a Drift, which I
      think may be Effected by an Iron fixed on the stem of the fire Vessel, with a sharp point
      ragged, and to give the fire Vessel such way through the water as to be sufficient to peirce
      or enter the side of the Ship so far as not to draw, and to have it made to break short off by
      the force of the Tide, and then with a Chain, one end fas(to the part in the Ship, and the
      other end fast in the eye-bolt fixed in a proper place in the fire Vessel, will bring her up
      alongside with a force, that will drive sharp points ragged into the Ship, and the fire Vessel
      will be fast fore and aft, in such a manner as the Enemy will be at a loss to find out, as all
      this may be fixed under water where they cannot see, which will put the Enemy in Great
      confusion; (Lett the Ships be Large or small they will all burn.) I shall employ my thoughts
      on what may be of further Advantage if this is worth your notice; and experiment of the above
      Scheme may be seen and properly demonstrated for a small expence. I am, Gentlemen, your most
      humble Servant, </P>
   <P>Nauticus </P>
   <P>There is other ways of making use of fire masheins, but what I have now given an account of
      will be ,the least suspected of any, and is most likely to answer the purpose. </P>

   <P>If We should invite &quot;all the Maritime Powers of the World into our Ports,&quot; would any
      one of them come? At least, untill they should be convinced that We are able, and determined
      to fight it out with G.B. to the last? Are they yet convinced of this, or will they be very
      soon? Besides, if they should, Would it be Sound Policy in Us to admit them? Would it not be
      sounder to confine the Benefit and the Bargain to one or a few?</P>
   <P>Is it not wiser to send our own Ships to all maritime Powers, and admit private adventurers

   <Title>MACHIAS COMMITTEE OF SAFETY TO THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL COURT 1</Title>
   <P>Gentlemen,</P>
   <P>During the absence of Captn [Jeremiah] Obrien, the Committee of this place commissioned Captn
      <name>Stephen Smith</name> to take Charge of the Private-teer, &amp; bring in here the Brigg Loyal Briton
      owned by <name>Messrs Archibald Wilson</name>, <name>James Anderson</name>, <name>John Greenlaw</name>, <name>David Black</name> and <name>John Semple</name>
      who had sent her to <name>St John</name>'s River in <name>Nova Scotia</name> to load with Cattle &amp;c. for the Army at
      Boston; &amp; upon Captn Smiths Arrival there, he found the said Brigg loaded &amp; weighing
      Anchor. He thereupon took Immediate possession of her, without opposition and after taking the
      provision found in the Fort, burning the Fort, and taking a Copora1 &amp; two Privates, with
      two women &amp; five Children he proceeded with his Prize &amp; Prisoners, (Mr <name>John Semple</name> of
      Boston and <name>David Ross</name> the mate excepted, who found means to Escape), directly to this Place.
      An exact Inventory of the Goods taken in the Brigg and in the Fort we send enclosed. The
      Cattle, sheep, Hogs, smoked Salmon &amp; Butter; we have divided among the people, who took
      them, except one third part reserved in the Hands of the Committee for publick use: The other
      things are all Stored, &amp; await the orders of the General Court. The two private Soldiers,
      with their wives &amp; Children, at their earnest request, we have sent back to <name>St Johns</name>,
      taking it for granted that they would be not only useless, but expensive lumber in the western
      parts of this Colony: <name>William Miller</name> the Pilot of the Brigg and three seamen are permitted to
      ship on board the Privateteer, and Captn Fredireck Sterling only, the Master of the Brigg, and
      the Corporal above-mentioned are sent to Court. Captn Sterling has much to say for himself,
      but his conduct is not altogether unexceptionable: All we can. say is, that he is a
      North-Briton. We have given him part of his private venture, &amp; reserve the rest 'till the
      pleasure of the General Court is known. </P>
   <P><name>John Anderson Esqr</name> was also on board the Brigg, as a passenger who was dismissed &amp;
      suffered to return to his own Home, not because he appeared to be a cordial friend to the
      Cause, in which we have embarked our all, but because he belonged to another Province. Nothing
      material has since happened, for we can do but little. We now beg leave to return your honors
      our Humble &amp; hearty thanks for the many favors already confered upon us, of which we shall
      ever retain the most grateful remembrance. It would give us the highest satisfaction to find
      ourselves able, thro' the Aid you have graciously given us, both in the Land &amp; sea
      Service, to protect &amp; support ourselves, without giving your Honors any further trouble:
      But such are our Necessitous circumstances, thro' the almost total failure of our commerce,
      upon which we have hitherto subsisted &amp; by which we have rose to such magnitude, as to be
      in some measure worthy of your Honors attention, the Admtration of this Vast Continent and the
      dread of Halifax, and the brittish Navy, that we have no other alternative, but Either to
      &quot;sink&quot; - or to make a most humble and dutiful application to our avowed, beloved,
      &amp; beneficent Guardians. We are therefore under the disagreeable necessity of adding: That
      we have drawn a bill upon your Honors in favor of Mr Wm Shey of Philadelphia for a Cargo of
      provisions, a Copy of which, together with the Letter of advice given with it; we send
      enclosed. We could not but View the arrival of this cargo of provision as a very remarkable
      interposition of Divine Providence, in our behalf, &amp; thought our. selves indispensably
      bound to treat the benevolent Instrument by which it came, with honor, But purchase we could
      not, Lumber would not answer, and all the Cash we could collect in the whole place was but
      barely sufficient to pay the freight. To suffer this provision to depart from us, &amp; go
      elsewhere, would have been the heighth of distraction, as we were then in want, and armed
      Plunderers infested all our coasts, and picked up all the provision they could find; and
      especially when we add, we had no prospect of either Quails or Manna. The sacred laws of
      self-preservation, therefore, deserved respect to Mr Shey, the tender obligations, that
      subsist between the Guardian &amp; his beneficiary, &amp; the Mutual affection of Indulgent
      parents &amp; dutiful Children, all conspired to Justify; &amp; even recommend a draught upon
      the General Court of the Colony. The bill is drawn, &amp; a copy of it now lies before you. If
      it is duly honored, our Mills, our boards, our Shingles &amp;c our houses and not to Mention
      the sloop M echias Liberty, sloop Unity, the Margeretta, Diligent, Tatamagouch, or the Infidel
      reclaimed (once Loyal Briton) our all is yours, 'till the whole is repaid. This may soon be
      done, for we are both able &amp; willing to pay the whole amount of said Bill in lumber, on
      Demand. If this bill is not Honored, we tremble at the consequence! </P>
   <P>On this occassion we send Mr <name>George Stillman</name>, as our Representative, who was chosen by the
      Town for that purpose: And with him we send the Accounts of our expence, in burying the Dead,
      who fell in the day of battle, or died of the wounds they then received, in taking care of the
      wounded, &amp; in supporting the prisoners &amp; conveying them to Head Quarters, except the
      <name>Doctrs Bill</name>, &amp; the persons who attended him, which we choose they should present
      themselves. The charges of those persons, who were lately at the General Court, &amp; Mr
      <name>Stephen Jones</name>'s we have sent as they brought them in to us. But all the rest we have examined,
      and Approved. We are heartily grieved to see our expences run so high, but we see no way to
      reduce them any lower without doing apparent injustice. We have other enormous expences among
      ourselves which we never mean to mention in the ears of Government, for the greater part of us
      have spent almost our whole time in public service Since the taking of the first Tender. We
      are but an handful &amp; every publick exertion required the most of our strength. And were
      your Honors graciously to add, to your parental bounty in the land &amp; Sea Service of this
      place, which we esteem a rich &amp; signal favor, all the Prizes we have taken, we should
      still be sufferers. - we ask not a farthing more than we have merited; we expect, we are
      willing, to suffer with our brethren, for it is honorable &amp; Glorious to suffer in this
      Cause. Your Honors are well Acquainted with our infant state, with our critical situation,
      &amp; with all we have done in support of the invaluable priviledges of America, &amp; Great
      Britain, and we rest assured that you will not permit us to suffer beyond Measure. . . . </P>
   <P>We also beg leave to recommend to your Honors Notice the Widow McNiel &amp; her orphan
      children who are left under very poor circumstances. Mr <name>John Berry</name> who has a family Ebenezar
      Beal of Old York, an old Man &amp; <name>Isaac Taft</name> &amp; <name>James Cole</name>, young men, may not be,
      perhaps, unworthy of Notice. These were all badly wounded, and it is doubtful whether they
      will ever be capable of business, as they were before, or not. The last mentioned is still
      confined. Before we conclude, we must observe, that on the 8th Instant Eleven Deserters from
      the Somerset at Halifax arrived here, who informed us that the Tartar &amp; two Sloops of war
      are now up the Bay of Funday, &amp; that a Schooner of 14 Carriage Guns &amp; 50 men, was
      fitting out at Halifax in order to Join two other Tenders, and proceed directly against this
      place. - Eight of the said deserters are inlisted on board the Sloop Machias Liberty. Should
      Armed Vessels come against us we should be in danger of falling a sacrifice, for we are very
      Scant of Powder; as almost all that was taken in the Diligent was destroy'd, Some body poured
      water into it privately. We earnestly beg therefore, that your Honors would please to send us
      more. </P>
   <P>We are Gentlemen most respectfully your most Dutiful &amp; Humble Servants By order of the

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>I am honor'd with yours of the 12th 17th Ulto &amp;ca by the Viper and Bolton who arrived here
      the 4th Inst with two Transports, a small Schooner for Virginia, and a Packet for York - The
      Viper, Schooner and Packet Sai'led immediately for New York. I engaged the quantity of Stock
      necessary for the Transports and began taking it on board when intelligence flew thro' the
      Country. - Expresses sent off for the Rebel Camp. - The Rebel Governor Cooke of Providence
      raised the Country sent down 1500 Men to Newport to prevent us, However I got all that could
      be got notwithstanding their utmost efforts, And shall send the Transports loaded. - The
      Rebels stole into the Town in the Night and next Morning sent a party down to Brentons Neck
      where we had been taking off Stock, and what we left such as Milch Cows for the use of the
      Family, they took all away, not leaving a Chicken for the Women. </P>
   <P>I sent to the Town and acquainted them they must get the Rebels away, or otherwise it would
      become my Duty to destroy them and the Town, they gave me the strongest Assurances they should
      leave the Town and actually did leave it after staying one Night and part of the next day, And
      quartered themselves two Miles distant, in this Instance it would have been hard upon the Town
      to have destroyed it, because it seemed that many of them could not help the Irruption of such
      a Banditti. Such numbers being sent from Camp and Country round about, and ta'lking of making
      Newport a place of Arms by Fortifying it, and pretending to have brought 17 Pieces of Cannon
      from Camp, for that purpose, in Order to divert their attention, I got under Weigh with His
      Majesty's Ships, and stood up towards Bristol, came to an Anchor against it a little after 6
      PM sent an Officer to Summon it to know if they would send any body to treat, gave them an
      hour to consider, and if they sent no answer in that time to Commence Hostilities, they
      Slighted our Summons, they returned no answer! this, together with their behaviour about a
      Month before (Bargaining for a quantity of Cattle of a Farmer opposite the Town, the people of
      the Town rose and drove away all my Cattle) determined me to fire upon them. At 8 oClock we
      begun, at 10 a Mr Potter came on board to Treat, he did not seem to have full powers, so
      desired some may be sent off that had, I asked them why they did not answer my Summons, that
      my intentions was friendly, that I only came to purchase Stock for the King's forces. - Had
      they given me fair Answers not a Gun would have been fired, however, since it was as it was, I
      demanded a quantity of Stock for the use of His Majesty, which I would pay for, - They
      hesitated and prevaricated much, said the Country people had drove it all off - I told them
      that would not do - they then told me they could get about 50 Sheep. - the Country being at
      this time greatly alarmed, Rebels flocking in from all quarters, - My intent being answer'd
      diverting them from making a place of Arms of Newport, - Accepted of the 50 Sheep and got them
      onboard. During this transaction the Rebels fired several Shot at us In the Evening weighed
      and came to Sail, Anchored off Hogg Island, Next morning Ordered the Swan and two Tenders in
      to destroy Bristol Ferries, they made a Signal for a large Body of Rebels being there, stood
      in and fired a few Shot at them. One of our Tenders got aground, continued plying off and on,
      as we Tack'd being close in upon the Shore, the Swan ran aboard of us carried away our Jibboom
      and hurt the knee of the head we let go the Anchor, parted the Cable and run ashore, while we
      were in this situation we exchanged several Shot with the Rebels, The Water rising we got off
      after being two hours ashore, without any damage (we have now only three Cables in the Ship.)
      Weighed and Stood to some of the other Islands, Compleated the Transports and returned to
      Newport. Upon my Arrival several Gentlemen of the Town waited upon me, from the Town,
      acquainting me if I would spare the Town, and suffer the Ferry Boats and Markets to come to
      Town, they would engage to get the Rebels off the Island and Supply His Majesty's Ships with
      what they wanted, I answered it would be impossible to be at Peace while such a Body of Rebels
      hung over the Town if they would remove them off the Island and Supply the Kings Ships, I
      would consent to what they proposed 'till further Orders. This appears to me to be for the
      Kings Service and I am yet of Opinion it may be made a Post for the King. </P>
   <P>Most of the Wood used here comes from Long Island we take Vessels loaded, that's precarious,
      two or three Companies of Men as guards, while others cut, may get much. Rebel Vessels broke
      up will make more - In regard to Provisions, there's plenty to be got but it requires some
      force to protect while others get it, there's not an Island about here that has not 2 or 300
      Men under Arms to defend the Stock, and they are very vigilant, some of them have Marched 50
      Miles upon an Alarm. </P>
   <P>A Deputation from the Town informs me the Officer commanding the Rebel Party that is about two
      Miles from the Town, demurs upon leaving the Island but promises not to come near the Town - I
      still insist upon their leaving the Island, - in consequence they have sent off to the Rebel
      Head Quarters to insist upon their being removed, and I am flattered if that should be
      refused, there's a number of them will take Arms to join any force may be sent to drive them
      off. They see~ to think it hard they should be drove to draw the resentment of the whole
      Continent upon them, when there is none to give them Assistance. - however there is so much
      deceit in this Country and of which you are well acquainted that I need say no more upon that
      Subject. </P>
   <P>You will see by the State and Condition of His Majesty's Ships the situation we are in for

   <P><name>Ticonderoga Octr</name> 14th 1775</P>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>I had just closed my Letter of yesterday when I had the Honor to receive Yours of the 9th
      enclosing the Resolution of Congress of the 14th Septr, and the alarming Intelligence
      contained in Yours of the 7th 2 - You may recollect Sir, that early after the Meeting of
      Congress I urged the Necessity of Securing Hudson's River, &amp; assigned my Reasons for It. -
      3</P>
   <P>I have been &amp; still am so deeply impressed with the Necessity of doing it, that I saw with
      Chagrin, that It has been so long neglected; and I learnt with Pleasure, that a Fortification
      was at last began at Martlers Rock, but that is not the only Place, that ought to be secured,
      there are several Others both above and below, that ought equally to claim Attention, and
      immediately too, for should a Body of Forces be sent up Hudsons River and a Chain of Vessels
      stationed in all its Extent, It will undoubtedly greatly distress, if not totally ruin our
      Cause; The Indians Notwithstanding their Declarations will, in such a Case, in all Probability
      act against us. - the disaffected to our Cause will gain Strength, And many others thro' fear
      and the Principle of Self preservation, will either be neuter or join our foes, - to me Sir
      Every Object, as to Importance, sinks almost to Nothing, when put in Competition with this of
      securing Hudson's River. -</P>
   <P>I hope Congress will pardon the Freedom with which I express Myself on this Occasion, The
      Danger of such an Operation on the Part of the Ministry is painted in such lively Colours on
      my Mind, That I could not avoid saying what I have done ...</P>
   <P>I have not heard a Word from <name>St Johns</name> since mine of yesterday, I am still in Hopes all will go
      well there, unless a Want of Ammunition takes Place. The New York Congress have wrote to
      Connecticut What the Result of their Application is, I do not yet know.</P>
   <P>I should be extreamly happy if your good Wishes (on which I return You the most unfeigned
      Thanks) for the Restoration of my Health were realized, but unfortunately for me, I am so
      daily weakening by a Violent Lax &amp; extreme Sweatings at Night, that I shall think it
      necessary to send for Dr [Samuel] Stringer to me, because I neither can (Consistent with the
      Public Weal) nor will I quit this Place to go Southward until our Affairs in Canada are
      decided. -</P>
   <P>General Wooster having ordered a Court Martial at <name>Fort George</name> (of which I was informed only
      this Morning), which he by no Means had a Right to do, and apprehensive from that
      Extraordinary Conduct, that he might create Difficulties, If he should join the Army under
      General Montgomery (from which I cannot dissuade him, nor dare I order him tostay least the
      Regiment should refuse to go, which he says they would do), I thought it my Indispensable Duty
      to write him a Letter of which the inclosed is a Copy, and to which I received an Answer, Copy
      of which you have also inclosed. - I have since received Letters adviseing me that he has
      presumed to discharge Men of [Benjamin] Hinman's &amp; [David] Waterbery's Regiments. I assure
      you Sir, that I feel these Insults from a General Officer with all that keen Sensibility that
      a Man of Honor ought, and I should be ashamed to mention them to Congress, But that the
      Critical Situation of our public Affairs at this Period require that I should sacrafice a just
      Resentment to them. - And I would wish to have it remembered that to that Cause only must be
      imputed That I have suffered a Personal Indignity to go unpunished. I am Sir [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Instantly upon the Receipt of your Excellency's Commands, signified by your Letter of
      Yesterday, I called the Magistrates and Assistants to a Common Council, upon its important
      Contents. The Members of the Corporation unanimously expressed themselves upon this Occasion
      in Terms of the strongest Affection and Confidence, respecting their Governor; and I am
      persuaded, Sir, that their Fellow Citizens (for I consulted as many Individuals without Doors,
      as the Time would permit) are utterly disinclined to your Removal from the Capital of your
      Province.</P>
   <P>The City Committee, which is a very numerous Body of reputable Inhabitants, elected at a
      Convention of the whole Town, before your last Arrival, were immediately convened, upon my
      acquainting the Chairman with your Excellency's letter, and in a very little Time I had their
      Sentiments in Writing, under the Signature of their Chairman, which I now communicate, as a
      Confirmation of what it gives me the greatest Pleasure to declare, that the Citizens confiding
      in your friendship to a Colony which you have governed, with so much Reputation, earnestly
      desire you will still continue your Residence among us; and from the declaration and Temper of
      the People at large, I have not the least doubt of your enjoying the most ample

   <P>A Gentleman who signs &quot;Nauticus,&quot; produced to this Board a plan of a Fire Ship for
      the destruction of Enemy's Ships, which was approved of, And Mr. [Andrew] Allen desired to
      Return the thanks of this Board to the author for his plan. 2</P>
   <P>Upon Motion, Colo. [Daniel] Roberdeau was desired by the Board to wait on the Managers of the
      Pennsylvania Hospital, and request from them the use of that Charity for the Wounded or Sick
      Men employed in the Armed Boats, and for information from them how long they might depend on
      that benefit, and on what terms.</P>
   <P>Colo. Roberdeau having waited on the Managers of the Hospital Reports, That those Gentlemen
      very generously and readily agree to receive all Patients from the Public service, That may be
      recommended by this Board, and that they require no pay; but mentioned, That in Venereal
      Cases, it is usual for the Patient to pay three Pounds ten Shillings for his Cure.</P>
   <P>Upon motion, Resolved, That the thanks of this Board be convey'd by Colo. Roberdeau to the

      who, after calling a court-martial, and giving him a fair trial (as they were pleased to term
      it) passed sentence upon him to receive thirty nine lashes, which would have been executed,
      had not his Excellency the Governor, on being acquainted with this base and unmanly conduct,
      interposed, who severely reprimanded the tyrant Montague, sent the man ashore, and desired he
      would take out a peace warrant against him. </P>

   <P>Since we have had cannon mounted and colours hoisted on this fortification, we thought it
      necessary for every vessel passing by in the daytime, instead of sending their boat on shore,
      to hale them to lower the peak of their mainsail, as a token of their being friendly. We are
      now to acquaint you, that one Captain <name>Robert North</name>, passing by on this day, was hailed to
      lower his peak, which he refused to do. On being threatened with a shot, he replied, that was
      what he wanted; on this we sent an armed boat on board of him to bring him too, in order to
      Enquire his reason for refusing to do the same which he that instant saw another sloop to do;
      on our boats boarding of him, he told the people therein that he had a brace of pistols, and
      if that damned rascal (Capt. Bayard) did not produce an order to him from the Provincial
      Congress for the request we made, he would blow his brains out, with many more unfriendly
      expressions. We beg, sir, you will lay the above before the Honourable Provincial Congress,

   <P>The Congress have also appointed a Secret Committee for Supplying the Continent with certain
      Necessary Articles; of this I am one, and wish I could see you, or some other of my
      Connecticut Mercantile Friends, here, as it would be in my power, to help them, &amp; in
      theirs to serve their Country, this [is] all I can give, on this head, &amp; if you will come
      down, the Sooner, the better. A Naval Force, is a Favorite object of mine, &amp; I have a
      prospect now, of carrying that point, having succeeded in getting Our Connecticut, &amp; the
      Rhode Island Vessels into Continental pay; which motion I was seconded in beyond any
      expectations, and was further directed by Congress to lay before them an Estimate of the
      Cruisers on this coast. This I shall lay before them this Day, and am of your Opinion, that N.
      London harbor is well situated for the rendezvous of an American Navy;&amp;, my Friend, is it
      not worth while, for <name>N. London</name> to labor, to obtain the advantages of such a Collection of
      Navigation spending their Money there? I think it prudent &amp; adviseable, therefore, for you
      or some other to come instantly down here, by which you may undoubtedly procure an
      advantageous employment for your Navigation. </P>
   <P>P.S. Where is the Maccaroni, &amp; how have you succeeded in procuring a most Necessary
      Article? 2 . . . Will a Battery on Winthrop's Neck, another on Mamecock, &amp; a few Guns on
      the heights on the [eastern] Shore, secure that Harbor? How far up the Norwich River is their
      Sufficient Depth of Water for a Twenty Gun Ship? </P>

   <P>Dear Sir -</P>
   <P>Williamsburg, October 15, 1775.</P>
   <P>I have by express, your obliging favour of the 5th; we were in some sort, prepared for the
      disagreeable intelligence of the small hopes of an accomodation, by reports and papers here
      intimating the same thing. Colonel [Richard] Corbin has a letter from a hand connected in some
      manner with Admon, that the plan was to withdraw all troops, and send men of war and cutters,
      to put a stop to all foreign trade, and that with each other, and so starve us into
      submission. If this is the case, perhaps [Molyneux] Shuldham may not bring troops. Our affairs
      may perhaps take another turn, when the Congress petition and the Virginia representation
      against Lord Dunmore, reaches the people there. These furious measures seem to have been
      suddenly adopted on the arrival of <name>Lady Dunmore</name>, no doubt with cargoes of aggravating letters
      and misrepresentation from our hero, and just after some fears of Admon respecting the
      Spaniards, were quieted by their loss among the Algerines; whatever be our state, I hope we
      shall meet it with fortitude. Had we arms and ammunition, it would give vigour to our
      measures. We hourly hoped to hear of the arrival of the necessaries, but now fear we shall be
      defeated. A villain has given Lord Dunmore information of it, and he has six or seven tenders
      plying out for it about the capes. What can such a parricide deserve? We have been sitting a
      month, and yet see no hopes of a recess; we are thin, and some present unwell. Colonel Thomas
      is among the healthy. Nine companies of regulars are here, and seem very clever men; others we
      hear are ready,' and only wait to collect arms. Lord Dunmore's forces are only one hundred and
      sixty as yet, entrenched at Gosport, and supported by the ships drawn up before that and
      Norfolk. I have heard of no attempt of his since seizing the printer, and a ship with flour,
      from Baltimore, except sending a party to Sleepy Hole, in pursuit of some powder we had there,
      which he missed about three hours. Most of the inhabitants of Norfolk, except tories, have
      moved out their families and valuable effects. Lord Dunmore, it is said, is much afraid of the
      riflemen, and has all his vessels caulked up on the sides, above men's height, however, they
      may perhaps pay him a visit, ere long. The good news relative to General Schuyler, came as a
      reviving cordial after the other; nothing has yet happened more important in my opinion, than
      this event, if completed, as I hope it is before now. Pray present my affectionate compliments
      to your worthy brethren and the ladies. I am, with great regard, [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Cherokee in Rebellion Road 15th Octr 1775</P>
   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>I did myself the honor to write to your Excellency by Colo. Kirkland some time ago; and at the
      same time sent all the packets that came by the two preceding Mails. I now convey to your
      Excellency those brought by Pond, &amp; am at the same time to beg a thousand pardons for the
      liberty I took in opening your News papers, as by some neglect Lord Williams 2 were not sent
      and in our present forelorn situation you may judge how anxious we must be to read any thing
      from England. It was Committee like freedom, but we don't stick at higher Crimes then felony
      or breach of trust in this Province 3 - The Governor has left me very little interesting to
      say of affairs here, there are great divisions amongst the Leaders, &amp; I firmly believe the
      majority of the people of <name>Charles Town</name> are against all their measures .... </P>
   <P>The 2d of July Capt Tollemache sailed from this harbour for Boston, perfectly well informed of
      the state of this &amp; the neighbouring Provinces of <name>N. Carolina</name> &amp; Georgia with the
      strongest remonstrances from the three Governors both to Gen. Gage &amp; the Admiral; and so
      little regard has been paid to them, that not even a line has been received from either. . . . </P>
   <P>The Cherokee is a great acquisition to us, Cap. Ferguson with good sense, politeness, and
      skill in his profession has the warmest zeal for the good of the Service: he is none of those
      luke warm officers with which we have long been cursed, and we have only to regret his force
      is so unequal to his spirit. <name>De Brahm</name> 4 who he brought out has been plaguing us with his being
      impeded in carrying on the service he was order'd, but the Governor (who has moved from the
      Tamer to this ship) has cut him very short. A fine time to talk of his surveys of a Country
      that we are in a doubt to whom it may belong - I shall be happy on every occasion to receive
      your commands, &amp; am with the most perfect Esteem &amp; respect Sir [&amp;c.] </P>
   <P>Alex. Innes</P>
   <P>N B I take the Liberty of inclosing under your Excellency's Cover a few lines to Mr [James]
      Penman to request his good offices to this poor skipper. I shall be much mortified if my old
      friend is the Malcontent you alude to.</P>

   <P>Cherokee Arm'd Ship in Rebellion Road 15th Octr 75</P>
   <P>Dear Penman</P>
   <P>I wrote you a long letter some time ago by the post, &amp; a very few days after, because I
      did not chuse to be disarmed by a couple of rascals sent by the Committee, a Letter de Cachet
      was issued by that august body and signed by your old friend <name>Peter Timothy</name>, by which I was
      order'd to quit the Province in 24 hours, the time was enlarged to four days, &amp; I took
      refuge under the wings of old Thornborough in the Tamer. The Governor was soon obliged to
      follow me, leaving a clear stage for your friend [Henry] Laurens, &amp; his Associates. The
      day after I went on board the Tamer, arrived the Cherokee commanded by Lieutenant Ferguson a
      noble spirited fine fellow. He brought out that old F--k Beggar De B--m for survey,2 who
      wanted to get away when he found how things were, but avast hawling that rope Thornborough
      gave an order to Mr Ferguson to remain, against which De B. protested, &amp; finding that
      would not do, he trusted to his connexions with some of the most violent rebels Edwards &amp;
      Mr Parker, got leave from the Commee and landed his effects &amp; suite: he had before offered
      his apartments to the Governor, which he now accepted, and fairly took possession, to the
      great mortification of De B. who had the assurance yesterday to write to the Governor he
      should again come on board, and turn him. out for that was the plain English of it, &amp;
      received aproper answer. We know but little what is doing in Town, they are much divided
      amongst themselves, &amp; had we a respectable force here, we could soon alter things, but
      these Provinces are much neglected. You would see Mr Kirkland to whom I refer'd you for all
      news. I was so busy the morning he went off, with our English Dispatches, it was not in my
      power to write by him. Tell [Daniel] Chamier [Jr.] he is a shabby fellow only one letter I
      have received from him since he left Georgia - all his friends are well but d[amna]bly in the
      Dumps. To my astonishment I hear you are commenced aflaming Liberty Boy, is it possible who
      deserves the name of Oliver now James? For Gods sake dont let pique, or passion lead you to
      abet a set of as worthless miscreants as ever existed, but I beg your pardon I am saying two
      much when I know so Little, therefore shall only add whatever your politlcal Tenets are I
      never can be less your Affect. Friend </P>

   <P>N. B. A poor Devil blown from the Northward loaded with Fruit &amp; Cyder got in here by a
      miracle. The Men of war would not take the advantage of his misfortunes, but as we did not
      love the people of <name>Charles Town</name> well enough to send them apples, we thought of our E. Florida
      friends, and the Governor has desired me to recommend him to your good Offices as a Merchant.
      The poor man means to winter with you, &amp; pick up a few pence along shore in his Little
      Bark if he can. His escape was a most providential one. He will tell you his own story and
      give you all the news to the Northward his name is <name>John Wan</name> ton of the Sloop Polly &amp; I
      pray God we may get him clear of this harbour. Hitherto he has had no communication with the
      Town. Walker the Gunner of <name>Fort Johnston</name> is sent with him by the Governor to help him in
      navigating his Vessell and I'l be obliged to you if you will shew the Gunner some little
      Count'nance while he stays at St Augustine, he is a rattling fellow but well affected to
      Government, for which your <name>Charles Town</name> friends Tarr'd &amp; feather'd him some time ago.
      Remember me kindly . to Chamier, and God Bless you both, not one scrape of a pen from any Soul
      since I left England but <name>James Mill</name>. I had almost forgot to tell you <name>Peter Timothy</name> intercepted
      some Letters of <name>Robin Wells</name> to his Wife &amp; open'd them. <name>John Wells</name> furnished with a large
      stick &amp; the first time he met Timothy without saying a word he fell'd him to the Ground

   <P>Dear Sir</P>
   <P>Montreal 16th Octr 1775</P>
   <P>I have had the long wish'd for satisfaction of hearing from You at last on the 7th Inst I recd
      yours of August 14th and imeadiately desired my friend at Quebec to find Mr. Bliss and get
      from him Your Letter of the 13th which I recd the 14th Inst with an excuse of Mr Bliss that he
      had left it on Board with his Baggage. Your Letter in ansr to mine of April the 6th I have not
      recd, hence You may naturaly conceive me very unhappy concerning you and <name>Mrs Fanueil</name> but am
      now releived and happy to learn you had determined on going to winter in <name>Nova Scotia</name> because
      you will certainly be in safety there. the Admiral can never Suffer the Colonists to cross the
      Bay Fundy and Seize that Province nor can Public affairs Continue to be conducted as they have
      been hitherto. from the little knowledge I have of America, and of Millitary Operations, I do
      conceive General Gage cannot Winter at Boston and. that ere this he will have determined to
      quit it because Should it remain longer undetermined it may not be in His Power to Quit Boston
      without quiting America, my meaning is that he cant Winter all his Troops at Halifax therefore
      Part of them must come to Quebec and it is Necessary to that end they should now be Embark'd
      or they will not get up the River, the Hunter Sloop of war is arrived at Quebec from Boston
      perhaps she may Bring some News of the Kind.</P>
   <P>Your intention of Quitting America next Spring and with the fragments of your Fortune
      purchasing an Annuity for Your and <name>Mrs Fanuiel</name>'s Lives, in case publick affairs shall not
      alter much for the better, I greatly approve, at the same time hope you will not have occasion
      to Carry it into execution Surely the Kingdom of Great Britain cannot much longer be Governd
      by such weak Councils and feable Efforts, she has scarcely got a secure Province in America as
      to this, it has long been on the brink of falling into the hands of the most despicable
      Wretches had not the Inhabitants of this Town gone out to meet Co'lonel Allen on Monday the
      25th Ultimo the Town and principal part of the Province would now have been in their Hands,
      and that fellow would Probably have been Governor of MontreaI; thank God that days Action
      turnd the minds of the Canadians and I have reason to hope the Province out of Danger at least
      for this Year and doubtless ample protection will be afforded it early in the next</P>
   <P>as to the affairs of W &amp; R 2 I have great Pleasure in telling you I have sent them home
      £40.000 Stg since my Arrival £32000 of which in Furs P the Ship Pomena Capt [John] Green which
      Saild from Quebec the 2d Inst. had it not been for the unhappy troubles which have reign'd
      this year, I should have sent Ten Thousand Pounds more, but I've reason to be Content and
      happy in having made a Voyage to America in 1775</P>
   <P>The Province of <name>Nova Scotia</name> Stands much indebted to W &amp; R and I should be happy to have it
      in my power, as it is my wish, to Visit it before my return to England but I conceive both the
      affairs of that Province and this demand my presence in London as soon as possible, for which
      reason it is my intention to leave Quebec in the Ship Adamant About the 10th of next Month
      Hoping to arrive about the 15th of Decr before Parliament shall be adjourn'd should my
      presence in <name>Nova Scotia</name> be absolutely necessary I shall in Discharge of my Duty visit it next
      Spring, at the same time I hope in God that may not be the Case for I ardently long for Peace
      and home. </P>
   <P>Your friends <name>Messrs Jona</name> &amp; <name>Isaac Clarke</name> would have done well had not these troubles
      followed them to this Province they have long had their Goods Packt, ready for embarking but I
      hope they will not be Obliged to ship them, our Friend Butler writes me he had resolved to go
      to London with his wife in the Canadian Capt Abbott - should that happen I hope you will get
      to Halifax before his departure and take Charge of W &amp; R power of Attorney -</P>

   <P>To the Honble the Great and General Court of the Colony of the Massachusetts-bay now sitting
      at Watertown</P>
   <P>The Officers of the Eastern regiment of Militia in the County of Lincoln, in a Council at
      Boothbay in said County met, October 16th 1775 Most humbly shew,</P>
   <P>That at the beginning of the present war the townstocks of ammunition within their bounds were
      very insignificant; and many able &amp; spirited men in the regiment were destitute of
      effective fire arms.</P>
   <P>That every means possible in their circumstances have been tried to remedy these defects - and
      tried in vain.</P>
   <P>That the frequent alarms, &amp; consequent general musters of this regiment, arising from the
      restless attempts of our unnatural enemies, to which the busy &amp; extensive sea-coast within
      our bounds, peculiarly exposes the inhabitants of this County, &amp; especially the Eastern
      part of it, occasions a greater waste of ammunition here than in most places distant from the
      camp; &amp; unavoidably produces a constant demand for it. </P>
   <P>That, the appearance of a fleet in this harbour (which after three days stay, and various
      amusing movements, has magnified its valour by the burning of one dwelling-house - &amp;
      carrying off about one hundred sheep - and this morning disappeared) has called out to use all
      the ammunition, which had not gone off with Col. [James] Cargill to Long island. </P>
   <P>That the Expedition under Col. Cargill is like to spend alithe Ammunition he has taken; and if
      so, this Regiment is like to be left destitute of an article without which this much
      endangered coast can never be defended; and with which tho' chearfully ready to lay down the
      price, they see no way to supply themselves. </P>
   <P>That the Schooner Britannia of, &amp; for Newbury-port, Wm. <name>Pierce Johnson</name>, Master, arrived
      here yesterday, with a quantity of powder &amp; arms from the West Indies; on the Account of
      the late Comee of Supplies of this Colony: </P>
   <P>That the conveyance of said stores will be very hazardous while this coast continues to be
      harrassed as at present by the foe. </P>
   <P>That, the inhabitants being ready chearfully to pay for what arms and ammunition may be
      supplied them, &amp; as ready to use both in the defence of American Liberty, tho' even their
      lives be expended with them; Your petitioners pray that such part of the said cargo as to your
      Honor's may seem meet may be ordered to be delivered to Col. Cargill, for the use of the
      Militia of his regiment, they paying him for the same, &amp; your petitioners as in duty bound
      shall ever pray.</P>

   <P>May it please your Honours This day arrived here the Schooner Britannia William <name>Pierce Johnson</name>
      Master having on board a quantity of arms &amp; ammunition which he sais is for the province
      Use, The great necessity there is for ammunition &amp; arms in this County &amp; the daily
      alarms we have had &amp; are still subject too induces me to desire that some part of the
      ammunition that is on board the Schooner may be delivered to some suitable person for the use
      of the Companies stationed on the Eastern Shore</P>
   <P>I have drawn from the Selectmen of this town what ammunition they cou'd spare. I have also
      rec'd from Coln [James] Cargill 25 lb of powder &amp; ball in proportion for the use of my
      Company. But as part of my men are on an Expedition with the Coln (and as I have heard by
      common report have had an Engagement) &amp; we have for this three days past been under alarm
      from the Enemy, Powder ammunition is so far expended that in case of a general attack (which I
      daily expect) we cannot make such a defence as our honour &amp; interest requires us to do - I
      therefore (as <name>Coln Cargill</name> is now absent) humbly pray, that some of the ammunition may be left
      in this County for the use beforementioned, also that Capt Johnson may have orders that he
      deliver to any of the men of the stationd Companies a stand of arms they giving him a receipt
      for the same to be deducted Qut of their Wages. I am, may it please your Honours [&amp;c.] </P>

   <Title>LETTER FROM REV. JACOB BAILEY1</Title>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>[Falmouth, October 16.]</P>
   <P>On Monday morning, about nine, the same number of shipping appeared in the offing, and seemed
      by their motions approaching the harbour, the wind still continuing to blow hard from the
      north-west. About eleven we perceived them within <name>Cape Elizabeth</name>, and spreading all their
      canvass to secure the harbour, and at three they had beat up to Hog Island and came to anchor,
      almost a league from the town.</P>
   <P>Soon after their coming to an anchor, we observed the barge from the Commodore rowing in
      pursuit of a small schooner, which, notwithstanding the discharge of several muskets and two
      cannon, escaped in safety to the town. The populace which were gazing by hundreds were
      immediately thrown into furious agitation by this incident, and vowed revenge with the utmost
      menace and caution.</P>
   <P>The Committee, composed of tradesmen and persons of no property, prompted only for a flaming
      zeal for the liberty of their country, were not less enraged at this hostile appearance, and,
      to display their wisdom and courage, they ordered the company of guards to take possession,
      who in obedience to these instructions, stole safely down in the close of the evening to
      secure the cattle, to intimidate the tories and to observe the motions of the enemy. </P>

      Correction; and the Merciful and Paternal extension of her Hands to embrace you, again and
      again, have been regarded as vain and nugatory. And in place of a dutiful and grateful return
      to your King and Parent state; you have been guilty of the most unpardonable Rebellion,
      supported by the Ambition of a set of designing men, whose insidious crews have cruelly
      imposed on the credulity of their fellow creatures, and at last have brought the whole into
      the same Dilemma; which leads me to feel not a little for the Innocent of them, in particular
      on the present occasion, having it in orders to execute a just Punishment on the Town of
      Falmouth: In the name of which Authority I previously warn you to remove without delay the
      Human Species out of the said town; for which purpose I give you the time of two hours, at the
      period of which, a Red pendant will be hoisted at the Maintopgallant Masthead with gun: but
      should your imprudence lead you to shew the least resistance, you will in that case free me of
      that Humanity, so strongly pointed out in my orders as well as my own Inclination. I also
      observe that all those who did upon a former occasion fly to the King's Ship under my Command
      for Protection, that the same door is now open and ready to receive them. The Officer who will
      deliver this letter I expect to return unmolested. I am &amp;ca</P>

   <P>ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FROM <name>GEORGE WASHINGTON</name> TO CAPTAIN <name>NICHOLSON BROUGHTON</name> 1</P>
   <P>Sir:</P>
   <P>Head Quarters, October 16, 1775.</P>
   <P>The Honble Continental Congress having received Intelligence, that two North Country
      Brigantines of no Force, sailed from England some Time ago for Quebec, laden with 6000 Stands
      of Arms, a large Quantity of Powder and other Stores; you are hereby directed to make all
      possible Dispatch for the River St. Lawrence, and there to take such a Station as will best
      enable you to intercept the above Vessels.</P>
   <P>2nd. You are also to seize and take any other Transports laden with Men, Ammunition, Clothing,
      or other Stores for the Use of the Ministerial Army or Navy, in America and secure them in
      such Places as may be most safe and convenient.</P>
   <P>3rd. The other armed Schooner named the Lynch 2 and commanded by Captain Sellman, is to be
      under your general Command but you are to advise and concert with him the proper Stations and
      the proper Time to continue this Service.</P>
   <P>4th. You are to endeavour, if possible, to discover whether the above Vessels have passed by.
      If they have, you are not to return; but keep the Station as long as the Season will admit. As
      there is agreat Probability that Quebec will fall into our Hands in a very short Time, it may
      be expected that not only the above Ordnance Vessels; but others from Quebec and Montreal may
      come down and fall into our Hands.</P>
   <P>5th. As there may be Men of War at Newfoundland, you are so to conduct as to prevent being
      discovered by them; or any Intelligence given of your Station.</P>
   <P>6th. Whatever Vessels you may meet, bound in or out of the River St. Lawrence, which you have
      Reason to believe are in the Service of the ministerial Army or convoying any Stores to them
      of Provision, or of any other Nature, you are to endeavour to seize, though they should not be
      Transports regularly engaged by Government.</P>
   <P>7th. For your Encouragement and that of the Officers and Men under your Command, you will
      receive one third Part of the Value of any Prizes you may take as well military Stores as the
      Hulls of such Vessels, nothing being excepted but the wearing Apparel and private Stock of the
      Captains, other Officers and Passengers of such Prizes.</P>
   <P>8th. Should you meet with any Vessel, the Property of the Inhabitants of Canada, not employed
      in any Respect in the Service of the ministerial army, you are to treat such Vessel with all
      Kindness and by no Means suffer them to be injured or molested. I am, Sir, etc. 3 </P>

   <P>Newport, October 16.</P>
   <P>Last Monday [October 9] the men of war, after firing on Bristol and Papaquash, went into the
      ferry way between Portsmouth and Bristol, and fired near 200 shot at the houses and people on
      each side; 3 shot struck the house of Capt. Earl near the ferry, which is all the damage done
      there that we hear of; 60 shot, we hear, were fired at the windmill, without hitting it. From
      thence some of the ships, tenders and transports, went and surrounded Gould-Island and took a
      few sheep; others went to Hope Island, and got 2 or 3 young cattle; thence they proceeded to
      Dutch-Island, in Narragansett-Bay; where were upwards of 100 rams, part of which some people
      from Narragansett took off, while the vessels lay there; the remainder, about 60, the enemy
      took away. On the whole this fleet, by cruising and firing about our bays and harbours, for
      near a fortnight, have got about 40 head of cattle great and small, and 180 sheep, including
      the cattle bought of the Brentons, and 60 rams; the 150 sheep mentioned in many papers of last
      Monday being a mistake; for we are well informed they got but 5 sheep from Brenton's neck. </P>
   <P>The same day the Glasgow fired a number of cannon upon the town of Jamestown, without doing
      any damage, except beating one stone out of a house. </P>
   <P>The men of war, tenders, &amp;c. came down the bay and anchored in this harbour, last
      Thursday.</P>
   <P>Within 14 days past the men of war have taken out, and cut away, the masts, bowsprits, &amp;c.
      of a number of small sloops and ferry boats. </P>
   <P>Last Friday in the afternoon a barge, with a number of hands from one of the ships in this
      harbour, landed at the N.W. part of this town, took a boat which lay haled up on the shore,
      and was carrying her off, when the owner got his musket, ran down to the shore, and fired upon
      the barge, but did no execution; upon which the Glasgow, and one of the tenders, fired several
      shot at the owner of said boat, but missed him. - A 9 pound shot, from the Glasgow, entered
      one side of Mr. <name>Matthew Lawton</name>'s house on the Point, carried away a part of a beam inside, and
      fell down, without hurting any person. </P>

      Took the Liberty of Examining the Mate &amp; Crew Of the Ship &amp; upon a full hearing of

      bring her up to the Landing to prevent her falling into the Enemys hands &amp; to Notifie the
      Owner &amp; Freighter thereof - This day the Freighters &amp; Capt Niles Met at the Landing
      the Latter inform[e]d he had Orders from your Excellency &amp; the Committee of Safety to
      Bring her up to the Barr &amp; No farther untill further Orders - however as the Owners were
      Desirous of having her brought up to the Landing to Repair the Vessel, as the Inconvenience
      Could happen if She proves to be oh a Smuggling Voyage - We have advised to her Coming up
      Agreeable to the Vote of the Committee &amp; Wait Your Ex-cellencys further order - </P>
   <P>We shall only Remark that this Wheat is now as Near the Camp as it Can be Transported with

      - We must Also Say Nothing appeard of any Design of fraud from the Acct Given by Mate or

   <P>Yours in Provincial Congress of the 12th inst. enclosing sundry resolutions of the Continental
      Congress, we yesterday received; and on consulting with Mr. Romans, the engineer, have made
      the severnl remarks thereon, which we now send you enclosed. As soon as time will permit, we
      shall view the place recommended, more strictly than we have had any opportunity to do. At
      present, the engineer informs us, he cannot give an estimate of the charge of a further work
      that may be necessary at Pooploop's Kill.</P>
   <P>We shall exert ourselves in forwarding the work carrying on here, and every other order the
      Provincial Congress may command. We beg leave to request you will communicate this with the

   <Title>REMARKS BY BERNARD ROMANS 1</Title>
   <P>Highlands, October 16th, 1775.</P>
   <P>If it be considered that the season when this work was undertaken was very far advanced, I
      think that we are in as forward a situation as can be wished for, and I make no doubt but the
      work begun will in three weeks time be of sufficient strength to stand the brunt of as large a
      ship of rank as can come here, and two or three small fry.</P>
   <P>Heavy cannon, such as of 18, 24 and 32 lb. seem to be all that is wanted. I think on Saturday
      next [October 21] to be able to mount from 12 to 18 cannon, 8 of which at least might be heavy
      ones. We are in a miserable timber country, even fascines are with more difficulty got than
      stones; of the last we have such plenty that in four days 150 perches of wall has been
      properly laid by 12 masons. We want more workmen, especially masons, and our [men] require a
      regulation prescribed to them, which it seems impossible to bring them under, until they be
      properly officered and distributed, each division having its proper department allotted. </P>
   <P>It is not only the difficulty of getting timber, but we have fully experienced that the part
      of the work which is done in timber advances slower than the stone, by a degree beyond all
      comparison.</P>
   <P>A battery at Moore's house seems, at present, to me entirely useless. I will examine further
      into this article. </P>
   <P>The point on the west side above Verplanck's point, is too easy of access, and in the vicinity
      of many ill disposed people; besides this, it can be of little use. But at Pooploop's kill,
      opposite to Anthony's nose, it is a very important pass; the river narrow, commanded a great
      ways up and down, full of counter currents, and subject to almost constant fall winds; nor is
      there any anchorage at all, except close under the works to be erected. It is a very easy
      matter to establish posts for intelligence with the upper country and Connecticut; for the
      last I intend to go in person, in about two or three weeks time. With those in the Jerseys I
      am not so perfectly acquainted, but if the country people are well affected, I know the roads
      admit of the most expeditious intelligence, and of our receiving the readiest assistance. </P>
   <P>I understand that it will be an easy matter to obstruct the navigation of the river, so as to
      confine it to 12 or 14 feet; and in that case it remains large enough for our use, and without
      new inventions and constructions the enemy can then do us very little hurt. </P>

      with decency and good manners, nor are they to put them to unnecessary delay, or trouble, but

      brass cannon, and a large quantity of gunpowder. Capt. Brown's vessel was so heavy a sailer,
      that the frigate was obliged to take her in tow coming down the channel. Capt. Brown informed
      Capt. Robinson, that a brigantine, under convoy of a frigate, had sailed for Virginia with

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P><name>No Carolina</name> Cruizer Sloop of War, in Cape Fear River Octr 16th 1775. </P>
   <P>Your Lordship may depend I will not fail in the strictest observance of His Majesty's commands
      to exert every endeavour, and to employ every means that shall be in my power to aid and
      support General Gage and Admiral Graves in all such operations, as they may think proper to
      undertake for carrying The King's orders into full execution, and restoring the authority of
      His Majesty's Government. at the same time, I grieve to be obliged to acknowledge to Your
      Lordship, that I have not the least power at present to assist their operations. </P>
   <P>Mr <name>Samuel Johnston</name> having summoned and convened the late Congress at Hillsborough and presided
      therein; and having also accepted the Office of Treasurer of the northern District of this
      Colony under the appointment of this unconstitutional Assembly, of his own creation, in open
      violation of an Act of the Provincial Legislature, by which Treasurers are appointed, and
      actually existing, I have thought it high time, and indispensibly my duty to supersede him as
      Deputy Naval Officer of this Province, 2 and I have accordingly appointed Mr Archibald
      Neilson, a Gentleman well qualified by his knowledge, integrity, and good principles, to act
      in that Office until His Majesty's Pleasure shall be known he is indeed the only capable
      person, that in my present state cut off from all intercourse with the Country, I can appoint,
      or with whom I can communicate upon the subject. I do not think however, that I could, at any
      time, make a better choice in this Province, </P>
   <P>It is possible also that the resentment of Mr <name>John Ashe</name>, occasioned by his disappointment of
      the chief command of the military establishment formed by the Provincial Congress will cause
      some division here: for it seems he and his friends are raising men of their own authority in
      opposition to Mr <name>James Moore</name>, his brother in law, who is appointed Military Chief under the
      Congress. </P>
   <P>In cases of seizures made by The King's Ships it is to be apprehended, it will be very
      difficult, if not impracticable to form Courts of Vice Admiralty for their Tryal in this
      Province, as well as in other of the Colonies for want of communication with the proper
      Officers. in that event Your Lordship knows that Officers of the Navy will be exposed to
      prosecutions, for detaining, beyond a short limitation of time, Vessels they may seize under
      the late Act of Parliament restraining the Trade of some of the Colonies, which are thereby
      directed to be tried, as other seizures, in the Courts of Admiralty; unless in these special
      cases, and when the proceedings of such Courts shall be opposed, and obstructed, as will
      probably happen, some provision is made by law for their indemnification. </P>
   <P>Mr. <name>Alexander McGregor</name> late Master of the Snow: Relief, stranded here in the month of March
      last, gave me about a fortnight ago a detail of Captain [John] Collet's proceedings with
      regard to his Cargo upon which he laid in claim as a Salvager. and by this man's account, as
      well as from other circumstances that have come to my knowledge, I am bound to conclude that
      Mr Collet's conduct on the occasion was exceedingly injurious, and unjustifiable. I
      recommended to Captain Collet, on his first report of the case to me at New Bern, to take The
      Attorney General's opinion and advice for his rule and guide, and to be governed by them
      minutely, or he would certainly subject himself to prosecution, and very probably to great
      damages. he accordingly did advise with The Attorney General, I am informed, but followed
      nevertheless his own judgment; which by the representations of Mr McGregor, I fear was formed
      more upon views to his own gain and interest, than upon any principles of justice, equity, and
      charity; all of which the nature of the case ought to have excited in the strongest manner. I
      much lament <name>My Lord</name> that I have so much reason in this affair, and on other accounts to alter
      my favorable sentiments of Captain Collet, of whom, and of his principles, I was wont to think
      highly. </P>
   <P>In a North Carolina Gazette of the 29th of September, Your Lordship will see a most pompous
      display of Discoveries of military stores in and about my house at New Bern, almost every
      article of which the Author of this abuse, I am persuaded, well knows to be old stores,
      deposited there by Governor Tryon after his expedition against the Regulators, which it seems,
      my Servants, in their abundant caution, had buried, as described in the News Papers, to keep
      them out of the hands of the Mob. of mine, or of my provision, there was nothing among them,
      but two kegs containing between forty and fifty pounds of Gunpowder (called quarter casks in
      the News Paper) which I had bought, and intended for saluting The King's last birthday and
      which on my previous, and necessary departure from New Bern, I directed to be put away in some
      place of Security.</P>

   <P>Captain Tollemache of the Scorpion Man of War, having very fortunately for us, touched at

   <P>Some days after his arrival, an american armed vessel, came to anchor at the west End far out

   <P>And We are very apprehensive, that She came for the Cannon that they might know to be in Store

      both of opinion, that it was much the best way for Captain Tollemache to take charge of the
      Cannon in Store, and put them on board His Tender or large Transport, to prevent the said
      Cannon to be Carried off, in the same maner as the powder was, and applyed against His
      Majestys army. We have delivered to Him thirty peices of Iron ordnance with the Carriages and

   <P>LETTER FROM REV. <name>JACOB BAILEY</name> 1</P>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>[Falmouth, October 17.]</P>
   <P>All however remained in profound peace and tranquility till eleven o'clock the next morning,
      when the sternmost ship got under sail and the rest in succession.</P>
   <P>It was half after two before the Commodore weighed anchor, when the whole fleet stood directly
      up the river, and formed in line of battle before the town. We now plainly discovered one ship
      of twenty guns, one of sixteen, a large schooner of fourteen, a bomb sloop and two other armed
      vessels.</P>
   <P>The Commodore, who proved to be Capt. Mowatt, had no sooner come to anchor and handed his
      sails, than he fitted out his barge, in which he dispatched an officer on shore, with a letter
      directed to the inhabitants of Falmouth. He landed at the lower end of King street, amid a
      prodigious assembly of people, which curiosity and expectation had drawn together from every
      quarter.</P>
   <P>Some of the multitude appeared in arms, who united with the rest to convey the officer with
      uncommon parade and ceremony along the street to the Town House. His entrance was immediately
      followed by a confused mixture, which filled the apartment with noise and tumult</P>
   <P>At length the officer being seated with the Committee; who took possession of the Judge's
      seat, and silence commanded, a letter was delivered and read by Mr. [John] Bradbury, a lawyer,
      but not without such a visible emotion as occasioned a tremor of his voice.</P>
   <P>It is impossible to describe the amazement which prevailed upon reading this alarming
      declaration: a frightful consternation ran through the assembly, every heart was seized with
      terror, every countenance changed colour; and a profound silence ensued for several
      moments.</P>
   <P>During the astonishment which had seized the multitude, I quitted the apartment of justice and
      became a spectator of what passed in the street, where nothing occurred but scenes of tumult,
      confusion, and bustle.</P>
   <P>A number of considerate gentlemen, however, made choice of a committee, viz:, Brigadier
      [Jedediah] Preble, Dr. [Nathaniel] Coffin, and Mr. Pagan, to wait upon the Commodore. He
      received them with expressions of humanity, and even shed tears at the repetition of his
      orders. At the earnest entreaty of these gentlemen, he consented to suspend execution till
      sunrise, upon condition that the people would agree to deliver up a number of their arms. Upon
      the return of this committee the inhabitants assembled in the Court House, and readily
      complied with the requisition. </P>
   <P>The arms being delivered to the Commodore about eight, he granted them a further respite till
      nine the next morning, and besides, engaged that, if the town would surrender their cannon and
      musketry, and give hostages for their future good behaviour, he, would delay the execution of
      his orders till he could represent their situation to the Admiral, and intercede for their
      final deliverance. </P>
   <P>At the same time Capt. Mowatt assured them that if any person should presume to escape by
      water during the night, he would immediately fire upon the town. When the committee returned
      the second time, they found the disposition in the people to assemble in the morning, but the
      zealous sons of liberty dispatched messengers into all the adjacent country and the
      inhabitants were beating drums, firing alarms, and mustering under arms for thirty miles
      round. Some companies entered Falmouth before midnight, and protested that if any compliance
      or submission was made, they would burn it to ashes. </P>
   <P>And, that no provocation might be offered to Mowatt by persons of indiscre~ tion a number of
      moderate gentlemen voluntarily engaged their services to parade the streets, and prevent any
      disorder that might arise. </P>

   <Title>NARRATIVE OF <name>DANIEL TUCKER</name> OF FALMOUTH 1</Title>
   <P>[Falmouth, October 17.]</P>
   <P>He returned again in October with five vessels under his command, two ships, two schooners and
      one sloop; they arrived and anchored in the lower harbour on the 16th and laid all night
      without any communication with the town, and the inhabitants were greatly terrified at the
      appearance of this hostile fleet, until it was ascertained that Captain Mowatt commanded the
      whole; on the morning of the 17th the fleet got under weigh in a calm and began to warp up
      toward the town with kedge anchors. About 8 oclock A.M. my master [Paul] Little came on
      horseback to the shop door, called me out, and told me he was going to Windham, and to be gone
      several days, and that he should send people to me with orders to pay for their labor &amp;c.
      I then asked him if he knew the fleet was coming up, and that people in general were of
      opinion that it was coming with hostile intentions against the town; and he replied to me that
      Captain Mowatt had the command and there was no danger! He went to Windham and left me at 15
      years of age with the care of both shops. The ships and vessels were until four o'clock P.M.
      before they got to their anchorage before the town, and the inhabitants generally were in a
      state of alarm, and many began to move out for safety. Mrs Little was very much frightened and
      began to think of moving, and sent me with two old looking glasses out to a place called
      Capiseack, when I had deposited the treasure, worth about five dollars!! and was about
      remounting my horse, a Windham man came by on a gallop, and told me the town was to be burned
      in two hours. I told him where Mr. Little was in Windham, and desired him to send him word,
      and he promised he would but did not. I rode into town with all speed, and found Mrs. Little
      with her children at the front door, ready to go; she delivered to me a bag with all her
      husbands money, books and papers, and with her children walked on to Mr Deering's farm. I then
      took all the money out of the shops, and all the gold and silver ware, and carried the whole
      and delivered it to her, and went into town with a charge to save all I could before <name>Mr Little</name>
      could get in: and with nobody to help me but the females I got every thing ready to load up
      carts, in expectation of Mr Littles arrival every minute; and at nearly midnight he had not
      arrived, and I was fortunate enough to get a man and horse to go after him at two oclock in
      the morning. This man found <name>Mr Little</name> in bed and asleep not knowing any thing of the
      distressed situation of the town. </P>
   <P>When Mowatt had his fleet moved and ready to fire he sent his barge on shore with an officer
      under a flag of truce with a long letter to the committee that he had orders to set the town
      on fire immediately on his arrival; but he added, that from feelings of humanity he would take
      it upon himself so far to deviate from his orders as to allow two hours to remove the
      &quot;human species.&quot; Immediately upon this official communication being read a
      respectable committee went on board the Canceaux and entered into a conference with Mowatt,
      and with much difficulty prevailed on him to defer his work of destruction till nine o'clock

      Broughton &amp; Capt Selliman will not be ready these 2 Weeks to which the long Delay already
      &amp; frequent Disappointment makes us give some Credit - The General is much dissatisfied I
      cannot but think a Desire to secure particular Friends or particular Interests does mingle in
      the Management of these Vessels - The Number of Workmen we are told is inconsiderable - &amp;
      in Short it is said in plain Terms, that it will be made a job of - I thought it proper to
      mention to you what has been said - &amp; at all Events unless you can engage that the Vessels
      who are to remain at &amp; about <name>Cape Ann</name> &amp; that Coast shall be ready in 5 Days one must
      be got at Newbury Port as I cannot but think from all we hear that it would expedite this
      Business to have one Vessel fitted out from thence Six Transports came into Boston Yesterday -
      If our Cruizers find themselves watched at Marblehead &amp; <name>Cape Ann</name> they must run out in the
      Night &amp; Cruize farther off. Should they take any Prizes they must send them to Plymouth or
      some other Town on that Coast - We are told that our Vessels make a Practice of running in
      every Night when they have been out &amp; the Men come on Shore - This must be rectified -
      <name>Capt Manley</name> is to have one of the Vessels left for the Coast about <name>Cape Ann</name> - General
      Sullivan's Captain will have another - Manley's Vessel will be mann'd from your Regiment - I
      have said so much upon Dispatch that - I need Say no more than that if they are not soon at
      Sea we shall heartily repent it was ever undertaken - I this Morning paid Major [William] Lee

      [Benjamin] Wormwell provided you can agree with Wormwell. Martindale is to Command but

      make proper Inquiry about her &amp; act accordingly -</P>
   <P>If it is absolutely necessary to procure proper Guns at Providence &amp; Bristol, you must go,
      but we have always found that when Gentlemen Sent upon this Business go among their Friends,
      they are apt to stay too long &amp; are induced to favour their Friends in such Articles as
      may be wanted so as to delay the Business I therefore think it necessary to give you this
      Caution - </P>
   <P>Inclosed are Mr Watson's Instructions which you will please to deliver him - Pray consider
      that after the Guns are procured the Ammunition is to be provided, &amp; no Cartridges can be
      made 'till you Send former - unless Ammunition is to be procured there - You will also please
      to bear in Mind that our, Situation as to Powder does not admit these Vessels being fitted out
      at all Points, nor will the Time Admit - Cap Martindale having been used to have a Vessel
      where nothing was wanted I fear will not make suitable Allowances - If Wormwell's Vessel
      should not be found to Answer or cannot be had but upon such Terms as you do not chuse to

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>I have had the Honour to receive your Excellency's Letter October 1. The Provisions on board
      the Victualler at Halifax are for the use of the Fleet alone, and had not my Lords
      Commissioners of the Admiralty been extremely provident in timely sending Supplies the Kings
      Ships during the Winter would have been greatly distressed for Victuals; Your Excellency will
      therefore perceive I cannot consent to any other appropriation of the Provisions upon which we
      place our sole Dependance for Support; and that the Transports being sent to Halifax was
      purely for the Convenience of supplying the Ships there.</P>
   <P>The King will undoubtedly be pleased to find such an attention to the Security of his Na val
      Yard and Stores at Halifax; I am satisfied your Excellency will readily contribute your utmost
      to a Service of such importance to his Majs Fleet; but I fear it is too late to begin even
      temporary Works, and that the principal Dependance must be on the Kings Ships in Halifax
      Harbour.</P>
   <P>I shall continue a good Force in the Bay of Fundy, and Ships shall winter at Annapolis [Royal]
      and if possible at Windsor: By which means the Fears of the well disposed will I hope be
      removed, and the turbulent and disaffected deterred from attempting what must eventually
      involve them in destruction. There is I fear too much Communication between the Rebels of the
      Eastern parts of New England and the People of <name>Nova Scotia</name>. It would be of singular use to
      discover a few of the Principals concerned in aiding, abetting or advising the rebellious
      Proceedings now carrying on in New England Governments. It is high time to make Examples, in
      which your Excellency may always depend upon my utmost Assistance.</P>
   <P>What you observe about the Men of War touching at Passamaquody is very proper and shall be
      attended to.</P>
   <P>I acknowledge the Receipt of your Excellency's Dispatches to Lord Dartmouth in one Packet,
      which shall be transmitted by the first Opportunity. I am &amp;c.</P>

   <P>Sir- </P>
   <P>We have used all possible despatch to complete the fortifications on Hudson's river, and we
      expect they will be in such forwardness in about six weeks, as to have most of the cannon
      mounted. The commissioners have been directed to make the necessary inquiries respecting the
      other small batteries, and in the obstructing of the navigation of Hudson's river, mentioned
      by Congress in their order of the 7th inst. to which due attention shall be paid. We are of
      opinion that four companies of matrosses, consisting of at least eighty men each, will be
      wanted to occupy these forts when completed, and that one company at least should be
      immediately raised, that we may in time have more properly trained to the use of cannon, as
      the utility of our fortifications will much depend upon it.</P>

      following, to wit: </P>
   <P>In Provincial Congress, New-York, Oct. 17th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Gentlemen - We have received complaints from sundry persons, with relation to the conduct of
      some among you, who have maltreated the commanders and passengers of vessels navigating
      Hudson's river, for not lowering the peak of their mainsail upon passing the fort. Those who
      have been provoked by this demand, complain that you should of your own authority, without the
      recommendation of the Congress, exact instances of respect from your fellow citizens. You must
      at once be sensible that so trivial a token, or the omission of it, can never mark out our
      friends from our foes, or answer any other valuable purpose. At the same time it is evident
      that great disgusts have arisen from the peremptory demand, and probably bloodshed may ensue.
      The Colonies have sufficiently suffered through punctilio, and we beg you will desist from
      exacting marks of submission or respect of any kind, until a plan which is now in agitation
      shall be completed, which may tend to obviate the future intentions of our foes to pierce into
      the interior of the Colony, through the natural communication which the river affords; to
      prevent this, is the intention of the fortification which you superintend, and therefore all
      signals from vessels going backwards and forwards should in our opinion be singly [or simply]
      confined to that object, and be by no means used as instances of complaisance to the Congress
      or its officers, when the peace and safety of the community so loudly forbid it. </P>

   <Title>LETTER FROM REV. <name>JACOB BAILEY</name> 1</Title>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>[Falmouth, October 18,]</P>
   <P>The morning was calm clear and pleasant, without a breath of wind, and the town was crowded
      with people and carts from the country to assist in removing the goods and furniture of the
      inhabitants.</P>
   <P>At exactly half an hour after nine the flag was hoisted at the top of the mast, and the cannon
      began to roar with incessant and tremendous fury.</P>
   <P>The Commodore, perceiving the streets replete with people, oxen and horses, directed his men
      to fire over the tops of the houses, but this solemn exhibition struck the multitude into
      instant alarm and amazement. The oxen, terrified at the smoak and report of the guns ran with
      precipitation over the rocks, dashing every thing in pieces, and scattering large quantities
      of goods about the streets.</P>
   <P>In a few minutes the whole town was involved in smoak and combustion.</P>
   <P>About a thousand men in arms attended this scene of devastation, besides a prodigious number
      of both sexes, without attempting any repulsion.</P>
   <P>The bombardment continued from half after nine till sunset, during which all the lower end and
      middle of the town was reduced to an heap of rubbish. Several houses in the back street and in
      the upper part, together with the church shared the same fate. The front of the Meeting house
      was torn to pieces by the bursting of a bomb, and the buildings which were left standing had
      their glass windows broken, and both walls and apartments terribly shattered.</P>
   <P>In a word about three quarters of the town was consumed and between two and three hundred
      families who twenty four hours before enjoyed in tranquility their commodious habitations,
      were now in many instances destitute of a hut for themselves and families; and as a tedious
      winter was approaching they had before them a most gloomy and distressing prospect. </P>

   <Title>NARRATIVE OF <name>DANIEL TUCKER</name> OF FALMQUTH 1</Title>
   <P>[Falmouth, October 18,]</P>
   <P>During the night [of October 17] the people saved all they could. About 4 oclock in the
      morning Mr. Little got in with two stout teams which we loaded and sent out; and besides what
      we thus saved, the tide being up we loaded a gondola at Porter's wharf with West India goods,
      and sent it around the neck, and then left a great amount of Property to destruction. When the
      time drew near to nine o'clock, and the people generally had gone out of town, Col. <name>John Waite</name>
      came by our house and seeing Mr. Little in the house spoke like one in a fright, and said
      &quot;Little! it is time to go; they will fire in a few minutes&quot;; his answer was &quot;I
      shall go directly;&quot; and turning to me he said, &quot;Daniel, you had better go.&quot; and
      I replied, .&quot;I shall go when you do.&quot; We soon started, we went through Federal
      street and around Sanfords Corner through Back street, and when I was almost abreast of the
      windmill that stood where <name>Sam Husseys</name> does now, Mowatt hoisted a red flag, and fired the first
      gun, and the shot whistled along between me and the old meeting house. The other vessels in
      the fleet having already commenced a spiteful fire, and continued it with very little
      cessation until six oclock P.M. The first house that was fired stood where Mr Gorham now
      keeps; the building burned down without communicating with any other; but it was but a short
      time before all the north part of the town was in a blaze. They landed in their boats from all
      their vessels at the same moment and threw torches into the doors and windows of the houses
      and stores, and then fled like cowards on board their little fleet. Among the public buildings
      were a handsome new Court House that stood where the north school house did, and the Episcopal
      Church that stood on the lot adjoining Mr Newhalls dwelling house. All the buildings on
      [blank] street, on Fore street, from Fort Burrows to Exchange street and on Middle Street as
      far as <name>Jonah Cox</name>'s house, were burnt down, and a more melancholy sight or a more cowardly
      transaction I did not witness through the remainder of the war; and before it was over I was
      in three engagements at sea. Mowatt immediately withdrew his fleet from the town, and the next
      day sailed for Boston, which was then held and blocked by the English. Many people have blamed
      the inhabitants of Falmouth for not defending the town against so small a force: but the truth
      is it was not in their power, for there was not a cannon mounted in town at that time, and
      there was a great scarcity of powder. There was an old decayed fort and blockhouse where Mrs.
      Weeks house and garden is; this fortress was built in the resign of Queen Anne, and therefore
      was in a ruinous state by the dilapidation of time: the people all fled into the country in
      the beginning of winter which set in uncommonly early; they went out poor and had to live
      among a people as poor as themselves; and those that have occupied the stage of life from that
      time can form but a faint idea of what their ancestors suffered in those &quot;times that
      tried men's (and women's) souls.&quot; </P>

   <P>As I think his Majesty's Service will be benefited by the Ships and Vessels employed in the
      Bay of Fundy being under the immediate direction of the Commodore at Halifax I inclose the
      necessary Orders for that purpose.</P>
   <P>Every appearance of Accomodation between Great Britain and her Colonies is vanished; the
      latter have made their Election in War, which we are now carrying on against each other in the
      four New England Governments, with great Bitterness. I have not the least Doubt that most of
      the Southern Colonies will soon follow the Steps of their Brethren to the Northward, the same
      spirit of Rebellion diffusing itself through the whole Continent. What then becomes our Duty
      but with all possible Dispatch and Spirit to carry his Majesty's Commands into Execution by
      making the most vigorous Efforts to punish this ungrateful people and lay Waste their Country
      on the Sea Coast? I inclose an extract of a Letter from Governor [Francis] Legge for your
      information. As Passamaquody is not far from the Bay of Fundy, direct any Sloop or small
      Vessel you may have to call there occasionally, and get all possible intelligence of the
      Rebels intentions and proceedings.</P>
   <P>The Somerset being compleated and the forwardness of the Hinchinbrook give me great
      Pleasure.</P>
   <P>There is no Marine Cloathing here except Shirts and Stockings by the Adventure, of which you
      have no doubt reserved some at Halifax and can be supplied from thence.</P>
   <P>The 1500 Men from Newbury Port, who were expected to be gone towards Halifax, went up
      Kennibeck River, and tis generally believed are for Quebec, from whence we have lately
      received very unfavourable Accounts.</P>
   <P>I cannot close this Letter without assuring you of my entire Approbation of your Conduct with
      respect to the Ships and in the Yard, where I hope the very necessary regulations and order
      you have introduced will be punctually observed; I shall continue to rely upon your Zeal for
      the Service and your Discretion to pursue every measure for the publick Good, so far as your
      Authority and Influence may extend, in which you may depend upon my Countenance and Support;
      having nothing more at heart than to serve his Majesty faithfully myself, and to discourage
      and punish every attempt to the contrary in all other persons. I am &amp;c </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Wednesday Tyonderoga Octo: 18th</P>
   <P>Since my last of the 5th instant, General Montgomery has favored me with several Letters,
      Extracts whereof I do myself the Honor to in close You. 2</P>
   <P>The General's Complaint in No 1 that he wants Men is too well founded (the enclosed Return
      will shew how much the Army is reduced by Sickness &amp;c.) at that time all the Men that I
      could send, were on the Wing to join him, and they arrived on the 9th as You will see by
      Number 2. It is too true that very few of the Men he sends to this Post return, the greater
      Part of them are so averse to going back, that they pretend Sickness &amp; skulk about and
      some (Even Officers) go away without Leave, nor can I get the better of them, Altho I do not
      suffer a Ration of Provision to be issued, unless I countersign the Order, and the sick or
      pretended sick do not get half Allowance.</P>
   <P>What little Money I have been able to procure at Albany; I have sent on - I fear the Want of
      Species will be fatal to Us, should every Thing else go will, the Canadians have suffered much
      by Paper Currency, and a burnt Child dreads the Fire.-</P>
   <P>Two hundred and fifty three of General Wooster's Regiment came across <name>Lake George</name> on Sunday,
      but the General is not yet arrived and they do not chuse to move until he does. Do not chuse
      to move! Strange Language in an Army, but the Irresistable Force of Necessity obliges me to
      put up with it. - This Morning I gave an Order to Lieut Colo: [Andrew] Ward to send a
      Subaltern, a Serjeant Corporal &amp; twenty Privates, in two Batteaus to carry Powder,
      Artillery Stores and Rum, The Colo: (who is a Good Man) called upon Me to know If he would not
      be blamed by General Wooster for Obeying my Orders, I begged him to send the Men, &amp; urged
      the Necessity, the Men I believe will condescend to go; I could give many Instances of a
      Similar Nature; But General Montgomery has most justly &amp; Emphatically given the Reason,
      &quot;Troops who carry the Spirit of Freedom into the Field &amp; think for themselves&quot;
      will not bear either Subordination or Discipline. -</P>
   <P>If there is any Foundation in the Report that the Garrison intend quitting <name>St Johns</name> I
      conjecture It must arise from Intelligence that Mr Carlton may have received of Colonel
      Arnold's Approach, should the Garrison effect their Escape It may go hard with Arnold, whose
      Numbers in so long and fatiguing a March must be considerably diminished I have therefore
      reques[ted] General Montgomery to send immediate Intellige[nce] of his Situation and
      Prospects, that Colo: Arnold may Govern himself accordingly. -</P>
   <P>I am deeply impressed with the Necessity of putting this Place in a proper Posture of Defence.
      - I have wrote on the Subject to Congress before, but I have now only 65 Effectives here
      (Exclusive of General Woosters) who are Insufficient for the Necessary Works carrying on. - </P>
   <P>I cannot help observing that the Reasons General Montgomery gave in Support of his Opinion for
      having a Battery on the West Side, appears to me so Cogent, that I wonder the Council of War
      should be opposed to it; But he was certainly Right to acquiesce in their Determination, as I
      am morally sure If he had not, that the Men would have been troublesome. -</P>
   <P>I have no Prospect of getting my Health reestablished at this Place, but in the present
      Critical Moment, I dare not leave It. Much very much is to be done, whether we succeed or fail
      in Canada, The Distance between this &amp; Philadelphia Great, and the season so far advanced
      that the least Delays may be attended with the most fatal Consequences, I therefore humby
      submit It to Congress, If it would not be best, to send up a Committee with full Power to
      direct our future Operations, to me such a Measure appears highly necessary. -</P>
   <P>General Wooster is just arrived here, as he was appointed a Major General by the Colony of
      Connecticut and that I did not know his Sentiments with Respect to the Rank he considered
      himself In, in the Continental Army, My Intentions were to have him to remain at this Post,
      but assuring me that his Regiment would not move without him and that Altho' he thought hard
      of being superseded Yet he would most readily put himself under the Command of General
      Montgomery, that his only Views were the Public Service and that no Obstructions of any kind
      would be given by him, This spirited &amp; sensible Declaration I received with Inexpressible
      Satisfaction, and he moves to Morrow with the first Division of his Regiment. </P>
   <P>Mr. [Gunning] Bedford has mustered such of the New York Troops, as he possibly could, they
      were so scattered that it was morally impossible he could see the whole he has done Every
      thing in his Power to fullfill his Duty, without being able to compleat It, the Reasons of
      this Failure are various; he will inform the Honorable Congress why the Connecticut Troops
      were not Mustered; - I have directed him to return to Philadelphia and report what has been
      done previous to his Departure I desired him to depute Mr Macpherson my Aide de Camp, In case
      It should be possible to make another Muster which I believe will hardly take Place this
      Campaign. - I am Sir [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>Gentlemen - </P>
   <P>[Highlands] October the 18th, 1775.</P>
   <P>I have taken the liberty to enclose to you the paper delivered to me by Mr. Yates, and Mr.
      Glen. Those gentlemen behaved with the greatest politeness, and I imagined that their
      observations would have been sufficient to have set every thing at the fort in proper order.
      As for my part, when I undertook that business, it was from pure love to my country, and to
      the rights of mankind, without any views of self-interest; and never expected any pay for what
      I did; and I believe that those who were joined with me acted from the strictest principals of
      honour. I can with truth say, that never any man was ill used passing that river, by any of
      us, unless he abused us; and then to receive but a small check, not equal to his demerits. It
      would have been acting genteel to have inquired into the complaint laid before Congress,
      before passing a censure upon the gentlemen at the fort, contained in the four first lines of
      your letter to them. When men act upon principle, and are placed at any particular post of
      consequence, and find themselves in a precarious situation, it naturally follows they must
      exercise their own judgment for the good of the post, and ought to be supported by those who
      placed them there; which has not been the case in this instance. An insult offered to them was
      offered to the Congress, and the abuse of the complainants in Congress ought not to have been
      permitted. Had the Congress answered our letter relative to the very thing complained of, this
      never would have happened. I must therefore request, gentlemen, the favour of the Congress to
      appoint somebody in my room, for I will never more go back to the fort. I am respectfully,
      gentlemen, [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Dear Sir</P>
   <P>Montreal 19th Octr 1775</P>
   <P>I wrote you by the Cillery Capt Hardie from Quebec on the 18th ultimo Acknoledging receipt of
      your Esteemed favour of August the 19th when I made you acquainted with the unhappy Situation
      of this Province. I then wrote you fully concerning Kavanag'hs affairs and desired in Case any
      accident should prevent the Canadian from ariving, or that she should Load Fish for Europe
      that you would Charter a Vessel to send home Kavanaghs Oil and Furrs &amp;c The Adamant did
      not Arrive at Quebec till after I had Charter'd a Ship to Carry home her intended Cargo. I had
      two Country Vessels with £32,000. Stg in Furrs on board waiting her Arrival at a time when the
      Bostonians were hourly expected to master the Province here. I thought it my Duty, and did
      Charter the Ship Pomona Capt [John] Green for £375. to Proceed with Furrs &amp;c to London and
      she Sail'd from Quebec the 2d Ins it was my Intention to have gone home in her and had
      prepair'd every thing Accordingly but Alter'd my Mind and came off for Montreal the Morning
      she was to sail for London and I Confess to you that no one measure I ever took afforded one
      half the Satisfaction, this City and the Greatest Part of the Province would have fallen into
      the hands of the Colonists on the 25th of Last Month had not the Inhabitants marched out to
      meet and give them Battle they fought Conquered and saved the Province at least for a while.
      Colonel Allen who Commanded this despicable Party of Plunderers (they were prornis'd the
      Plunder of the Town) was with most of his Wretches taken. He is now in Irons on board the
      Gaspee; this action Gave a Sudden turn to the Canadians who before were Nine tenths for the
      Bostonians, there are great Numbers now in arms for the King but the Enemy have Possession of
      the South side of the River as low as Verchere except the Garison of <name>St Johns</name> which they still
      Invest with little hopes on their side and little fear on ours of it being taken, the
      beginning of the Month I was much alarmed on receiving News from Boston that Halifax was
      taken, from this I was soon releived by your most welcome Letter of Septr the 1st which was
      soon followed by those of the 16 &amp; 21st all which I now mean to answer - I doubt not the
      Trade of Halifax being dull but I shall be much disapointed in my Conjectures if it does not
      soon Mend. I think <name>Genl Gage</name> cant Winter at Boston, Consequently that he must soon send a part
      of his Troops to Halifax and the rest to this Province, where they are much Wanted for
      notwithstanding the Bostonians are not likely soon to take <name>St Johns</name> there is some danger of
      their geting this Town and Every other Part of this Province except Quebec unless its soon
      Suported by the Kings Troops, as to Your Province I am not under any Apprehension of its being
      over run by them they will never send Men [t]here Let their Success be ever so great, they
      cant support them the Winter and I further think all possobility of their succeeding will be
      Cut off by the Admirals orders to take and destroy all their Vessels. I am with you of opinion
      that if a Land War is to be Carried on, it had better be Conducted thro' this Country leaving
      the Navy to Manage their Sea Coast, I much fear the operations of the Army this Winter will
      prevent your going home with <name>Mrs Butler</name>, I am sorry Her Indisposition should make such a
      Voyage necessary, at the Same time I shall have Pleasure in seeing you there, should that be
      the Case I know not any Person in Halifax with whom you can Confide Watsons &amp; Rashleigh's
      Power of Attorney Mr Faneuil writes me of his Intention to winter there with <name>Mrs Faneuil</name>
      should He arrive before your departure Pray make over our power to Him. I have wrote him a
      line on the Subject. should he not Arrive leave the Power lockt up with Your other Papers our
      accts &amp;c The Ship Adamant is nearly Loaded with Oak Timber There will be some Furrs and
      Twenty odd Passengers for Her, its my design to Leave Quebec about the 10th of Next Month and
      I hope to be home before Parliament Adjourns for Chmass Holydays. </P>
   <P>I have read your address to the King Loards and Commons and cant help admiring the delightfull
      Bull &quot;we feel for our Mother Country of which many of us are Natives.[&quot;] Its a good
      one. tell my Friend Doctor Breynton I wrote him from Quebec on the 21 July last P the Cellery,
      and did hope he wd have given me a Line in Ans </P>
   <P>Pray push home every shilling of remittance which you Can lay hands on for W and R at these
      Times of General want, will Stand much in need of it remember me to <name>Mrs Butler</name>, and beleive

   <P>Canceaux in Casco Bay 19th October 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>The fluctuating state of the winds and weather since my departure from Boston, have occasioned
      the delay of this Letter, as will appear in the following part of it. The morning after
      leaving the Harbour, the Canceaux with the other Vessels, were brought too off the entrance of
      <name>Cape Ann</name> Harbour, with an intention of going in the moment that the day appeared; but to my no
      small mortification a strong gale. from the Northward reduced the Vessels under their low
      Sails, so much so, that the Symmetry and Spit fire went almost broadside to Leeward: finding
      myself in this situation, I judged it expedient to secure a Harbour, and accordingly directed
      the course for Cape Cod; where we anchor'd in the evening of that day. The next morning the
      wind shifting to the Southward of the West, we got under Sail, and at day break the following
      morning, we were close in with <name>Cape Ann</name>. Upon viewing the Town, Mr Grant the Artillery
      Officer, gave it as his opinion, that the houses stood too scattered to expect success, with
      the Ordnance and Stores of his department, and in particular from the small number of
      Carcases, and the uncertainty of their goodness. On considering the ill consequences of a
      disappointment in the first attempt of this expedition, and the advantage of encouragement it
      would afford the rebels, I thought it most prudent to make choice of an object, where the
      certainty was more secure; tho it was not without reluctance I passed this port, as your
      orders directed me there first, as well as the favourable opportunity of attempting Squam at
      the same time, which I certainly should have done, had the number of troops been sufficient to
      have landed. The proceeding morning the wind carried us off <name>Cape Elizabeth</name>, where we again
      were saluted with a second Northwester, which obliged us to take shelter in the evening of
      that day, under Squirrel Island in Townsend-bay, here we were detained a part of two days, and
      in the evening of the third, anchored at Hog Island road in Casco-bay: At four in the
      afternoon of the day following, the Vessels were all placed before the town of Falmouth
      without the least resistance: finding the people so disposed, I wrote them a letter (a copy of
      which I transmit with this) and sent Mr Fraser the Acting Lieutenant on shore to deliver it,
      which he did, and heard it read in the town house before a large number of the inhabitants;
      upon it being read, there was a profound silence, and it was desired to be read a second time,
      after which, the Chairman with many of the principal people, in particular those who had never
      joined in any part of the Rebellion, lamented and judged by the stile of the letter, that the
      punishment was very severe, and more so still, as the time limited was so very short, and that
      too with the night approaching. Mr Fraser seeing a general distress increase, among the women
      and children in the Streets, he gave to understand, that if they had any proposal to make to
      me, he would be the bearer of it, at the same time he could not take upon him to say that it
      would be received: Upon which they observed that upon his going on board if the boat did not
      return again in a few minutes, a Committee in the name of the Town would wait upon me, which
      they did; by name - Brigadier [Jedediah] Pribble [Preble], Doctor [Nathaniel] Coffin, and Mr
      Pegan merchant, deputed to know the nature of the chastisement, and to request that a longer
      time might be allowed them, as it was then just upon Sundown. I replied that from the nature
      of their crime they had not the least right to expect any lenity, and that the power in me
      vested, authorised me to distinguish those only who I was certain had never aided or assisted
      in their rebellions proceedings but notwithstanding that, the known Humanity of the British
      Nation encouraged me, to take so far upon me, that on condition that the people of Falmouth in
      general would in the course of the time that I had given them, deliver up all their Arms and
      Ammunition with such of themselves as I should make choice of, that I would in that case put
      off destroying the Town until the determination of the Commanders in Chief of the King's
      forces at Boston should be known, To this the Committee replied, that they would make my
      demand known to the people immediately, but that it would be impossible to accomplish it,
      without certain time being granted for the purpose of Assembling them: I observed, that if it
      was not in their power to do it compleatly this night, they surely could do a part, and
      therefore, if the town expected a longer time, so many of their Arms must be delivered onboard
      the Canceaux before Eight o'Clock with the Five Guns that I knew to be on Carriages in the
      Town, also the rest of the arms with Brigadier Pribble and such others as I should make choice
      of, to be forthcoming in the morning: at the same time considering this and every other
      indulgence void, upon the least hostile appearance of any kind whatsoever. The Committee
      declared that the guns on Carriages were removed out of the town on the first appearance of
      the shipping but that they would do, their utmost in bringing off as many arms as could be
      brought together in so short a time; On this promise I suffered them to go on shore, and
      before the hour of Eight they returned with Ten stand only-delivering them as a pledge of the
      faith of the Town in general, that nothing hostile should be offered, and that if my demand
      was not fully complied with by nine the next morning (which they beseeched me to grant them)
      as it would be impossible to clear the town of the women and children before that hour in case
      of noncompliance. This request I agreed to, and desired a Committee to be with me half an hour
      before the time limitted, to which they were punctual; when they declared that to their no
      small astonishment, they found that no part of the Inhabitants assembled in the morning, and
      that the whole town was then in the greatest confusion, with many women and children still
      remaining in it; as to themselves, they had only to implore time to go on shore and get out of
      the way, on which they took leave of the Ship with expressions of thankfulness for the lenity
      that had been shown-Perceiving women and children still in the town, I made it forty minutes
      after nine before the Signal was hoisted, which was done with a gun, at the same time the
      cannonade began from all the vessels and continued till six, by that time the body of the town
      was in one flame, which would have been the case much sooner, had the Wind favored in the
      forenoon as it did in the evening, and altho' a regular cannonade was kept up all the time,
      nu{nbers of armed men were employed extinguishing the fire before it became general which made
      it absolutely necessary for some men to be landed, in order to set fire to the vessels,
      wharfs, storehouses, as well as to many parts of the town that escaped from the shells and
      carcases, notwithstanding they were executed with the greatest dexterity, to the no small
      credit of Mr Grant the artillery Officer, who employed his people, not only onboard, but on
      shore also, with a certain number of seamen from each of the Vessels, and a party of Marines,
      all under the command of Mr Fraser whose spirited conduct, and activity in the execution of
      that duty, does him every credit that could be expected from such a service, and indeed every
      man that was with him. And with equal justice I can say, that all the Officers and men on this
      command, shew'd the greatest readiness, and acted with the greatest composure and harmony in
      their respective duties; and with no less satisfaction I acquaint you, Sir, that
      notwithstanding the vast numbers of armed men that assembled in, and near the town on the
      occasion; Falmouth, with the Blockhouse and battery, the principal wharfs and storehouses,
      with eleven sail of vessels, at and near this town, several of which with cargoes, all laid
      into ashes, including a fine distillery, four vessels taken, all without the loss of one
      person, and only two slightly wounded, Mr <name>Larkin Midshipman of the Canceaux</name> and one Marine. At
      the same time I am sorry to say, that had we not been situated close to the town, we should
      without a doubt have found great difficulty in accomplishing this piece of service, as we soon
      experienced the insufficiency of the artillery stores, not only in goodness, but in quantity;
      the particulars of which shall at a more convenient opportunity be laid before you Sir, which
      I am sorry to observe will not reflect great credit on the ordnance store at Boston: And with
      equal concern I observe, that the want of a sufficient number of troops, has prevented an
      effectual sweep being made of all the arms and ammunition not only belonging to the town of
      Falmouth but also of many Islands and Villages in Casco-bay, which I am very certain could
      have been compleatly done with five hundred men - as well as numbers of Cattle and other fresh
      provisions equally useful, and not less distressing to this part of the country.</P>
   <P>Our Carcases excepting a few belonging to the Howitzers are all expended, and these are
      rendered useless by the carriages being disabled which happened early in the Bombardment. The
      Spitfire Sloop is also much shattered, so that I shall be under the necessity of repairing to
      Nantasket to have these wants supplied before I can attempt any other place. The troops are
      also in great distress for want of necessarys, many of them having embarked without a second
      shirt, from which cause they are rendered incapable of their duty, and are falling sick very
      fast. My intention was to dispatch the Halifax immediately with this Letter, but having four
      vessels to man and take care of I consider it most prudent to keep our small force together
      till we are nearer. I have the honor to be with the highest respect Sir [&amp;c.] </P>

      their Arms, and give Hostages for their future good behavior he was to destroy that Town &amp;
      afterward proceed &amp; destroy this Capt Mouat however acquainted the Com that in case they
      would deliver up part of their Arms that night he would give them till next Morning to

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Providence, October 19th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir, -</P>
   <P>Here, nothing material has happened since your departure. But it seems there is a party in
      Newport endeavoring to get the troops re-called off the island, for reasons, in my opinion,
      not sufficient only for the flattering promises of Capt. [James] Wallace. He promising to let
      the wood and ferry-boats pass as vessels, and not to rob them of any stock on that island, and
      that he will not fire on the town without provocation, unless he is hereafter ordered, and
      then not without fore warning. In consideration of the above promises, he is to have the
      privilege of fresh meat and beer, &amp;c., for his ships as usual. But his faith and promises
      have been of so little value to us, in this government, I hope they will not have much weight.
      It seems to be strongly reported that the majority of that town are against the troops being
      re-called, and if that be the case they must be under the necessity of going out also. The
      Tory party, and Wallace's fleet, will have the entire government of that town, and doubtless
      take that opportunity to rob all the islands in the bay. They don't pretend to say he promises
      for only the island of Newport. It seems to be the opinion of the principal inhabitants of
      this town, that a regiment at least ought to be stationed there, not only for the protection
      of the stock, but the friends of liberty also, which they hitherto scarcely dare show their
      sentiments.</P>
   <P>Wallace is much nettled at what force is there at present. His connections are supposed to be
      the movers of the Town Council, and those concerned in this application, as we are informed .

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>The Continental Congress having taken the six first Regiments raised this Year in the Colony
      of Connecticut (of which Yours is one) into the Pay &amp; Service of the Associated Colonies
      at the earnest Request of the Honorable Delegates representing the Colony of Connecticut, and
      You having in a Variety of Instances obeyed the Orders of Congress who have conferred on You
      the Rank of Brigadier General in the Army of the Associated Colonies, I was taught to believe
      that You considered Yourself as such both from what I have above Observed and from Your
      Declarations to me Yesterday, but I am just now informed That You have called a General Court
      Martial at <name>Fort George</name> on Your Way up here, a Conduct which I cannot account for unless You
      consider Yourself my Superior, and that cannot be in Virtue of your Appointment by Congress,
      by which You are a Younger Brigadier General than Mr Montgomery, And unless You consider
      Yourself as such, I cannot consistent with the Duty I owe the Public Permit You to join that
      Part of the Army now under Brigadier General Montgomery's Command, least a Confusion and
      Disagreement should arise that might prove fatal to our Operations in Canada. You will
      therefore Sir please to give me Your explicit Answer to this Question; Whether You consider
      Yourself and your Regiment in the Service of the Associated Colonies &amp; Yourself a Younger
      Brigadier General in that Service than Mr Montgomery or not? that no Misapprehensions or
      Misrepresentations may hereafter arise. I am Sir, [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>In Answer to Your Favour of this Day, give me Leave to acquaint You, that immediately upon my
      Receiving the Continental Articles of War, I gave them out to the different Captains &amp;
      Commanders of Companies in my Regiment, but they universally declined signing them, of
      Consequence in the Discipline of the Troops under my Command, I was obliged to continue in the
      Use of the Law Martial of Connecticut, under which they were raised, Which I certainly had a
      Right to do, by Virtue of my Commission from that Colony, Upon the same Principle I ordered a
      General Court Martial at <name>Fort George</name>, which, whether right, or not, was never designed in the
      least, to contradict or counteract Your Authority, as Commander in Chief of the Troops upon
      this Department. -</P>
   <P>With Regard to the other Question, My Appointment in the Continental Army, You are sensible
      could not be very agreeable to me, Notwithstanding which, I never should have continued in
      that Service, had I not determined to observe the Rules of the Army; No Sir, I have the Cause
      of my Country too much at Heart, to attempt to make any Difficulty or Uneasiness in the Army
      upon whom the Success of an Enterprize of almost infinite Importance to the Country is now
      depending - I shall consider my Rank in the Army, what my Commission from the Continental
      Congress makes it, and I shall not attempt to dispute the Command with General Montgomery at
      <name>St Johns</name>. - As to my Regiment, I consider them, as what they really are, according to the
      Tenor of their Inlistments and Compact with the Colony of Connecticut, by whom they were
      raised, and now acting in Conjunction with the Troops of the Other Colonies, in the Service
      and for the Defence of the Associated Colonies in General. You may depend Sir that I shall
      exert my self as much as possible to promote the strictest Union and Harmony among both
      Officers and Soldiers in the Army, &amp; use every Means in my Power to give Success to the
      Expedition. - I am Sir, [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>New-York, October 19.</P>
   <P>We hear from Rhode Island, that Col. <name>Esek Hopkins</name>, a brave and experienced officer, is arrived
      there, at the town of Bristol, with 700 men, sent by General Washington in order to protect
      the inhabitants from the Piratical incursions of a Captain Wallace, and other Free-Boaters,
      acting under the pretended authority of a set of Traitors, aiming to establish a tyrannical
      government on the mins of the English Constitution.</P>
   <P>This Pirate, Wallace, having presumed, in a cowardly dependance on his lawless force, to
      demand the property of the inhabitants, and like other Robbers, threatening them with
      destruction in case of refusal, which threat he inforced, by murderously and treasonably
      firing a number of shot against the town of Bristol, the inhabitants of which, sent on board
      the said Pirate, a Committee to expostulate with him on the baseness and villany of his
      conduct. - In his vindication, he shewed them the orders of the more atrocious and bloody
      Traitors, under whose authority he acted, by which he was directed to fire upon, murder and
      destroy every town or city, where there should be the least appearance of men in arms, in
      order to defend their rights and liberties; and he told them, that in case there should be the
      appearance of men in arms, in opposition to His illegal demands, he should certainly fire upon
      them. After he had by threats, extorted from, and robbed the inhabitants of as much of their
      property as they were, on such a sudden demand, able to produce, Col. Hopkins and his forces
      arrived, and on being told Wallace's menace of firing upon the town, in case of the appearance
      in it of men in arms, he let the people know his orders from the General, which were, at all
      events to prevent the Pirates from landing, - or receiving supplies from the shore; and that
      instead of being intimidated from def ending their property, by fear of the town being fired
      upon, they might be assured he would destroy the town, rather than the Pirates should land in,
      or draw supplies or advantage from it. </P>

   <P>A draft of instructions to the superintendents at the fortifications in the Highlands,
      respecting vessels passing the said fortifications, was read and filed, and is in the words
      following, to wit: </P>
   <P>Gentlemen-</P>
   <P>In Provincial Congress, New-York, Oct. 19, 1775.</P>
   <P>We are favoured with yours of the 15th inst. and are pleased with your activity in forwarding
      the fort and works under your charge in the Highlands. To obviate all disputes relative to
      your conduct, it is our desire that you would dispense with the ceremony of vessels lowering
      their peak as they pass the fort; we think it cannot answer the purpose of detecting the foe,
      and that for the future you would observe the following rules: </P>
   <P>1. In general we do not apprehend any danger can arise from vessels coming from the northward;
      you may therefore let them pass unmolested unless you shall have evidence on oath, or a
      certificate from some committee previously given, that they are intended to supply the
      ministerial army or navy with succours or necessaries, in which case you are to detain them
      until you can give the Congress or the Committee of Safety notice thereof, together with such
      evidence or certificate and receive their orders.</P>
   <P>2. You will permit all vessels from the southward to bass by unmolested, unless you shall have
      good reason to suspect that they are prosecuting designs, inimical to the general cause, and
      in such case you will prevent them from proceeding until you shall be satisfied that they have
      no such designs.</P>
   <P>3. We recommend it to the superintendents of the fort, and also to the inhabitants of the
      Colony by their general conduct, to use their endeavours to cultivate a good understanding
      with each other. Being confident that the superintendents will not permit those employed under
      them to use illiberal language to persons navigating the river, and that they will in the
      exercise of their office give as little trouble to the inhabitants of the Colony as is
      possible. </P>
   <P>We are respectfully, gentlemen, [&amp;c.] By order. To the Commissioners at the fortifications
      in the Highlands. </P>
   <P>Ordered, That a copy thereof be engrossed and signed by the President, and transmitted. </P>
   <P>Ordered, That <name>Timothy Doughty</name> and all the other prisoners now in the jail, by order of the
      Committee of Safety, be brought down before this Congress tomorrow morning to be heard, and
      that Col. McDougall be requested to furnish a sufficient guard for that purpose. </P>

   <P>Governor Tryon arrived from England soon after this 3 and every thing respecting the Custom
      House went on Quietly; as it was found by experience that any stoppage of Trade would be
      immediately felt severely and the Collectorfrom the time the Custom House had been locked up
      and as long as he remained at New York always carried the Seals of Office about him and
      Publickly declared, if he was obliged to leave the place, for to ensure personal safety, he
      would carry off the Seals or destroy them. In the Fall of the Year 1775, Governor Tryon
      received private Information that he and all the Officers of Goverment and the Revenue were to
      be made Prisonirs and sent to a Neighbouring Province; Governor Tryon convened such of them as
      were named in this information, they immediately agreed to go on board Ship except the
      Collector, who told them his situation was different from theirs, all Civil Authority had been
      for some time taken out of their hands. but that he had still been allowed to Act in his
      station because the Present Rulers found it their Interest as their Ships without his
      Clearances could not pass the Two Men of War stationed at New York, besides he did not think
      any personal risque could excuse his not acting agreeable to the Acts of Trade until they were
      suspended by Parliamint or stopped by Violence, which he must submit to. The Governor and
      Kings Attorney &amp;ca accordingly went on board Ship 4 . . . The Collector was waited upon by
      a deputation fromthe New York Congress the day after the Governor left the City, to know if he
      intended going, He answered No, if proper obedience was sti[ll] paid to the Acts of Trade and
      he and his Family protected, this was promised and punctually complyed with and a Guard set
      over the Custom House: The Collector giving his Word of Honor, not to remove or cause to be
      removed any of the Papers or Books belonging to the Custom House or Receiver Generals Office,
      which were kept in the same House with the Custom House. </P>

   <P>Usually we write one letter per month with the Paquet Boat, and enclose a short extract of
      your report: so meanwhile I will do the same with your mail, particularly the accounts of the
      Unit 2 ... we have done likewise with our balance of accounts, since in this critical time not
      much else is advisable, expecially since it is well known that here as well as in England,
      letters are opened, and therefore most of the captains that still put out from England refuse
      to take along letters, let alone packages, in order to be in no way exposed; our last letters,
      which contained little more than the Weeklies, came with the August Paquet from England. </P>

   <P>Philadelphia, 19 Oct. 1775</P>
   <P>Sir -</P>
   <P>The Continental Congress having been pleased to appoint us a committee for collecting an
      account of the hostilities committed by the Ministerial troops and navy in America, since last
      March, with proper evidence of the truth of the facts related, the number and value of the
      buildings destroyed, and of the vessels, inward and outward bound, seized by them, as nearly
      as can be ascertained; and also, the stock taken by them from different parts of the.
      Continent, as you may see by the resolve enclosed 2; we entreat the assistance of the
      Convention of your Colony in this business, that we may be enabled to perform what is required
      of us, in the manner and with the expedition Congress expects; and to that end, that you will
      be pleased to furnish us with the necessary materials, sending to us clear, distinct, full and
      circumstantial details of the hostile and destructive acts, and the captures or seizures and
      depredations in your Colony, and accurate estimates of the loss and damage, with the solemn
      examinations of witnesses and other papers and documents, officially authenticated. We are,
      sir [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Dr. Sir, - </P>
   <P>[Philadelphia] Octr. 19, 1775</P>
   <P>What Think you of an American Fleet? I don't Mean 100 ships of the Line, by a Fleet, but I
      suppose this Term may be applied to any naval Force consisting of several Vessells, tho the
      Number, the Weight of Metal, or the Quantity of Tonnage may be small.</P>
   <P>The Expence would be very great - true. But the Expence might be born and perhaps the Profits
      and Benefits to be obtained by it, would be a Compensation. A naval Force might be created
      which would do something. It would destroy Single Cutter and Cruisers. It might destroy small
      Corvets or Fleets of these like [James] Wallace's at R. Island and Ld. Dunmores at Virginia.
      It might oblige our Enemies to sail in Fleets. For two or three Vessells of 36 and twenty
      Guns, well armed and manned might attack and carry a 64 or a 70 or a 50 Gun Ship.</P>
   <P>But there is a great Objection to this. All the Trade of Pennsylvania, the Lower Counties, a
      great Part of Maryland and <name>N. Jersey Sails</name> in between the Capes of Delaware Bay. And if a
      strong Fleet should be posted in that Bay, Superiour to our Fleet it might obstruct all the
      Trade of this River.</P>
   <P>Further the Trade of Virginia and the rest of Maryland floats into Chesapeak Bay between the
      Capes of Henry and Charles where a Fleet might stop all. Besides Virginia and Maryland have no
      Navigation of their own nor any Carpenters to build ships. Their whole Trade is carried on in
      British Bottoms by British, most of it by North British Merchants. These Circumstances
      distinguish them quite from New England, where the Inlets are innumerable and the Navigation
      all their own.</P>
   <P>They agree that a Fleet, would protect and secure the Trade of New England but deny that it
      would that of the Southern Colonies.</P>
   <P>Will it not be difficult to persuade them then to bear the Expence of building a Fleet, merely
      for <name>N. England</name>. We are Speculating now about Things at a Distance. Should we be driven to a
      War at all Points, a Fleet a public Fleet as well as privateers might make prey enough of the
      Trade of our Enemies to make it worth while. </P>

   <P>Dr. Sir, -</P>
   <P>Philadelphia Octr. 19, 1775.</P>
   <P>I want to be with you, Tete a Tete, to canvass, and discuss the complicated subject of Trade.
      I say nothing of private Consultations or public Debates, upon this important Head. When I
      write you Letters you must expect nothing from me but unconnected Scraps and broken Hints.
      Continual Successions of Company allow me Time only to Scrawl a Page of Paper, without
      Thought.</P>
   <P>Shall we hush the Trade of the whole Continent and not permit a Vessell to go out of our
      Harbours except from one Colony to another? How long will or can our People bear this? I say
      they can bear it forever. If Parliament should build a Wall of Brass, at low Water Mark, We
      might live and be happy. We must change our Habits, our Prejudices our Palates, our Taste in
      Dress, Furniture, Equipage, Architecture, etc., but We can live and be happy. But the Question
      is whether our People have Virtue enough to be mere Husbandmen, Mechanicks and Soldiers? That
      they have not Virtue enough to bear it always I take for granted. How long then will their
      Virtue last? till next Spring? If We Stop all Trade G.B.I. and W.I. will not be furnished with
      any Thing. </P>
   <P>Shall We then give Permission for our Vessells to go to foreign Nations, if they can escape
      the Men of War? Can they escape the Men of War? How many will escape in Proportion? If any
      Escape, will they not venture to Britain, Ireland, and W.I. in defyance of our Association? If
      they do not will not the British Dominions furnish themselves with our Produce from foreign
      Ports, and thereby avoid that Distress, which We expect will overtake them? Will not the W.I.
      Islands especially, who cannot exist without our Provisions for 6 Months, unless Glou[cester
      (?) and] Walker were ignorant. </P>
   <P>If we should invite other maritime Powers, or private adventures from foreign Nations to come
      here, Will they venture? They run the risque of escaping Men of War, and the Dangers of an
      unknown Coast. Maps and Charts may give Strangers a confused Idea of the Geography of our
      Country, and of the Principal Inlets of Harbours, Rivers, Creeks, Coves, Islands, etc., but
      without skillful Pilots, the danger of Shipwreck will be 10 to one.</P>
   <P>This vast object is never out of my Mind. Help me to grapple it. The W.I., Barbadoes
      particularly, begin, We are told Here by a late Vessel, to be terrified out of their Wits. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>I deferred answering your Excellencys letter expecting the return of the Argo Frigate, which I
      ordered the 7h Instant to carry a Letter from me to your Excellency at Guadaloupe, she is not
      yet returned back, but I hope you have got the Letter I sent by her; By which you will find;
      that I concur with you, in a desire of keeping up the Friendly correspondence that has
      hitherto subsisted between the Government of these Colonies; That I disapproved; of what
      Captain Gordon did; and thought he had been too precipitate which must be sufficient to inform
      you; it was not by any directions of mine he had acted.</P>
   <P>By what your Excellency writes me; I perceive you have been greatly misinformed of the
      particulars of this affair; especially about Capt Gordons boarding several Vessels; and in
      particular one under French Colours which he had struck; and hoisted English in their stead.
      You will see by the Account in writing, which Captain Gordon delivered to me on his arrival
      here (a Copy of which I have now inclosed you) that he had only boarded one Vessel, that she
      was an American; and had all English Subjects on board her, and she had no French Colours,
      therefore of consequence he could not strike them. The behaviour of <name>Monsieur Choiseul</name> with the
      Message he sent off to Captain Gordon, I find has likewise been concealled from your
      Excellency. </P>
   <P>Your Officer being desirous of returning immediately to Guadaloupe apprehending you might be
      gone from thence before his return occasions my answering your Letter before the Argo arrives;
      and to assure your Excellency nothing shall be wanting on my part; to keep up the so much
      desired Harmony between the two Nations. I have the honor to be &amp;[c] </P>

   <P>This is the 33d day that we have been in this disagreeable situation, but I flatter myself
      that our Continuance on this ground is but short. The season is advancing, which will either
      drive us Northward, or Southward, to habitations more comfortable. have the happiness to
      inform you that yesterday the Fort at Chamblee was surrendered to us without the loss of one
      man on our side 70 odd regulars was taken Prisoners &amp; about 94 women &amp; children, which
      transaction gives new life and vigour to our Troops; and adds Courage to the Canadians, whose
      spirits have drooped by the Misconduct of Cl [Ethan] Allen, in Attacking Montreal with so
      Small party that he and his men were allmost intirely cut off, which doubtless you have
      heard.</P>
   <P>The Canadians I think I may venture to Assert are Quite full on our Side, and the Indians
      likewise; whose Friendship we have taken unwearied pains to obtain; but to return to this
      Hornets Nest at <name>St Johns</name>, which still continues obstinate, we in the first Place built a Bomb
      battery about 100 rods South of the Fort which appears to annoy them considerable, we then
      built a gun battery to the Southward of that, but does not have the desired effect. then we
      built a gun battery on the east side of the River off against the Fort, within 100 rods of
      them, in plain sight, at which battery we have kept a continual fire at their water Craft
      (which consist of large scows Gondolas &amp; other Small Craft) till they are so disanabled
      That we have nothing to fear from them. likewise at their houses which by their appearance is
      rendered very uncomfortable to them. We are about building on the North side off them another
      battery. when the whole comes to be opened upon them, on all sides, I think the dogs must
      Surrender or find it very hot weather. we have more or less Cannonading or bombarding every .
      day, but thro the blessing of God we have onely lost 4 men by their Shot &amp; Shells. Our
      Army is in good health in General and in fine Spirits. nothing to Obstruct us from traveling
      thro Canady but this little foutre Place, which I doubt not but in a few days we shall be
      master off. and walk triumphant into Moreal w[h]ere Part of army will winter. to keep the
      Canadians in spirits wether we succeed or not, doubtless a part will Tarry in Canady this
      winter. </P>

   <P>Your Favour this Day came to Hand. Your Conduct in fitting out the Vessels is much approved by
      his Excelly who is particularly pleased with your Dispatch - Colo [James] Warren has wrote to
      [Benjamin] Wormwell about his Demand of 8d more than others, which I hope he will retract,
      otherwise you must endeavour to procure another as we are resolved to submit to no Demands
      that Appear to be unreasonable. The difference to him is Small, but as we must pay the Same to
      others, &amp; in that Case the Difference to the Publick will be considerable - I think you
      had better take the Swivels, but we would not have the Vessel delayed for the Sake of making
      up her Compliment of Ten - Advise with Capt Martingale about the Cohorns, if he thinks they
      will be Serviceable you can take one or both - Inclosed is a Letter to the Committee about the
      Powder The Cartridge Paper will be sent immediately - Capt Adams will have the same Terms as
      other Masters out of Salem &amp; Marblehead </P>
   <P>I shall dispatch <name>Capt Coit</name> assoon as possible, but the General would have you Stay 'till the
      Vessels are equipped &amp; Sailed - If it is not absolutely necessary for Capt Martingale to
      return to Camp before he sails he can stay to superintend the Workmen &amp;c - I cautioned him
      against an extravagant Outset but I fear his former Ideas upon the Subject are insuperable
      there certainly can be no occasion for such a Number of Guns, unless he means to go without
      Powder for them as we cannot Spare so much of that Article as such an outset would require We
      think 8 or at the most 10 Six pounders quite sufficient with 10 or 12 Swivels - Inclosed is a
      Letter to the Committee at Bristol which may be of some Use in procuring the Guns if you are
      obliged to go there for that Purpose - By what I mentioned in my former Letter I only meant to
      give you a Caution as we have been very unfortunate in sending Persons to do Business where
      their Connections lay - It will be best for you to pay all contingent Expences, if you have
      not current Cash Mr Watson the Agent will supply you, &amp; his Draught here upon me for these
      Expences or any other attending the Vessels will be honor'd - If the Committee of Plymouth
      claim a Property in the Vessel notwithstanding she is to be employed on the Publick Ser.vice
      you must agree with them as with private Persons on the best Terms you can -</P>
   <P>Pray forward both Vessels assoon as possible, &amp; in your next let me know when Martingale's
      Vessel will be, ready - if he wants Ammunition from hence let us know in Time that none be
      lost in fitting out these Articles - I am Sir [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Watertown, October 20, 1775</P>
   <P>The committee of Congress arrived here last Sunday [October 15]. Colonel [Benjamin] Harrison
      went through the town without my seeing him. Doctor [Benjamin] Franklin and Mr. [Thomas] Lynch
      stop'd at Davis. I waited on them, and they came over and drank coffee with us. The next day I
      dined with them all at Head quarters, and yesterday they and the general officers, and the
      gentlemen of character from the southward on a visit here, were entertained by the House at
      [Nathaniel] Coolidge's, on the best dinner we could get for them, turtle, codfish, etc. Every
      kind of civility and mark of respect is shewn them here, and if they don't leave us better
      satisfied than they came to us, it will not be our faults. From the little conversation I have
      had with them, which has been as much as could be got in a crowd, I presume they will. I am
      much pleased with them. Doctor Franklin, who[m] I never saw before, appears venerable in the
      characters of a gentleman, a physician, and statesman. I think Mr. Lynch very sensible and
      judicious, and all of them firmly attached to the good cause, and I flatter myself their zeal
      will not be abated by this visit ...</P>
   <P>Several armed vessels are fixing by the General, and we have passed a bill to encourage
      individuals to fix out others. We have just received an account that they have been
      cannonading Falmouth, Casco Bay, and that Wallace, the pirate at Newport, has insisted on the
      removal of the troops from Rhode Island, or he will destroy Newport, and shewn instructions to
      the Committee there to destroy four towns, among which are Plymouth and Machias. The others I
      can't learn. This account the Governour, Cooke, has just received. </P>

   <P>[Boston] 20 [October] </P>
   <P>Reports were now industriously spread that the Rebels would certainly soon attack Boston on
      all Sides; that great preparations were making up Mistick River, that in the Night time Boats
      were to come close along Shore by Dorchester Point, and crossing Gallows Creek enter the Town
      on that Side, where they thought it least defended. The Knowledge of the Rebels being very
      numerous in the Neighbourhood of Boston, and of their having collected some hundred of Whale
      Boats in the Rivers and at different parts of the Bay, perhaps made such Rumours be more
      attended to. Be that as it may; The Falcon hawled into the Creek as far as she could, and the
      Nautilus did the same at the mouth of the River leading to Mistick. Both these Sloops at that
      time were in a manner useless as Cruizers. The Nautilus had all her Rigging and Masts to
      examine; her Sails wanted mending, and the Vessel many Repairs, and had many sick people: The
      Falcon was rather in worse plight with respect to Sails and Rigging, having had a great deal
      of bad weather going to and coming from [New] Providence, but she was more considerably so in
      point of men, being upwards of twenty Seamen short of Complement besides near as many sick on
      board and at the Hospital. But although these Sloops were not then in a Condition to go to
      Sea, they were of Service in the Harbour while the Alarm of being attacked lasted: At' the
      same time they were employed in refitting, and their sick and fatigued people had time to
      recover. </P>

   <P>In pursuance of the order of yesterday, <name>Timothy Doughty</name>, a prisoner, being brought to the
      door, was called in. The letter from the chairman of the committee of Dutchess county, and all
      the affidavits and proofs against the said <name>Timothy Doughty</name> were read in his presence; and the
      said <name>Timothy Doughty</name> who declined a trial by the committee of the county where he resides, and
      put himself, as to all the charges against him, on this Congress, was fully heard in his
      denial of the charges against him; and his defence, and ordered to withdraw; and the Congress
      came to a determination thereon in the words following, to wit:</P>
   <P>In Provincial Congress, New-York, Oct. 20th, 1775.</P>
   <P>The Congress having taken the case of <name>Timothy Doughty</name>, now a prisoner before them, into their
      serious consideration, do determine, that notwithstanding his constant denial of the matters
      laid to his charge, they are of opinion that the said <name>Timothy Doughty</name> hath formerly
      entertained designs and opinions inimical to the great cause of American liberty, and been a
      principal instigator of the disturbances which have of late prevailed in the county of
      Dutchess, and that therefore he hath merited the hardships and sufferings which he hath
      sustained during his imprisonment. Nevertheless as he did continue in prison when he had an
      opportunity to escape, and did voluntarily repose himself upon the equity of this Congress,
      and hath farther promised that he will for the future demean himself in a peaceable and
      orderly manner, the Congress do resolveto acquit the said <name>Timothy Doughty</name> from any further
      punishment and recommend it to their constituents to receive him again as a member of the
      community. </P>
   <P>The said <name>Timothy Doughty</name> was thereupon called in and the determination of the Congress read to
      him, and by order of Congress a certified copy thereof was delivered to him, and he was
      thereupon discharged. </P>
   <P>Ordered, That another certified copy thereof be delivered to the chairman of the committee of

   <P>Mr. <name>Jonathan Lawrence</name> of the city of New-York, being highly recommended to this Congress for

      vigour, the fortifications erecting on the banks of Hudson's river in the Highlands, in this
      Colony, and that he is cheerfully willing to undertake that service: </P>
   <P>Ordered, That the said <name>Jonathan Lawrence</name> be appointed a commissioner for that purpose, in the

      which he received yesterday about noon from Mr.----, a young Gentlemen of character, who lives
      about 25 miles from the sea-side, viz That a transport vessel, from whence, or where bound,
      not certainly known, was on shore at Brigantine Beach, (about 60 miles from this city) on
      Tuesday afternoon last [October 17],2 that a Captain, Lieutenant and Serjeant, of regulars,
      had come to shore on the Beach, and offered a large sum in half johanneses to a man there, to
      put them on board a man of war, which they apprehended not to be far distant, which was
      refused. 3 </P>
   <P>At the same time several sailors came on shore, who said they had been pressed on board, and
      informed, that some barrels of gunpowder, with the small arms, were hove overboard, with some
      soldiers clothing; the vessel was left on a careen, with, the sand nearly up to her quarter
      deck:- The sailors left the beach, and come over to the main, when it is said, they took to
      the woods. </P>

   <P>Williamsburg, October 20.</P>
   <P>Yesterday the Committee of Safety received advice, by express, that two vessels had arrived in
      Hampton road with a reinforcement of soldiers for lord Dunmore, said to amount to about 200
      men. They are the troops which his lordship sent for to St. Augustine, and which, in our last,
      were said then to have arrived, some vessels having been seen coming in which were supposed to
      be those expected by lord Dunmore.</P>
   <P>Last wednesday [October 18] lord Dunmore, with 140 men, went upon an expedition to Kemp's
      landing, in Princess Anne county, about ten miles from Norfolk, in a number of boats, and one
      of the men of war's tenders. They landed at a place called Newtown, two miles below, about
      dusk, and immediately marched up to Kemp's, where they broke open a blacksmith's shop, and
      destroyed about 50 muskets, which he had to repair, then fell to pillaging a number of other
      houses, and, by some means or other, got into their possession two officers in the minute
      service, and four private men. The chief object of this notable expedition was to intercept a
      quantity of gunpowder lately imported, which luckily had been carried off some time before,
      and is now safely lodged, out of the reach of lord Dunmore, and all his gang. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Oct. 20, 1775.</P>
   <P>All our ports are shut up by the men of war, so that no vessel is allowed to go from one river
      to another. This day two vessels arrived here with a number of Soldiers. Not a day passes but
      they are searching for arms, ammunition, &amp;c. and have taken prisoners, and secured on
      board the ships, several Gentlemen whom they suspect to have been most active on the American
      side of the question. Most of the inhabitants have abandoned this town; most of the houses and
      shops are empty, and if there is not a speedy settlement, the whole of this Province must be
      ruined. </P>

   <P>Newbury Port Octor 21st 1775 -</P>
   <P>Reynell &amp; Coates</P>
   <P>I have now before me, your kind Letter of the 5th covering a Duplicate of what you wrote me p
      <name>Saml White</name> together with an Invoice of sundry Goods, ship'd me by his-Vessell, for which am
      obliged, &amp; shall carefully examine the Invoice, &amp; note the same to your Creditt - the
      Sail Makers Bill on the Industry, does not appear so extravagant as I at first imagin'd, &amp;
      the particulars afford me a Sattisfaction. I am much obliged to you, for the Sketch of my
      Account from your Books, by which I find your Advances on [William] Willcombs Cargoe exceed my
      Expectations, &amp; your kind Intentions to promote my Interest in this Adventure, are too
      conspicuous to admitt of a Doubt, in my Mind; &amp; I hope you have not as yet suffer'd in any
      Respect on my Acct rather than that should take Place, I would have you dispose of as much
      Molasses as will ballance your Acct &amp; from every Appearance I should wish to have the
      remainder lay in Store untill further Orders, unless you discover an Appearance of Danger of
      its being destroy'd by our unnatural Enemies, which God forbid: - I am very sensible that
      Large Quantities have been thrown into your City, but as it appears to me, our Commerce is now
      at an End, &amp; the Consumption of that Article is exceeding great &amp; of Course the Demand
      will soon run the Prices up to at least 2/-, If not, should our Affairs take a sudden turn, I
      should be glad to have that Molasses here, with which I could make a sure Profitt, before any
      fresh Importations from the Islands, could possibly take Place, as I am convinced there is not
      more than sufficient of that Article in this Colony, to answer the Demand of the ensuing Six
      Months, &amp; but very little expected; these Reasons convince me that it would be prudent to
      keep it for a Price. I am glad to hear of Willcombs Arrival in Falmouth, &amp; that he was
      design'd for Barcelona which should he arrive there, will afford a better Chance for obtaining
      a further Employ for the Vessell, or for the Sale of her, in some Parts of the Streights, than
      in England, &amp; I now imagine he will not return to you again, but pursue the Plan of
      freighting his Vessell untill he can dispose of her. - I am sorry to find the Underwriters
      with you, so averse to take on Pollicys, bound this Way, surely they have not an Idea of the
      Difficulties which will attend the Cruisers guarding this Coast; as they have no Harbour but
      Boston that they could presume to lay in; &amp; the boisterous Season is too great for them to
      keep at Sea; which induces me to think the Risque is not half so great as they imagine &amp; I
      really expected they would not have refus'd 12 PCt on the Dalton &amp; Cargoe but as the
      Capitall is large, &amp; the Prospect of her Voyage being able to afford a good Premium, I
      conclude to have the several Sums mention'd in my last, cover'd at 20 pCt if it cannot
      otherwise be done, but since I wrote you, I have seen an extract of a Letter from a young
      Gen[tlema]n who served Me 7 years in my Store, dated at Point Petre 15th Sept wherein he says,
      that Capt [Eleazer] Johnson was bound home, but that he could not sail from thence untill the
      first of Novr that the Season may be far advanc'd when he arriv'd on the Coast, which will
      bring him a Month Later than I at first imagin'd, tho' this [Fact] is agreable to what I wrote
      him under 2d Augt which Letter suppos'd must have got to hand. - I am glad to find Willcomb
      laid in so largely of Provisions, as that Article must be scarce &amp; high all over Europe. -
      I observe the Reason for Willcombs taking from you so much Money, which is obvious to me. My
      Brother [Samuel] White is yet detain'd in Boston &amp; no Prospect of his getting out, as all
      Communication is Stopp'd on both Sides, but now &amp; then, a few run away in Boats in the
      Night; I find he lias sold his Cargoe &amp; obtain'd the Money. The unexpected Advance on
      Bills on London, have induc'd me to inclose you a Dr'ft for £ 300 sterling, that if you sh'd
      have Occasion to advance the Premium on the Dalton, I would not intrude too much on your
      Goodness of which I have had repeated Instances, or if you should not have Occasion to make
      that Use of the Money, it will serve to Lessen the Sum you are already in Advance for me. This
      Sett was sent to Boston for Sale, when the unhappy Battle of Lexington commenced, wch caused
      such Confusion that no Person was willing to purchase, it has therefore remain'd a Blank ever
      since, not having had Occasion to make Use of it, my Friends in London are appriz'd of its
      Date, &amp; you may with Safety indorse it, &amp; the next Post will hand you the second &amp;
      Third of the Sett: -</P>
   <P>Since Willcomb sail'd, I had a Brig arrived at Baltimore from the West Indies with a Load of
      Molasses, which neated me there 21d Currency, free of every Charge even the Duties, &amp; she
      took in 7,000 Bushells Wheat a 5/3, &amp; saild for Falmouth the 6th Sept consign'd to my
      Friends Champion Dickason &amp; Co of London; should she arrive in Safety, I doubt not of a
      fortunate Adventure in her, as the Crops in Europe have fallen very short - I am sorry to find
      a Prospect of a Prohibition on Provisions with you, as we plac'd much Dependence on the
      Severity of our Winters to have bro't in large Quantities of Flour into this Province, a Plan
      for which, has been in Contemplation by a few of my Acquaintance, to Join in a Compy &amp; to
      take up, abt 6 fishing Schooners, prime Sailors, to proceed in Rotation, either to
      Philadelphia or Baltimore as the Risque to eithe:-Place may appear lest, &amp; to continue all
      Winter, by which Means we were in Hopes of collecting f[ro]m 6 to 10,000 Barrells before March
      expir'd, the Profitts on which, would be very handsome, add to which it wd greatly serve the
      Inhabitants of this Part of the Colony, w'ho will certainly want that Article very much before
      the Spring opens, but from the Hint you gave me, we must at present put a Stop to our
      Proceedings until! we can have further Advice, relative to this Matter; Should the
      underwriters appear backward in taking a Risque on Johnson at 20 pCt you may venture a little
      higher rather than not have it done, as her Voyage will afford a 50 pCt Premium, but this sub
      Rosa - therefore in Hopes of soon hearing from you, that this matter is finish'd to
      Sattisfaction, I subscribe myself, with Wishes of Health &amp; a peaceable Enjoyment of our
      Possessions Your esteem'd Friend </P>

   <P>Gentlemen</P>
   <P>Cambridge October 21st 1775</P>
   <P>Your Application to me by Messrs [Samuel] Dyre, [John] Jepson, and [John] Malbone engaged my
      utmost Attention; and I embraced the Opportunity of taking the Advice of a Committee of the
      Honble the Continental Congress, now sitting here, upon the important subject of it. They
      unanimously gave their Opinion that the Inhabitants of Newport should supply the Ships of War
      with Beer and fresh Provisions as usual provided Wallace complies with the Terms he hath
      offered; and that the Troops should be removed out of the Town. They are also unanimously of
      Opinion that the Troops ought to remain on the Island. I have written to this Effect to
      General Hopkins; and have also submitted to him to remove the Troops at a greater Distance
      from the Town if he shall think the Service will not suffer by it.</P>
   <P>I am also to inform you that an Express arrived Yesterday at Head Quarters from Portsmouth,
      advising that on Tuesday last [October 17] a Naval Force supposed to be the Fleet from Boston
      consisting of one 64, One 20, Two 18 with a Bomb-Ketch or Two and a large Transport or Two
      full of Men appeared off Falmouth Casco-bay and demanded of the Inhabitants that they should
      deliver up their Arms &amp; give Hostages for their future good Behavior. Upon Condition of
      this Delivery of Part of them the same Evening he gave them to the next Day to consider of the
      Proposal. They accordingly delivered him 8 Muskets. He showed the Committee his Orders which
      were positive to destroy the Town, and also the Town of Portsmouth, in Case they should refuse
      to comply with the Terms offered. A very heavy Cannonading was heard the next Day at Falmouth.
      I give you this Information that you may consider what Probability there is of your being
      treated in a similar Manner. I am, Gentlemen, &amp;c.</P>

   <P>Sir, -</P>
   <P>Cambridge, October 21st, 1775</P>
   <P>Messrs. <name>S. Dyre</name>, <name>J. Jepson</name>, and <name>J. Malbone</name>, have waited upon me with a Memorial from the Town
      Council of Newport, setting forth the deep distresses of that town, and pressing in the
      strongest terms for the removal of the troops. I laid the application before the Committee of
      the Continental Congress, now sitting here, who unanimously gave their advice that the
      inhabitants should supply Wallace with beer and fresh provisions for the use of the ships, as
      usual, upon his complying with the terms offered on his part; and that the troops should be
      kept out of the town of Newport. They were, also, unanimously of opinion that the troops
      should remain on the island. I accordingly recommend to you to keep the troops out of the town
      so long as Wallace shall keep his promise, and make no attempt upon it. As the inhabitants are
      under the greatest anxiety, I submit it to your judgment whether or no't it will be consistent
      with the service and prudent to remove the troops to a further distance from the town. If it
      can be done with safety, I recommend it in order to quiet the minds of the people.</P>
   <P>An express came to General Washington, yesterday, from Portsmouth, with advice that a naval
      force from Boston had appeared off Falmouth, Casco Bay, and demanded of the inhabitants the
      surrender of their arms and hostages for their future good behaviour. He offered, upon their
      delivering up part of their arins the same evening, to allow them to the next day to consider
      of the demands. They accordingly delivered him eight muskets. The next day a very heavy firing
      was heard upon Falmouth. The commander of the fleet showed his orders to the committee; which
      were to destroy the town, and Portsmouth, in case they should refuse to comply with the
      demand. To me it appears highly probable that Newport and the other sea-port towns, may soon
      expect a similar treatment. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Tionderoga October 21st. 1775.</P>
   <P>At four O'Clock this Afternoon I had the Honour to receive your Letter of the 12th
      Instant.</P>
   <P>I should have been extreamly happy, If Congress had been in Sentiment with me on the Necessity
      of a Delegation from that respectable Body to this Place, a Necessity which to me appears to
      be absolute.</P>
   <P>A General Sir, who commands an Army in which Discipline and Subordination is established and
      prevails, and every Corps of which considers Itself under his immediate Command, can devote
      the greatest Proportion of his Time uninterruptedly to weigh every Measure that It may be
      necessary for him to pursue in Order to compleat the Wishes of his Superiors; Unfortunately
      for me I have seldom, very seldom indeed had half an Hour to Myself in any Period of this
      Campaign. Judge of my Situation at this Moment; General [David] Worster's Regiment detained
      here for three Days by violent Gales and heavy Rains, are now in Doubt whether they will
      proceed to the Army at <name>St Johns</name>, The General's Secretary and his Chaplain inform me, that many
      of the Officers &amp; most of the Men, apprehend being detained in Canada all Winter; that
      they may be pre vented by Frost from returning; that they will perish with Cold or Sickness;
      that if the Army should be under the Necessity of retreating from <name>St Johns</name>, many must fall a
      Sacrifice to the Enemy, as there will not be Boats suffici[ent] to bring them away, (altho' we
      really have Craft sufficient for a Thousand more than the Army consists of); That none but the
      General, his Secre[tary] and Champlain have any Inclination to proceed.</P>
   <P>The Weather is now clearing, the Wind favourable and I wait in the most distressing Anxiety
      for the Morrow, to see the Event.</P>
   <P>I shall dispatch a Copy of your Letter to General Montgomery, for him to Execute such of the
      Orders It contains as relate to the Affairs of Canada &amp;c. I am happy that Congress has so
      just a Sense of that Gentleman's Abilities and Zeal his being in this Army has been the Source
      of vas[t] Consolation to me. I hope his Health will be continued to him that he may be enabled
      to support that Variety of Fatigue both of Mind and Body to which he is every moment exposed. </P>
   <P>Were it possible to foresee the Result of our Operations at <name>St Johns</name>, I should be able to
      determine if it was necessary to build any Vesse[ls] of War on Lake Champlain, at present I am
      at a Loss what to do, but least any Detrimen[t] should arise to the Public from the Dilemma
      [I] am In, If it is the Intention of Congress to prepare Timber for constructing such Vessels
      without waiting the Event of our Operations, the Difference of Time it will take in, my
      sending t[o] New York for Carpenters or Congress sending ther[e] on Receipt of this and
      ordering them up, cannot be much, permit me however to observe that all that can be done this
      Fall will be to hew the Timber and prepare Roads to draw It out in Winter, so that the
      Shipwrights may begin their Work in April, I say this is all that can be done, for no Plank
      are to be had here, &amp; if there was, Winter is so severe in this Latitude that no Building
      could be carried on. </P>
   <P>If the Tun of Powder mentioned in Your Letter should be sent here, it will be vastly short of
      what this Garrison and <name>Fort George</name> ought to have should we be unfortunate at <name>St Johns</name>. -
      Should we succeed, a vastly greater Quantity will be wanted in Canada. - </P>
   <P>Congress mentions a Garrison for Crown Point, I suppose that is founded on a Supposition that
      there is a Fortification at that Place, Whereas in Fact there is none. It may be possible this
      Fall to enclose the Barracks with a Pickett, but that is the most that can be done. And very
      much is wanted here, more (unless Canada should be ours) than can be at any Rate compleated
      this Campaign. 2 </P>

      information what was done with the money, and what contract was made for importing the
      articles mentioned in that order.</P>
   <P>The Congress was then informed by Mr. <name>Van Zandt</name>, that the £4,000 is sent out on the account
      and risk of the Provincial Congress, and whatever profits arise on said goods the Congress are
      to have the benefit of; that a vessel is chartered by Messrs. <name>Jacobus <name>Van Zandt</name></name>, <name>Henry Remsen</name>
      and <name>Lewis Pintard</name>, to go to sundry places to obtain those goods for the sum of £550 sterling,
      payable on delivery of the said goods in any place within particular limits for that purpose
      mentioned in the charter party; but that in case of her being seized or taken on her voyage
      the owner of the vessel is to receive £300 sterling for her; that the vessel is to lay 40
      working days to receive her cargo, after which she is to receive 40s per day demurrage; that
      whatever room may be in the vessel after the goods ordered by the freighters for the benefit

   <P>[Philadelphia] October 21, 1775</P>
   <P>Saturday. Zubly. We can't do without powder, intelligence, drugs. Georgia must have an Indian
      war, if they can't supply the Indians. The Creeks and Cherokees are in our Province; we must
      have Indian trade. Four millions have been spent in six months. We have been successful, but
      we have gained little; all the power of Great Britain, it is true, has gained very little. New
      England has been at great expense, so has New York; Pennsylvania has spent. a hundred thousand
      pounds of their money, to fortify their river; Virginia as much; North Carolina a great deal;
      South Carolina have issued a million. Eighteen millions of dollars is an enormous sum of
      money; whenever your money fails you fail too. We are to pay six millions now, twelve millions
      more presently, and have no trade. I would bear the character of a madman, or that of an
      emissary of Lord North, rather than believe it possible to pay eighteen millions of dollars
      without trade. Can we make bricks without straw? We can live upon acorns; but will we? </P>
   <P>Wythe . . . Commerce, whether we consider it in an economical, a moral, or political light,
      appears to be a great good; civility and charity, as well as knowledge, are promoted by it.
      The auri sacra fames is a fine subject for philosophers and orators to display themselves
      upon; but the abuse of a thing is not an argument against it. If the gentleman was possessed
      of the philosopher's stone, or Fortunatus's cap, would he not oblige the continent with the
      use of it? Why should not America have a navy? No maritime power near the sea-coast can be
      safe without it. It is no chimera. The Romans suddenly built one in their Carthaginian war.
      Why may not we lay a foundation for it? We abound with firs, iron ore, tar, pitch, turpentine;
      we have all the materials for construction of a navy. No country exceeds us in felicity of
      climate or fertility of soil. America is one of the wings upon which the British eagle has
      soared to the skies. I am sanguine and enthusiastical enough to wish and to hope that it will
      be sung, that America inter nubila condit. </P>
   <P>British navy will never be able to effect our destruction. Before the days of Minos, nations
      round the Archipelago carried on piratical wars. The Moors carry on such wars now, but the
      pillars of Hercules are their ne plus ultra. We are too far off for Britain to carry on a
      piratical war. We shall, sometime or other, rise, superior to all the difficulties they may
      throw in our way. I wont say, there is none that doeth good in Britain, no, not one; but I
      will say, she has not righteous persons enough to save their State. They hold those things
      honorable which please them, and those for just which profit them. I know of no instance where
      a Colony has revolted, and a foreign nation has interposed to subdue them; but many to the
      contrary. If France and Spain should furnish ships and soldiers, England must pay them. Where
      are her finances? Why should we divert our people from commerce, and banish our seamen? Our
      petition may be declared to be received graciously, and promised to be laid before Parliament,
      but we can expect no success from it. Have they ever condescended to take notice of you?
      Rapine, depopulation, burning, murder. Turn your eyes to Concord, Lexington, Charlestown,
      Bristol, New York; there you see the character of Ministry and Parliament. We shall distress
      our enemies by stopping trade; granted. But how will the small quantities we shall be able to
      export supply our enemies? Tricks may be practised. If desire of gain prevails with merchants,
      so does caution against risks. </P>
   <P>Gadsden. I wish we could keep to a point. I have heard the two gentlemen with a great deal of
      pleasure. I have argued for opening our ports, but am for shutting them until we hear the
      event of our petition to the King, and longer until Congress shall determine otherwise. I am
      for a navy too, and I think that shutting our ports for a time will help us to a navy. If we
      leave our ports open, warm men will have their ships seized and moderate ones will be favored. </P>
   <P>Lee. When you hoist out a glimmering of hope that the people are to be furnished from abroad,
      you give a check to your own manufactures. </P>
   <P>Chase. A glove has been offered by the gentleman from Georgia, and beg leave to discharge my
      promise to that gentleman, to answer his arguments. My position was this; that the gentleman's
      system would end in the total destruction of American liberty. I never shall dispute
      self-evident propositions. </P>
   <P>The present state of things requires reconciliation or means to carry on war. Intelligence we
      must have; we must have powder and shot; we must support the credit of our money. You must
      have a navy to carry on the war. You can't have a navy says the gentleman. What is the
      consequence? I say, that we must submit. Great Britain, with twenty ships, can destroy all our
      trade, and ravage our seacoast; can block up all your harbors, prevent your getting powder.
      What is the consequence? That we should submit. You can't trade with nobody; you must trade
      with somebody; you can't trade with anybody but Great Britain, therefore, I say, we must
      submit. We can't trade with foreigners, the gentleman said. The whole train of his reasoning
      proved that we must break our whole association, as to exports and imports. If we trade with
      Great Britain, will she furnish us with powder and arms? Our exports are about three millions;
      would Britain permit us to export to her, and receive cash in return? It would impoverish and
      ruin Great Britain. They will never permit a trade on our side, without a trade on theirs.
      Gentlemen from New York would not permit tobacco and naval stores to be sent to Great Britain;
      nothing that will support their naval power or revenue. But will not this break the Union?
      Would three Colonies stop their staple when the other Colonies exported theirs? Fifteen
      hundred seamen are employed by the tobacco Colonies - one hundred and twenty-five sail of
      British ships; but you may drop your staple, your tobacco; but it is difficult to alter old
      habits. We have a great number of female slaves that are best employed about tobacco. North
      Carolina cannot, will not, give up their staple. The gentleman frorri Georgia was for trading
      with Great Britain and all the world. He says we can't trade with any nation but Britain
      therefore we must trade with Britain alone. What trade shall we have, if we exclude Britain,
      Ireland, West Indies, British and foreign? Eastern Provinces might carry it on with a small
      fleet, if their harbors were fortified. Southern Colonies cannot. Eastern Colonies can't carry
      on their trade to that extent, without a naval power to protect them, not only on the coast,
      but on the ocean, and to the port of their destination. The same force that would assist the
      Eastern Colonies, would be of little service to us in summer time; it must be a small, narrow,
      and limited trade. </P>
   <P>The best instrument we have, is our opposition by commerce. If we take into consideration
      Great Britain in all her glory; Commons voted eighteen, twenty millions last war; eighty
      thousand seamen, from her trade alone; her strength is all artificial, from her trade alone.
      Imports from Great Britain to the United Colonies are three millions per annum; fifteen
      millions to all the world; one fifth; three quarters is British manufactures. A thousand
      British vessels are employed in American trade; twelve thousand sailors; all out of employ.
      What a stroke! don't take into view Ireland or West Indies. Colonies generally indebted about
      one year's importation; the revenue of tobacco alone half a million, if paid. North Britain
      enter less than the quantity, and don't pay what they bought; it employs a great number of
      manufacturers; reexported abroad, is a million; it is more. Eighty. thousand hogsheads are
      reexported, and it pays British debts. The re-export employs ships, sailors, freight,
      commissions, insurance. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Philadelphia Octr 21st 1775</P>
   <P>my dear Col. I received your Letter with great pleasure, tho contrary to your expectation it
      paid postage to the hated Post office. as the constitutional post now goes regularly, we may
      with a safe conscience say how d'ye to each other. It gives me concern to hear that you are
      withdrawing from public business; upon my word, this is not a time for men of abilities with
      good intentions to be only spectators, if we cant do all. the good we cou'd wish, let us at
      least endeavour to prevent all the mischief in our power. Your good friend <name>Ld Dunmore</name> is
      endeavouring to raise all the powers on earth to demolish poor Virginia. We have advice, that
      at his earnest sollicitation a fleet may be expected this fall to ravage our defenceless
      plantations &amp; burn our little Towns, And we have lately discover'd a plot of his &amp;
      [John] Connolly's, which is to be executed in the following manner. Conolly despairing of
      getting up the Country through Virga or the Carolina's, is to go to St Augustine from thence
      to the Creeks &amp; Cherokees, and through all the tribes to Detroit, by general [Thomas]
      Gage's commission he is to have the Garrison &amp; Cannon of that place, &amp; the assistance
      of the french at that settlement with all these he is to form an army in the spring, &amp;
      march to Pittsburgh, from thence to Alexandria, proclaiming freedom to all servants that will
      enlist; there he is to be joined by Dunmore with the fleet &amp; troops from England &amp;
      march through the Country . . . We have given the earliest intelligence of these schemes to
      our Com. of safety, &amp; hope with their endeavours assisted by the Carolinas &amp; Georgia,
      that Conolly may be intercepted this fall or winter. Our military operations this campaign
      have been very languid from the want of powder, but we still hope our success in Canada will
      be such, as to cut a figure for the first essay, such measures have been taken, as give us
      good reason to expect a plentifull supply of that necessary article before the next spring,
      and then we shall be in readiness to receive the very warm attack, which from all our advices,
      the Ministry are preparing for us, but least then we shou'd fail in being supply'd from
      abroad, every man shou'd exert himself in making saltpetre. Your several plantations wou'd
      furnish a good deal &amp; you know the process is easy. with plenty of powder the Victory is
      surely ours. -</P>

   <P>[Endorsed] Account of Stores &amp;c on board the Several Gondolas by Robt Towers, Commis. </P>
   <P>1. Pa. Arch.</P>
   <P>2. The date is approximated. Instructions to supply certain military stores to all thirteen
      gondolas were issued by the Committee of Safety to Commissary Towers on October 11, 1775. Each
      gondola lists fifteen cutlasses, and the Committee of Safety records the purchase, on October
      20, of 195 cutlasses. None of the gondolas, according to the foregoing returns, carried any
      muskets, and the Committee minutes for October 23 report the delivery of various quantities of
      firelocks to each gondola. Hence, the return would have been made on either October 21 or 22,
      and, as the latter date was Sunday, it is probable that Towers' report was prepared on
      Saturday, October 21. </P>
   <P>Dixon AND HuNTER's <name>Virginia Gazette</name>, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1775 </P>
   <P>Williamsburg, October 21.</P>
   <P>Some time last week Lord Dunmore was alarmed with information that 19 pieces of cannon were
      fitted up, and would be soon placed on the wharves, &amp;c. in Norfolk, to annoy the ships of
      war, and that a number of men were daily expected from Williamsburg, who were to fire them
      from behind hogsheads filled with sand. Yesterday se'nnight [October 13], in consequence of
      the above intelligence, his Lordship sent ashore a party of soldiers, under command of two
      officers, who marched through Norfolk to the place where the cannon were, destroyed 17 of
      them, and carried off two for their own use, without molestation. The above cannon we are
      confident were never intended for such a purpose; on the contrary, they belonged to sundry
      private Gentlemen, who had them removed there for safety. </P>
   <P>Two companies of regulars are just arrived, viz: Capt. <name>John Fleming</name>'s from Henrico, and Capt.
      <name>Robert Ballard</name>'s from Mecklenburg. </P>
   <P>We hear from Norfolk, that Capt. Matthews, of the Norfolk minute-men, Mr. <name>William Robinson</name> and
      Mr. <name>John Hancock</name>, have been taken prisoners by Lord Dunmore, but for what we cannot learn. </P>
   <P>A large sloop from St. Eustatia, mounting 16 six pounders and a number of swivels, is said to
      be gone up the bay with a large quantity of gunpowder. Mr. [John] Goodrich of Portsmouth,
      whose vessel Lord Dunmore suspects of having brought in a supply of that article lately, is
      confined in irons on board a man of war. </P>
   <P>NARRATIVE OF CAPTAIN <name>JOHN SELMAN</name> 1</P>
   <P>[Beverly, October 22, 1775]</P>
   <P>At Cambridge I was ordered by Gen'l Washington to take the command of a detachment of said
      army and proceed on board the Schooner Franklin, on the 16th October 1775 his instructions and
      additional instructions, I send you a true copy of them. Before we sailed from Beverly I think
      it was a Mr. Morris [<name>Stephen Moylan</name>] an aid to Gen'l Washington came to me and asked for those
      instructions that he might see them, which I had receivd and was sealed and on the
      subscription p[a]rt was wrote (not to be opened till out of sight of land) I delivered them
      into his hand he immediately returned them to me, he had the same interview with Commodore
      Broughton, I believe in the same way. I remark on this that General Washington might be
      suspicious, this being the first enterprise of this nature with sealed orders, might start the
      mind, but the horrors of death in all its forms would not have opperated to have broke a seal
      or denyed a duty 2 - as to the time of sailing from Beverly I cannot say positively but I
      believe the 20th or 21st October. 3 </P>

   <P>1. You being already appointed a Captain in the Army of the United Colonies of North America,
      are hereby directed to take the Command of a Detachment of said Army and proceed on board the
      army schooner Harrison; lately fitted out and equipped with Arms, Ammunition and Provisions at
      the Continental Expence.</P>
   <P>2. You are to proceed as Commander of said Schooner immediately on a Cruize against such
      Vessels as may be found on the High Seas or elswhere bound inwards or outwards to or from
      Boston in the Service of the ministerial Army and to take and Seize all such Vessels laden
      with Soldiers, Arms, Ammunition or Provisions for or from said Army or which you shall have
      good Reason to suspect are in such Service.</P>
   <P>3. If you should be so Successful as to take any of said Vessels you are immediately to send

      farther directions.</P>
   <P>4. You are to be very particular and diligent in your Search after all Letters or other Papers
      tending to discover the Designs of the Enemy or of any other Kind and to forward all such to

      Consistent with your own Safety; their pri[mutilated] after being duly Searched, and when they

      Stationed at Such Port for a Guard to bring them up to Head Quarters. </P>
   <P>6. For your own encouragement and that of the other Officers and Men to Activity and Courage
      in this Service over and above your Pay in the Continental Army you shall be intitled to one
      third Part of the Cargo of every Vessel by you taken and sent into Port (military and naval
      Stores only excepted, which the Vessels and Apparel are reserved for the Public Service),

   <P>Agreed that the General Court ought properly to take Cognizance of all armed Vessels fitted
      out by Individuals in this Province &amp; that Commissions should be granted in such Cases; at
      least that Captures be made under some Authority. That Captures made by armed Vessels in the

   <P>We have just heard that the pirates on the Eastern shore have destroyed two-thirds of Falmouth
      burnt down, and have orders to destroy every sea port from Boston to Pemmaquid. This is savage
      and barbarous in the highest stage. What can we wait for now? What more can we want to
      justifie any step to take, kill and destroy, to refuse them any refreshments, to apprehend our
      enemies, to confiscate their goods and estates, to open our ports to foreigners, and if
      practicable to form alliances, etc., etc.</P>
   <P>I shall endeavour to see and form a judgment of your plan as soon as I can procure the chart.
      The row gallies you have at Philadelphia may be very serviceable in smooth water, but if I am
      rightly informed would not do in a sea. No doubt such might be constructed as would, but I am
      inclined to think that our cannon armed Vessels, especially as we can be so superiour in men,
      and are more used to them, will answer the purpose better, if we choose such as sail well. </P>

   <title>NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL <name>SAMUEL GRAVES</name> 1</title>
   <P>[Boston] 22 [October]</P>
   <P>The Admiral received a Letter from Captain [James] Wallace acquainting him that the Viper,
      Bolton, two Transports, a Schooner for Virginia and a Packet for New York arrived at Rhode
      Island the 4th instant; that the Viper, Schooner and <name>Charlotte Packuet</name> sailed immediately for
      New York; that he had engaged a Quantity of Stock for the Transports, and notwithstanding the
      Rebel Governor [Nicholas] Cooke of Providence sent down 1500 men to prevent it he had got some
      off. He also acquainted the Admiral with his firing upon the Town of Bristol, and with his
      Endeavours to remove the Rebels in Arms from Rhode Island; that there was not an Island round
      him but had two or three hundred men under arms to defend it; &amp; that the people were
      vigilant, some of them coming 50 miles upon an Alarm; but that there was plenty of provision
      to be got with a sufficient force; that he had ha,d no regular Supply from the Contract[or]
      for 4 months past, and that if he could not settle some terms with the Town, he must depend
      upon ravaging the Country for Supplies. </P>
   <P>Captain Wallace in another Letter acknowledged the Receipt of the Admirals Order of the 17th
      of September to burn, sink and destroy; and of other Orders. </P>
   <P>Several two decked Ships and Frigates having by the admiralty been ordered to America, some of
      which it was imagined must very soon arrive, and perhaps be already at Halifax, the Admiral
      now gave leave for the Somerset to return fr[om] thence to England; but he en joined Captain
      <name>Le Cras</name> on his sailing from that Port, to leave all his Marines, and as many Seamen and Stores
      behind as he could spare. </P>
   <P>Never had Ships been more eagerly wished for than at this period to intercept the Rebels
      outward and homeward bound Vessels, who were carrying on a most pernicious Traffic with the
      French and Dutch, injurious to the Kings Service in America and beneficial to themselves by
      bringing in not only Arms and Ammunition, but other Articles of equal importance to them, and
      without which they could not keep an Army together, nor of Course continue the War. The few
      Ships with the Admiral were continually on Service either cruizing or with Convoys, their
      coming into Harbour even was no relaxation, for, if not immediately hurried out again and
      abridged of time to take in their provisions and Stores, a part of their men was generally
      lent to other Ships, and the rest were sure of a great deal of Employment in Boats. So urgent
      were the Kings affairs and so inadequate had been the force to that time in America that it
      was worn down by Excess of Duty and Hardship. The following List contains the Additions to and
      Decrease of the Squadron since the arrival of the Nautilus and Falcon a few days before the
      Battle of Lexington </P>

   <P>Of these the Otter was sent to Virginia, The Scorpion as soon as she could be caulked and
      refitted sailed for North Carolina The Viper went to New York, And the Raven remained in
      Nantasket until the following Month, when she was ordered to Georgia. The Merlin, Senegal and
      Cerberus therefore were the only Vessels of those abovementioned that were of Service in the
      joint operations of the Squadron and Army at Boston. </P>
   <P>The Condition in which the Scorpion and Viper arrived is partly described in their Captains
      Letters to the Admiral; hitherto almost all the small Ships and Sloops that came from England
      had been in want of men, caulking, and repairs. </P>
   <P>All the Sailmakers that could be got were now employed in repairing old and making new Sails
      for the Nautilus and Falcon; as by reason of the Demands coming for these and other Stores
      from the Ships at Rhode Island, and the Swan being lately arrived in a manner destitute, the
      Storeship could not furnish Sails enough, nor indeed many other articles that were wanted. </P>
   <P>The Admiral at this time not only ordered what Stores and Tackle had been requested for the
      Ships at Rhode Island to be supplied, but also directed a further quantity of the most useful
      Articles; to the end that those Ships might be able to maintain that important Post all the
      Winter: And the Swan was ordered to be caulked, victualled and stored with the utmost
      expedition that she might return to Rhode Island as soon as possible, &amp; convoy the
      transports going with these supplies. </P>

   <P>New-York, October 22, 1775.</P>
   <P>The Viper, sloop-of-war, has aped the piratical conduct of the Ministerial ships to the
      eastward, by taking several of our vessels, inward bound, without so much as the least colour
      of their having violated any of the acts of trade. Nothing can more clearly manifest the
      absurdity and injustice of the present measures against this distressed Country, than the
      violations of those acts which they contend ought to bind the Americans, and which they come
      to enforce against them by every artifice their wicked hearts can suggest. Will a God of
      justice suffer such matchless wickedness to pass with impunity? Surely he will not. </P>

   <P>Since I wrote your Lordship we have not been altogether inactive, for on the 15th Instant, I
      landed with between 70 and 80 Men (which was all we could Spare to take with us) some little
      distance from this in the Night, and Marched about a Mile and a half up the Country, where we
      destroyed 17 pieces of Ordinance and brought of[f] two more, that the Rebels had carried from
      the Town of Norfolk, and concealed there. On the 17th we landed again about eight Miles from
      this and Marched between two and three Miles up the Country where I had information of a
      Number of more Guns, and here they had collected about 200 of their Shirt men, who all fled to
      the Woods, and at this place we found some Small Arms and Ammunition, but could not find the
      Guns. On the 19th We landed again and Marched about two Miles up the Country, and there
      destroyed Ten Guns, and brought off Six. On the 20th we landed again and brought off Six more
      Guns, and Yesterday we landed again and brought off Ten Guns and Two Cohorns, and between
      fifty and Sixty small Arms and a great quantity of Ball of all Sorts and Sizes, which I
      believe is all the Military Stores in this Neighbourhood that could be of any Service to the
      Rebels; I should do manifest injustice to our little Corps if I did not inform your Lordship,
      that upon all these occasions both Officers and Soldiers behaved with that order and Spirit
      that does them honor; I can assure your Lordship that landing in this manner has discouraged
      exceedingly the Rebels, and has raised the Spirits of the friends of Government so much that
      they are offering their Services from all quarters; on one of the expeditions there were Seven
      prisoners taken of which Number I have detained two, the one is the Delegate [William]
      Robinson, the other is a certain Captn [Thomas] Mathews of the Minute men, whose examination I
      herewith send your Lordship. (No 2).</P>
   <P>In my letter No. 32, I informed your Lordship of the situation of the Town of Hampton, the
      place of residence of His Majesty's Officers of the Customs of the lower district of James
      River, but the Rebels as I informed your Lordship had possession of it and would not permit
      the Merchants, or Masters of Vessells, either to enter or Clear out; finding that the Custom
      House Officers were not permitted to do business there I ordered them by letter to move
      immediately to this place, where they would be protected by the Men of War, Mr Mitchel the
      Collector with his books and papers made his escape in the Night and Arrived here Yesterday in
      the Morning; Mr [Wilson Miles] Cary the Naval Officer declares he is an Officer belonging to
      the Country and not to the Crown, the other Mr Bradley the Comptroller I expect will come if
      he can make his escape, if Mr Carey or his Deputy does not come I shall appoint another in his

   <P>. . . An Express arrived from Casco Bay last Evening that brings an account that the Enemy had
      been firing a Day or two upon Falmouth what has been the consequence we have not yet learnt,
      the Enimy had orders to burn Falmouth and Portsmouth unless the Inhabitants would deliver up
      their Arms and give Hostages for their future good behavior - The Enemys' conduct fulfills the
      Scripture &quot;Whose tender Mercies are Cruelties&quot; Will not this brutal conduct rouse a
      spirit of Indignation throughout America - Such a shocking scene as was Exhibited at Bristol
      you cannot conceive of - The People of Newport are all moveing into the Country - The Night
      after Wallace returned from Bristol the confusion in Newport was near equal to what it was
      there - The Inhabitants Carted out there Goods and furniture and stord them in Barns &amp; out
      Houses all about the Island, they must sustain very great losses from the confusion and
      disorder the Goods were mov'd in - Capt Escek Hopkins commands a party of about two hundred
      men Stationed there by order of Govenor Cook <name>Capt Wallace</name> has made the Inhabitants the
      following proposition if they will supply his Vessels with fresh Provisions Beer &amp;[c] and
      remove the Troop off the Island he will spare the Town, but if they dont comply with these
      conditions he has positive Orders to lay the Town in Ashes, which he is determined to execute
      What will be the Event God only knows -There is a Committee from Newport down here to see
      Govenor Cook to get an Order for the Removal of the Troops and Liberty to furnish the Ships
      with fresh Provisions - The Committee are Capt <name>John Jepson</name> Mr <name>John Malbone</name> &amp; <name>Sam Dyer</name> Esqr
      - The matter was laid before the Continental Committee who advisd to furnishing the Ships with
      fresh Provisions, but not to remove the Troops off the Islands - Which I suppose will take
      place Accordingly - But there appears a strange hobble in our Gait, here we are at Loggerheads
      at other places only Sparring and others again in perfect Tranquillity - Here we are cuting
      them off from geting fresh Provisions and removing the Stock from the Islands which amounts to
      an entire Depopulation - While at New-york, Philadelphia and many other parts of America their
      Ships are supplied with every thing they stand in Need on and live in the midst of peace and
      plenty - If we are to be cons'ider'd as one People and they as a common Enimy upon what
      Principles are they so differently treated in different Governments - 0 ! could the
      Continental Congress behold the distreses and wretched condition of the poor Inhabitants
      driven from the Seaport Towns, it must, it would kindle a blaze of Indignation against those
      Commisiond Pirates and Licensed Robbers - that they would find no rest or Abideing Place in

   <P>The followg is an Account of the Manner which the Cannon &amp; Spare Arms were taken from Fort
      Pownall on the 14th April '75 by an Order from <name>Genl Gage</name>, directed to <name>Thos Goldthwait Esq</name>
      Commander of said Fort.</P>
   <P>On Friday Eveng the 13th Apl, came into penobscott river a Top sail Schooner which Anchor'd
      near Fort Pownall, which myself and others took to be a Merchantman going up the River to
      purchase Lumber - and early next Morng we saw Another Schooner which came too &amp; Anchord
      near the Former. soon after came ashore some Sailors from the first mentiond Vessel to beg
      some Milk for their Breakfast's and said they were going up the River to get lumber -
      presently after came on Shore an Officer who enquir'd for the Commander of the Fort and on
      seeing him presented an Order from <name>Genl Gage</name>, for the Cannon &amp; spare Arms he then return'd
      on board and immediately appeard a large Number of Soldiers on the Deck, (which before was not
      seen) who directly got into Boats and came ashore &amp; March'd into the Fort and went to work
      in Getting out the Cannon &amp;c wch was carry'd on board - I am Convinc'd at that time 'twas
      not in Colo. Goldthwait's power to have resisted them, with the least Degree of Success -
      having only 6 or 8 Men in the Fort and but half a Barrl powder which the Gunner show me in the
      Magazine - I further declare that I remain'd at said Fort 'till the news came of the Battle at
      Lexington - immediately on which (tho' late at Night) <name>Colo Goldthwait</name> dispatch'd a Number of
      Men in his Barge to go 20 Miles up the River and advise the people of the News - and recommend
      to them, to immediately Call a Meeting, to consider what was most Eligable to be done - the
      Meeting was accordingly hel'd the 6 day of May when <name>Colo Goldthwait</name> presided as Moderator
      thereof. - I attended the Meeting myself, and found, that after <name>Colo Goldthwait</name>'s Conduct was
      represented to them, that they were Universally satisfy'd wch they manafested by a General
      Vote - during the whole of the above transactions I was at the Fort, and look'd on Colo
      Goldthwait to be a Strong Advocate for the Liberties of his Country </P>
   <P>W Molineux </P>
   <P>the above if requir'd, am ready to make Oath to</P>
   <P>I would further add, that the Officers which Commanded the party, said that if <name>Colo G</name>'t
      refus'd delivering the above Cannon &amp;c. 'twas his Orders to destroy the Fort &amp;c

   <P>Newport, October 23</P>
   <P>Last Monday [October 16] the Swan, Capt. Ayscough sailed for Boston, with 2 transport ships,
      several wood vessels, &amp;c. The Swan, it is said, is to proceed from Boston to England. The
      above vessels carried round the live-stock that was bought of the Brentons, that which was
      extorted from Bristol, the Rams taken from Dutch Island, &amp;c. which 'tis thought is all the
      supply of that kind the ministerial forces will ever receive from this quarter, as the
      sea-coasts of this colony are now pretty well guarded.</P>
   <P>By a letter from a gentleman at Falmouth, Massachusetts-Bay, to his friend in this town, dated
      Oct. 9, we learn, that 14 sail of transport ships were then in Penobscot Bay, in quest of wood
      and other necessaries; that Col. [James] Cargill with a body of men had gone in search of
      them, and 'twas hoped he would prevent their getting any supplies. - Perhaps it was this fleet
      returned to Boston, last week, which occasioned the report of a number of ships and troops

      in her, three of whom appeared like Gentlemen, and said they had been a Gunning, but their
      Ammunition being out, they would be glad of a Passage to New-York; Capt: Bates took them on
      board, but soon after the Wind came a Head, he was obliged to put about and take Shelter in
      Cranberry Inlet, where the next Morning his Company was taken from him by Capt. Loverman and a
      Party of his Men from <name>Egg Harbour</name>, who informed Mr. Bates he had taken all the Rest of the
      Crew, and that the Ship they belonged to was a Transport, and that he understood the Captain's
      Name was Thompson 1</P>

   <P>Pennsylvania Packet, MONDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1775 </P>
   <P>Philadelphia, October 23.</P>
   <P>Last Monday morning [October 16] before day, a transport ship, Captain Hastings, was stranded
      on Brigantine Beach, on the coast of New-Jersey. She had on board Capt. <name>Duncan Campbel</name>, Lieut.
      Sims, two Serjeants, and twenty-one Privates, bound from Boston, as they say, for New-York, as
      a recruiting party. The Captain and Lieutenant got off the Beach on Tuesday in a small boat,
      and are supposed to have gone towards Amboy, but 'tis expected they will be taken. Captain
      Hastings, with three of the soldiers, were brought here last Saturday under a guard. The rest
      of the soldiers will be secured. Before they quitted the vessel they threw overboard several
      pieces of cannon belonging to the vessel, 60 muskets and two and an~half barrels of powder.
      The vessel left Boston the 5th of October, in company with a 20 gun ship and one transport
      with some troops bound for Halifax. No other ships of war or troops had sailed. General Gage
      was to sail in a day or two in a merchant ship of 16 guns. The 48th and 59th regiments being
      greatly reduced, the privates are incorporated into other regiments and their officers going
      home. The object of Col. Arnold's expedition was not known at Boston, but supposed to be
      destined against Halifax. </P>

   <P>1. Baltimore Committee, LC.</P>
   <P>2. See Journal of <name>H.M. Sloop Kingsfisher</name>, September 29, 1775; also Barney, ed., Life of Joshua
      Barney, 27-28, which reads: </P>
   <P>When at last he landed, and saw and heard on every hand the din of preparation, and listened
      to the groups of old and young as they recounted at corners and public places the story of his
      country's wrongs, and the long catalogue of British tyranny and injustice, his heart grew big,
      his whole frame dilated - he felt himself already a Commodore! - and glowing with the pride of
      this anticipated promotion, he suddenly, and unannounced, presented himself in the
      counting-house of the plain, plodding, sour old merchant, who owned 'the good ship Sidney,' -
      The old gentleman raised his eyes from the leger (the mysterious pages of which he was
      intently studying,) and fixed them with an inquisitive stare upon the young intruder. - 'Who
      are you, sir?' at length escaped from him, in a tone of surly impatience. - 'I am Joshua
      Barney, master of your ship, just arrived!' - 'Master of my ship, are you, sir? and how dare
      you, sir, an apprentice boy, presume to take command of a ship of mine?' - The 'apprentice
      boy' turned upon him a look of calm disdain, and throwing upon the desk before him the ship's
      papers and other documents of the voyage which he had brought in his hand - 'Read these!' said
      he, and without further reply walked to the window, where he amused himself in looking at the
      various individuals that passed to and fro. - The merchant in the meantime took up the bundle
      of papers, pulled down his spectacles from the top of his head, and was soon profoundly
      interested in the perusal. - The operation was slow - time wore away, and Barney's patience
      began to wear with it: - he had counted every brick in the opposite house, and read every
      sign, backwards and forwards, anagrammatizing the names, as far as he could see them up and
      down street - he coughed walked to the fire - trod upon the toes of the great watch-dog that
      lay stretched before it, and knocked down the poker. - Everything has its end - the last paper
      was at length read, and carefully refolded: the old gentleman lifted his spectacles once more
      above his forehead, and rising from his seat with an agility that little belonged to his
      ordinary motions, he advanced to the young seaman, seized his hand, and giving it a hearty
      shake with both his own, exclaimed, 'Captain Barney, you are welcome home, sir! I am glad to
      see you! I congratulate you heartily upon your safe return! your conduct meets my cordial
      approbation, sir, and I am proud to find that I have so deserving a young man in my employ. -
      Take a seat, sir; we shall see what's to be done immediately!' - The compellation with which
      the venerable merchant commenced this flattering address, was more soothing than all the rest
      of the compliment: - to be called 'captain,' by one who had the legitimate right to bestow
      such titles, was indeed an honor to be prized; it wiped away all remembrance of his insulting
      reception, and when the business of the interview was finished, he made his retiring bow in
      the firm persuasion that <name>John Smith</name> was one of the first merchants in the world!</P>
   <P>Thus ended this truly eventful voyage - the ship had been absent nearly nine months, during
      the last eight - of which Barney had been her commander, though at the moment of his arrival
      but sixteen years and three months old. He had already gone through scenes, and triumphed over
      difficulties, such as occur to few seamen in the course of a long life spent in navigation. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>As I have not had an opportunity of corresponding with Admiral Graves since the 29h of June I
      think it necessary to desire you will be pleased to acquaint their Lordships with some steps I
      have taken at the earnest desire of the Right Honble Lord <name>William Campbell</name> Governor of this
      Province on the 7h of September <name>Lieut Fergusson</name> arrived here with His Majesty's armed Ship
      Cherokee; and notwithstanding the particular service she was intended for it was thought
      necessary I should detain her in this port and the Governor being of opinion that her small
      Complement of Men was not sufficient for the Service that might be required of her; I have
      ordered Lieutenant Fergusson to procure for the Service 20 able bodied Men, and to bear them
      on the Books of the Ship he commands as Supernumeraries for Victuals and Wages. I have also
      procured Pilots for both Ships as well for their Safety as to assist any of His Majesty's
      Ships in entering this port the people of <name>Charles Town</name> having strictly ordered their Pilots
      not to go out of the Harbour. </P>
   <P>On the 24h September I seized and have detained a very fine Schooner that had on board a
      hun[dred] Cannon Shot I understanding she chiefly belongs to an Officer in the Rebel Army and
      as they have actually armed Schooners in this Port it is said with an intention to attack His
      Majesty's Ships have more readily detained the above mentioned Schooner as it was by the
      Governors desire who was then on board for safety thinking her exceedingly fit for that
      purpose. </P>
   <P>I shall not trouble their Lordships with the state of His Majesty's Subjects in this Province
      as his Excellency will give the Secretary of State a more particular Account than I am capable
      of. And am &amp;c </P>

      upwards of one hundred barrels of Powder (the greater part of what was there) was stolen, and
      carried off, either to Philadelphia, or South Carolina, as he supposes. </P>
   <P>I have likewise transmitted herewith, for the further information of Government, Copy of

      at the French Ports and then taking on board a French nominal Master who (in case of
      Examination at Sea) is to produce a fictitious <name>Bill of Sale</name> for the Vessel and call her his
      Property; In consequence of this intelligence I immediately order'd <name>Captn Gordon</name> of the Argo
      to proceed to the Island of Guadaloupe, and deliver'd a Letter from me (Copy of which I have
      likewise in closed) To the Count De Nosier, His Most <name>Christian Majesty</name>'s Govr General of all

   <Title>INHABITANTS OF NORTH YARMOUTH TO <name>GEORGE WASHINGTON</name> 1</Title>
   <P>May it please your Excellency</P>
   <P>We the Inhabitants of North Yarmouth and New Glocester in the County of Cumberland beg Leave
      to acquaint your Excellency that We in these and the neighbouring Towns are greatly alarmed
      and distressed by the Desolation of a great Part of the Town of Falmouth which was on
      Wednesday last [October 18] cannonaded and set on Fire by some of his Majestys Ships of War,
      the Particulars of which we suppose your Excellency has already received some other Way. We
      have been informed their Design was next to assault and destroy North Yarmouth. But that which
      gives us the most painful Apprehensions is, a Jealousy that their Design is to take Possession
      of Falmouth Neck and fortify an Eminence there from which we judge it woud be most difficult
      if not impracticable to dislodge them. In this Case they woud enjoy a most commodius Harbour
      for their Ships &amp; be able to annoy and distress the defenceless Country around them at
      pleasure. We woud further inform your Excellency that we are weak and unprovided with
      Artillery and military Stores in this Part of the Country and shoud they erect a Fortress and
      garrison it with Troops as we have supposed, we judge that unless we are assisted by some of
      your Army or other Ways we must be obliged to fly with our Families or submit to their
      superiour Power. And as to the Importance of this Part of the Colony to the others we refer
      your Excellency to others who are acquainted therewith and can fully inform you. Certain it is
      that from this Part of the Country may be carried Plenty of Fuel Timber &amp;c. and large
      Stocks of all Kinds of Cattle which woud be most serviceable to our Enemies if they shoud once
      get Possession of this Part of the Colony, and thus they might be greatly assisted in carrying
      on Hostilities against other Places. In these distressing Circumstances, we woud commend
      Ourselves to your Excellencys Attention and Compassion, referring the Matter to your Wisdom
      whether you will not judge it expedient to take Possession of the said Eminence in Falmouth
      and fortify and garrison it with some of the Forces under your Command, which woud at the same
      Time prevent such another terrible Ruin as has befallen great Part of that Town and also guard
      the other Parts of this Part of the Colony from Ravages and Devastations. But if your
      Excellency shoud not judge this to be expedient yet we woud pray your Excellency to afford us
      such Assistance of Men &amp; military Stores as your Excellency shall judge proper; that we
      may not be exposed every Hour to be plunderd burnt and destroyed, or be forced naked and
      helpless to leave our Settlements and Habitations and fly for shelter to some other Parts of
      the Country. </P>
   <P>Thus have we briefly and imperfectly ventur'd to lay before your Excellency our distressed
      Scituation and the Anxiety of Mind we are in, not doubting but your Excellency will judge our
      Case worthy your Attention and that your Benevolences to the distressed tho they may be
      utterly unknown to you will influence you to do your Endeavours to afford us that Assistance
      which you shall think we stand in Need of. For further Information we beg Leave to refer your
      Excellency to Dr <name>Edward Russell</name> the Bearer hereof a Gentleman that resides in North Yarmouth
      and is capable of giving your Excellency any further Intelligence you shall need. -</P>

      answer yours &amp; my expectation, I wish with all my soul that these , two vessells were
      dispatchd chiefly for the publick Service, &amp; allso that I may have the pleasure of seeing
      my friends Mr Lynch &amp; Col. Harrison, I want much to be introduced to Doctor Franklin, for

   <P>Col. [John] Glover showed me a Letter of yours which has mortified him much, I realy &amp;
      sincerely believe he has the cause much at heart, &amp; that he has don his best, (in the
      fitting out these four last vessells), for the publick Service you Cannot Conceive the
      difficulty the trouble &amp; the delay there is in procureing the thousand things necessary
      for one of these vessels, I dare say one of them might be fitted in Philadelphia or New york
      in three days, because you would know where to apply for the different articles but here you
      must Search an over Salem Marblehead Danvers &amp; Beverly for every Little thing that is
      wanting I must add to these, the Jobbing of the Carpenters, who are to be sure the Idlest
      Scoundrels in nature, If I coud have procured others, I shoud have dismissd the whole Gang of
      them last Friday, &amp; such religious rascalls are they, that we Goud not prevail on them to
      work on the Sabbath I have stuck very close to them since, &amp; what by Scolding &amp; Crying
      Shame for their torylike disposition in retarding the work, I think they mend something -</P>
   <P>there is one reason, &amp; I think a Substantial one, why a person born in the same town or
      neighbourhood shoud not be employed on publick affairs of this nature in that town or
      neighbourhood, it is that the Spirit of equality which reigns thro' this Country, will make
      him affraid of exerting that authority Necessary [for] the expediteing his business, he must
      shake eve[ry] Man by the hand, &amp; desire, beg, &amp; pray, do brother, do my freind, do
      such a thing, whereas a few hearty damns from a person who did not Care a damn for them woud
      have a much better effect, this I know by experience, for your future government indeed I coud
      give other reasons, but I think this sufficient-</P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>My Conjecture of the Destination of the late Squadron from Boston in my last has been
      unhappily verified by an Outrage exceeding in Barbarity &amp; Cruelty every hostile Act
      practised among civilized Nations. I have inclosed the Account given me by Mr [Pearson] Jones
      a Gentleman of the Town of Falmouth of the Destruction of that increasing &amp; flourishing
      Village. He is a very great Sufferer &amp; informs me that the Time allowed for the Removal of
      Effects was so small that valuable Property of all kinds &amp; to a great Amount has been
      destroyed. The Orders shewn by the Captain for this horrid Procedure by which it appears the
      same Desolation is meditated upon all the Towns on the Coast made it my Duty to communicate it
      as quickly &amp; extensively as possible. - As Portsmouth was the next Place to which he
      proposed to go, General [John] Sulivan was permitted to go up &amp; give them his Assistance
      &amp; Advice to ward off the Blow. I flatter myself the like Event will not happen there, as
      they have a Fortification of some Strength &amp; a Vessel has arrived at a Place called
      Sheepscot with 1500 lb of Powder.</P>

      weigh'd &amp; came up and anchored within Gun Shott and immediately <name>Capt Mowatt</name> sent a Letter
      on Shore to the Town, giving them two Hours to move their Families out, as he had Orders to
      Fire the Town; The Town immediately choose a Committee' of three Gentlemen and sent them on
      Board, to know the reason of that Town's being sett on Fire, he returned for Answer that his
      orders were to set fire on all the Sea Port Towns between Boston and Halifax and that he
      Expected New York was then Burnt to ashes; 2 he further sayed that when he received orders
      from the Admiral he desired that he might shew some favor to the Town of Falmouth, which the
      admiral Granted (I suppose as <name>Capt Mowatt</name> was under particular obligations to some Gentn in
      Falmouth, for Civilities shewn him when in Captivity amongst them) which favor was to spare
      the Town till 9 oclock Wednesday Morning, in case we would send off Eight Small Arms, which
      the Town immediately did. Wednesday Morning being the 18th, the Committee went on Board Capt
      Mowatt again in order to save the Town, he said he would save the Town, till he heard from the
      Admiral, in case we would send off four Carriage Guns, deliver up all our Small Arms,
      ammunition &amp;c and send Four Gentlemen of the Town as Hostages, which the Town would not
      do, at half past Nine in the Morning he began to fire from the four Armed Vessels, and in five
      Minutes set fire to Several Houses; - he continued firing till after dark the same day, which
      consumed the largest part of the Town. - he farther informed the Committee, that he should

   <P>Sir:</P>
   <P>Prospect-Hill, October 24, 1775.</P>
   <P>By an express that arrived from Falmouth last night, we learn the greatest part of the Town is
      in ashes. The enemy fired above three thousand shot into it, and a large number of carcasses
      and bombs, which sat the Town on fire. The enemy landed once or twice, to set fire to the
      stores; they lost eight or ten men in the attempt, and had one taken prisoner. The inhabitants
      got out a very considerable part of their furniture; no person killed or wounded during the
      whole time of their firing. The enemy produced orders from Admiral Graves, to burn all the
      Towns from Boston to Halifax. Captain Mowat informed the Committee at Falmouth, that there had
      arrived orders from England, about ten days since, to burn all the sea-port Towns upon the
      Continent, that would not 1ay down and deliver up their arms, and give hostages for their
      future good behaviour. He also acquainted them, that he expected the City of New York was in
      ashes. By these accounts we may learn what we have to expect. I think Newport should be
      fortified in the best manner it can be. Doubtless the enemy will make an attempt to get the
      stock off the island. Provisions should be made to def eat them. Death and desolation seem to
      mark their footsteps. Fight or be slaves! is the American motto. The first is by far the most
      eligible. In haste, I am, &amp;c. </P>

   <P>A small vessel was the other day cast away on the Jersey shore (she was one of the transports
      which had some time ago brought over troops to Boston), on board of which were a captain, with
      his subordinate officers and marines, amounting to 23 in all, and also a <name>Duncan Campbell</name>, who
      was going to recruit men at New York for General Gage, he having some time before undertaken
      the same business in the same place, and actually carried off 60 men. The marines and their
      officers were all taken immediately, except their captain and the recruiting gentlemen; these
      pushed off in a little boat, and coasted it to Long Island, where they got on board a sloop
      which was to have sailed in an hour, when the party sent after them came upon them. They were
      brought to this city this morning, the marines having been here some time. </P>

   <P>Philadelphia, October 24 [1775].</P>
   <P>The fifteenth instant, at three o'clock in the morning, the transport ship Rachel and Francis,
      1 Capt. Hastings, was stranded upon Brigantine beach, on the coast of New-Jersey. She had on
      board Capt. <name>Duncan Campbell</name>, Lieut. [<name>James Smith</name>] Sims, two serjeants and twenty-one privates,
      belonging to his Majesty's ROYAL HIGHLAND REGIMENT OF EMIGRANTS, bound from Boston (they say)
      to New-York, as a recruiting party. The Capt. and Lieut. got off the beach the next day, in a
      small boat, and went towards New-York, in order to get on board the Asia man of war, which
      they would have effected, if they had not been prevented by the zeal and activity of Lieut.
      Loveland of Egg-Harbour; who, after a tedious pursuit of one day and two nights, t0ok them on
      board a boat at Cranberry inlet, about thirty-five miles from New-York, in which he was
      assisted by <name>Lieut Cook</name> with six men, from an adjacent county, his own party being wore out
      with fatigue. They did not seem greatly alarmed when first taken, but Sims said he would pay
      handsomely to be carried to New-York. As some of the privates are known to have been formerly
      in this city, one of them a servant, and another a soldier, it is supposed they were selected
      as fit persons to inveigle servants and others into the ministerial service. Captain Hastings,
      and three of the soldiers, were conducted here last Saturday [October 21] evening under a
      guard. The rest of the soldiers, and the Captain and Lieutenant were brought here this day.
      Before they quitted the vessel, they threw overboard several pieces of cannon belonging to it,
      sixty muskets, and two barrels and a half of powder. The vessel left Boston the fifth of
      October, in company with a twenty gun ship, and one transport with some troops bound for
      Halifax. No other ships of war or troops had sailed. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>October 25, 1775. We have here a man of war's snow and an armed brig belonging to the navy,
      under the command of a Lieutenant, and three or four armed vessels with about three hundred
      seamen on board, taken up by General Carleton, and we hear there is another man of war on her
      passage in the river. There are several passengers going for England in the ships that are now
      sailing from here. Some of them will give very unfavourable accounts of our situation; but you
      need not give much credit to what they say, for their tale will be suggested by their fears.
      [Thomas] Walker has been taken up, by order of General Carleton, for corresponding with the
      Rebels, and spiriting up the Canadians to take up arms against Government. He is in irons on
      board the Gaspee, armed vessel, together with the New-England Colonel [Ethan] Allen, Major
      [Moses] Hezen, and Captain Turner. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Mr Plumer returned this Afternoon with 500 Flints - for which I will pay - Also a Resolve of
      the General Assembly, for Capt W Johnson of the Schooner Britania, to deliver me four half
      Barrells of Powder for the Use of the [Truck] House at Penobscot. But Alas! p a Packett Mr
      Cross will deliver You you'll see the Resolve must be in Vain -</P>
   <P>The Supply of this Or at least 2 or 3 half Barrells appears to me so absolutely necessary to
      support our miraculous Union with the Indians, that I should have dispatched Plumer back
      tomorrow on the same Errand - But finding Mr Cross intends being with you as soon, I have
      desired him to Make immediate Application for this Powder - And If possible to be procured to
      forward here by Saturday Morning - I will reserve in my Hands the fifty pounds You mentioned
      in the Resolve to be the Price, &amp; send down on Receipt of the Powder - The Vessell will be
      ready to go to Sea by Saturday 11 oClock - Should the Province have no Powder - I think
      General Washington would spare it on having the Case represented - For how would it appear to
      our new Allies, When We cannot furnish them with a little Powder absolutely essential to their
      Subsistance and Defence? - Youll favor me with an Answer immediately whether I may rely on
      this Essential Article or no - As the Vessell may b[e] detained on Uncertainty.-I am
      compleating the Invoices made out by Mr Prebble, which will hand You As soon as finished - I
      refer you to Mr Cross for my Sentiments of that as well as the Agent Who is to deal with the
      Indians -</P>
   <P>Mr Craft delivered me your Favors of 23 Currant - General Sullivan had sent an Express to
      Johnson for his Powder which suppose is on the Road - I therefore had only to let him Mr Craft
      know this - I wish Johnson had enough to supply all Our Wants - We have daily Applications for
      Powder - some in real Distress - particularly Beverly - To Portsmouth in their present Danger
      We have spared, tho' almost guilty of Sacriledge to Ourselves -</P>
   <P>This Town is doing every Thing in their Power to serve themselves - filling up the Channell
      building a floating Battey - Fire Rafts - Entrenchments &amp;c for which I refer to Mr Cross </P>

   <P>About 10 Days ago two floating Batteries were ordered down Cambridge River to fire into the
      Enemy's Camp on Boston Common &amp; alarm the Troops there. 2 It had the expected Effect, but
      was attended with an unfortunate Circumstance. A 9 Pounder the Sixth Time it was discharg'd
      burst, &amp; very badly wounded 7 of the Men. It reduc'd the Batterie to a perfect Wreck. She
      was however brought off with her Remaining Guns &amp;c The Enemy never return'd the Fire. One
      of our Men died of his Wounds next Morning &amp; one since.</P>
   <P>The Enemy have been very quiet in their movements for some Time. We have 16 or 20 flat bottom
      Boats which carry 80 men each finish'd &amp; the Carpenters are at Work on others. What they
      are intended for is not yet known. The Conjecture is that they are design'd for a Descent on
      Boston. -</P>
   <P>We had an Express yesterday from Falmouth Casco Bay who brings News that a Number of the
      Enemy's Ships were in that Harbour, the Capt of which after informing the Inhabts that they
      must deliver Up all their Arms &amp; give Hostages for their peaceable Behaviour, &amp;
      allowing them 24 Hours to comply or he should fire the Town. At the Expiration of the Time
      set, finding they would not comply with the Demand, began a most inf emal Cannonade &amp;
      Bombardment on the Town which destroy'd two thirds of it. After the Ships had burnt 2 or 300
      Houses &amp; drove 2000 People into the Woods they fell down - &amp; it was Suppos'd were
      going to Portsmouth. As they had inform'd the People of Falmouth that they were to visit that
      place next &amp; make the same Requisition, a Non Complyance with which would be attended with
      a Bombardment And that every Seaport Town on the Continent was to be visited for the like kind
      Purpose. These being the Orders from our most gracious King. Surely it is become Time that we
      had a French Fleet to protect our Coasts - On Land we can defend Ourselves. </P>

   <P>I received a Card from our Friend Doctr [Benjamin] Franklin, assuring me a friendly Visit
      before he returns to Philadelphia - If he can spare Time to take a View of the Harbor I hope
      to convince him of the Practicability of stoping up the Narrows, and forcing our Enemies to
      ask our Leave to return home. If you can procure, &amp; send me a Model, or at least a perfect
      Draft of the Machine you mention for obstructing the Passage of Vessels up the River Delaware,
      with explicit Directions how to sink &amp; secure them from being weighed or destroyed by the
      Enemies Ships, it would greatly facilitate the same valuable Purposes here, not only in the
      Narrows, but also in the Lighthouse Channel, which in the narrowest Part, is not much if
      anything above half a Mile wide: - Could the Depth of Water be reduced there, so as to prevent
      Line of battle Ships from entering this Harbor, we might, for the future, bid Defiance to our
      Enemies. But, you shall hear more from me, after I have conversed fully with <name>Doctr Franklin</name>
      upon the Subject, which is, to me, of much more Importance, than I had any Conception of 'till
      I read what you have wrote upon it; and especially, since the cannonading our maritime Towns,

   <P>Providence, October 25th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Capt. Whipple returned here from his voyage to Bermuda, on Friday last [October 20]. He had
      received authentic intelligence of the arrival of the packet at New York before the first time
      limited for his cruise was expired, and immediately sailed for Bermuda. He had light
      flattering winds for several days, and when near the island met with a violent gale, which
      drove him three or four degrees to the southward, which occasioned his having a long passage.
      He put in at the west end of the island where the inhabitants, taking him to be an armed
      vessel belonging to the King, were thrown into the utmost confusion, and the women and
      children fled into the country. But upon showing them his commission and instructions, were
      satisfied and treated him with great cordiality and friendship. They informed him that upon
      the powder being removed, the Governor had given General Gage an account of the part they had
      taken in the transaction, who had dispatched a sloop-of-war and a transport of 600 tone, to
      take all the provisions sent to the island. They then lay at Georgetown, and treated the
      islanders as rebels. Capt. Whipple had five of the King's Council on board his sloop, who all
      assured him that the inhabitants were friends to the American cause, and heartily disposed to
      serve it. As the assistance they gave in the removal of the powder hath made them obnoxious to
      the enemy, and reduced them to a disagreeable situation, I think they ought to be treated with
      every mark of friendship. I submit to your Excellency the propriety of your representing their
      case to the Continental Congress, and recommending them to favour. - We are fitting out Capt.
      Whipple for a cruise to the eastward with all possible expedition, which I hope will prove
      more fortunate than his last. I am, with acknowledgement for the polite treatment received
      from you at Cambridge, and with great respect, Sir, [&amp;c.] </P>

   <Title>A LETTER FROM MARTINIQUE 1</Title>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Martinico, October 25.</P>
   <P>A few days ago an English frigate cast anchor in the harbour of Fort-Royal, under the cannon
      of the fort, and sent some armed men in her boats to seize a New-England vessel which lay in
      that harbour, whose crew they made prisoners, then plundered the vessel, and afterwards left
      her to the mercy of the waves. - The Count de Nozieres being then at Guadaloupe, the Sieur de
      Sablonet, commandant in his absence at Fort Royal, failed not to take upon him to punish this
      violation of the law of nations by firing on the English frigate, which, after this
      expedition, sailed for St. Pierre, where there were then a dozen ships belonging to
      New-England. The frigate anchored, without ceremony, also in that port, and dispatched her
      boats to visit the ships which she suspected to be laden with warlike ammunition; but as they
      met with resistance from the first they attempted to board, the inhabitants of St. Pierre
      defended the English Americans, and having armed themselves, took the boats, with their crews,
      and the men were conveyed ashore, notwithstanding all their resistance; some of them were
      wounded on this occasion. </P>
   <P>The <name>Count de Choiseul-Meuze</name>, second in command at Martinico, and then chief in the absence of
      the general, immediately went to the storehouse where the English were detained, and after
      sharply upbraiding them for so manifest an infraction of the law of nations, he sent a
      detachment on board the English frigate, and caused it to be signified to the commander, that
      he would not release his men till such time as he had repaired the injury which had been done;
      this was accompanied with an express order to put to sea immediately after; and the more
      efficaciously to decide the matter, he instantly set about preparing the battery of St.
      Martha, and threatening to sink the English frigate, if she deferred giving the satisfaction
      which was demanded. The firmness of our commandant had its effects on the captain, who
      speedily performed what was desired, and then weighed anchor, after having received his boats
      and his men. 2 </P>

      equipped without Loss of Time in sending backwards &amp; forwards here for Ammunition the
      General would not object to his going out on a Cruize with her for a Month or 6 Weeks - but if
      it cannot be done in a few Days the Season is too far advanced for this Purpose-We suppose

   <P>Camp at Cambridge, October 26, 1775.</P>
   <P>We have had no Event of any Consequence in our Camp for some Time, our whole Attention being
      taken up with Preparations for the Winter, and forming the new Army, in which many
      Difficulties occur. The Enemy expect considerable Reinforcements this Winter and from all
      Accounts are garrisoning Gibraltar and other Places with foreign Troops, in order to bring the
      former garrisons to America. The Ministry have begun the Destruction of our Sea Port Towns, by
      burning a flourishing Town of about 300 Houses to the Eastward called Falmouth. This they
      Effected with every Circumstance of Cruelty and Barbarity, which Revenge and Malice could
      suggest. We expect every Moment to hear other Places have been attempted and have been better
      prepared for their Reception. </P>
   <P>The more I reflect upon the Importance of your Expedition, the greater is my Concern, least it
      should sink under insuperable Difficulties. I look upon the Interests and Salvation of our
      bleeding Country in a great Degree to depend upon your Success. I know you feel it's
      Importance as connected not only with your own Honour and Happiness; but the publick Wellfare,
      so that you can want no Incitements to press on, if it be possible. My anxiety suggests some
      Doubts, which your better Acquaintance with the Country will enable you to remove. Would it
      not have been practicable to pass <name>St John</name>'s, leaving Force enough for a Blockade; or if you
      could not spare the Men, passing it wholly, possessing yourselves of Montreal, and the
      surrounding Country? Would not <name>St. John</name>'s have fallen of Course or what would have been the
      probable Conse~ quences? Believe me, dear General, I do not mean to imply the smallest Doubt
      of the Propriety of your Operations, or of those of Mr. Montgomery, for whom I have a great
      Respect. - I too well know the absurdity of judging upon a military Operation, when you are
      without the Knowledge of it's concomitant Circumstances. I only mean it as a matter of
      Curiosity, and to suggest to you my imperfect Idea on the subject. I am with the utmost truth
      and Regard, etc. </P>

   <P>Your favor, in Committee of the 12th Instant, is now before us: In answer to which we say,
      That General Washington had laid the affair of the Flour ship before the Congress, some days
      before your favor came to hand; but nothing has been concluded. We urged that the ship and her
      cargo belonged to the Colony, as she was taken by our men in Provincial pay; and not be
      Continental forces: that we had suffered and were still suffering many losses by the taking of
      our ships inward and outward bound - And that before the taking of this Flour ship. As soon as
      this matter is settled shall inform you. </P>
   <P>We are greatly rejoiced to hear that the Batteries are in such Readyness, as we have expected
      to hear that Portsmouth was cannonaded. Capt. <name>George Hastines</name> (who built a ship at Kennebeck
      last year and loaded with masts at Portsmouth) is now here, in a Transport from Boston, bound
      to New York, with Capts. Duncan, Chamble &amp; Lieut. Simes, and a number of men, who were
      imployed to Inlist Scotchmen in the Back parts of New York to reinforce the ministerial Army.
      They are aJl close Prisoners, except Capt. Hastins. A quantity of goods &amp;c. is saved out
      of the Ship. </P>
   <P>I saw Capt. Hastings yesterday, and as I was acquainted with him, he ventured to inform me
      that when he sailed from Boston, 4th Instant, Capt. Mowatt (Scotchman) with three armed
      Transports, were almost Ready to go round to Portsmouth, for the purpose of burning the Town;
      therefore, for God's sake, be you ready. </P>
   <P>You mention Powder; there is a secret Committee for Procuring that article, of which Mr.
      Langdon is one; every Precausion is taking for ample supplies, but as the whole Continent is
      to be supplied, as well as the two armies, it makes it uncertain when can send you any. We beg
      leave here to suggest that the greatest attention should be paid to the use of powder; that no
      Cannon be fired unless Drove to the last extremity ... </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Williamsburg [October 26] The affair at Hampton is at once a proof of the natural bravery of
      our countrymen, of the excellence of their 'aim in firing, and of the insignificancy of
      tenders. No troops could shew more intrepedity than the raw, new raised men, under the command
      of captain [George] Nicholas, of the second regiment, and captain [George] Lyne, of the minute
      men, together with some of the country militia. These brave young officers, at the head of
      their men, without the least cover or breast-work, on the open shore, stood a discharge of 4
      pounders, and other cannon, froin a large schooner commanded by captain Squire himself, and
      from a sloop and two tenders, which played on them with all their guns, swivels, and muskets.
      They stood cooly till the vessels were near enough for them to do execution, when they began a
      brisk and well directed fire, which forced the little squadron to retire. In the night the
      tenders forced their way through the vessels, which were sunk in the mouth of the river, and
      came close up to the very town, on which they fired till they were again repulsed with the
      loss of 9 men killed on board the schooner, and many wounded, 2 killed on board a tender which
      was boarded and taken, and from which lieutenant Write [Wright], of the Otter, made his escape
      wounded, by swimming to the schooner on the opposite shore. Colonel Woodford, who had just
      entered the town as the fire began, with a reinforcement of 50 fine riflemen under the command
      of captain [Abraham] Bluford, an experienced and brave rifleman, compleated the victory, and
      we have no doubt, could they have arrived an hour sooner, so as to have posted their men
      properly, that the schooner and tenders would have been taken. </P>

   <P>The number of men you propose to have raised for our present defence we have considered of and

   <P>I received your favor to me of the 25th &amp; Communicated that part of it which regarded Col.
      [John] Glover unto him - when I last wrote to you, I gave the true reasons, for the delay
      attending the fitting out of these two vessells</P>
   <P>I observe you had given orders to young Glover for all the things write to you for, &amp; he
      is returned without the most Material Article, which is the 300 Swivel shot, he says there was
      none but he says there was plenty of four ounce bulletts, which if had one ounce of Sense he
      must have Known woud answer all the purposes </P>
   <P>this young Gentleman I find has applied to you for a subaltern &amp; twenty Men more than was
      intended for this vessel, I can easily See his reason for it, was to get on board with him, a
      favorite young officer who he apprehended woud not be allowed without an addition of men, I
      see no objection to indulge him with his freind, but I realy see no Necessity for the 20 men
      Nor has there been a provision of Stores Laid in for more than the original number, you must
      allso Consider, that if you indulge one, you must indulge the whole </P>
   <P>I have told him (as his father did not chuse to interfere) that he may have his friend if he
      pleasd, who with 50 more officers included, is all I woud suffer to go on board except I had
      written orders from Headquarters to the Contrary I am very Sure that Number Must be full
      sufficient for all the purposes these Vessells are intended for all above that Number Must be
      an incumberance on board one of these small vessells, &amp; you will find when the Accounts
      Come in, the expence full enough without such an addition </P>
   <P>pray What Keeps Capt. Adams &amp; his Company. His vessell has got all her guns provision
      &amp;c on board &amp; I know there will be many things wanting which we Cannot possibly think

   <P>as Capt. Manly's vessell is all ready, we now only wait the Collecting together his hopefull
      Crew to send him off, I have declared that if there are even 30 onboard to morrow morning
      &amp; the wind proves fair that he shall hoist Sail, but these Swivel shot pray send of[f]

   <P>In Provincial Congress, New-York, October 27th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir-The Committee of Safety, during the recess of the Provincial Congress, held a conference
      with Mr. <name>Bernard Ro</name>'mans, and engaged his services as an engineer in building the
      fortification on Hudson's river. He objected to them, that his pension from the Crown of about
      £50 sterling per year as botanist for one of the Floridas might be taken away, when it was
      known that he had assisted this Country, and therefore prayed-that he might be engaged as an
      engineer in the Continental service. The Committee thereupon promised him the pay of fifty
      dollars per month for the present, and informed him that it was probable his services would be
      wanted. We are not competent to the perfecting this business, and therefore pray that the
      Congress will make some order in the premises. As to the quantum of his pay, if fifty dollars
      is thought too little, the Congress will be pleased to fix upon the sum which they think
      adequate to the duties he is to perform.</P>

   <P>Dear Sir -</P>
   <P>Cambridge 28 Octr 1775</P>
   <P>If tears of blood were to follow my pen, they wou'd but faintly marke the distressing anxiety
      I have suffered for near three Months past - to be betrayed into a situation which equally
      exposed me to the Insults of my Enemies and the Suspicions or Contempt of my Friends, by a
      Scoundrel whose base duplicity, I cou'd neither expose or counteract, excited feelings, which
      often proved too severe a trial for my utmost fortitude - I have been a week in the Country
      &amp;till now have not had resolution enough to write you a line - I have so much to
      communicate, that at present I shall only relieve my Mind of what I cannot contain. - It was
      generally presumed (&amp; I con£ ess with the greatest apparent reason) that . the discovery
      of those letters was owing to my imprudence - imprudence in such a Case I should esteem a
      Crime, &amp; a crime of such a nature as, in myself, I could never pardon the circumstances
      were shortly these - when we came to New York, contrary to our expectations, we found a packet
      boat waiting for Passengers, &amp; in the opinion of every one there was not the least Danger
      in crossing the Sound, we accordingly took passage for New Port, &amp; I never saw more reason
      for destroying your letters till the second day we had been on board the Man of war, than
      there was for throwing them in the River Delaware. Capt Ayscough Received us on board the Ship
      with the greatest politeness &amp; Civility, making a thousand apologies for the rough
      treatment he had given us - said his object was the Sailors, who were in the boat with us,
      &amp; was very sorry he had stopt us in our passage this continued till the next day, when His
      Conduct suddenly wore a quite different appearance - I told <name>Mr White</name>, that <name>Scoundrel Stone</name>, (a
      person who formerly was Clerk to <name>Henry Lloyd</name>, &amp; came passenger with us from New York) had
      given Ayscough some information which had produced this Change in his. Conduct, &amp; it was
      time for me to secure my letters, I had before this secreted them in a part of the Ship where
      I thought them perfectly safe - I immediately loaded them with money of the least Value I had
      about me intending, to Drop them over board in the Event: we (<name>Mr White</name> &amp; myself) were then
      told that we must look upon ourselves as prisoners, &amp; while Mr Stone was caressed in the
      Cabin, we had a Centinel over us - However I had then, not the least doubt of eluding their
      Strictest Scrutiny - my plan I thought was compleat &amp; ensured me success; I had provided a
      couple of blank letters directed to General Washington &amp; Colo [James] Warren, which in
      Case Stone should acknowledge himself the Informer &amp; confront me with his declaration, I
      intended to deliver up with seeming reluctance &amp; pretend I had concealed them through fear
      - just as the boat was preparing to carry our baggage on board Capt: Wallace for examination a
      Gentleman who came passenger with us from New York sent on board for a trunk which we thro'
      mistake had taken for our own, this circumstance looked so favourable that I could not avoid
      seizing, to get the Letters on shore - I opened the trunk with my own key put the letters in
      the folds of the Gentns Linen &amp; with some difficulty locked it again, when the trunk came
      upon deck the Lieutenant mistook it for mine put it into the boat with the rest of our things
      &amp; rowed off immediately on board the other Ship - by such a mere accident as this, did the
      letters fall into their Hands - The next day an Officer told <name>Mr White</name> that he heard Stone
      giving the Capt: information of the Letters, or we shoud never have been searched or suspected
      - General Washington does not yet appear altogether Satisfied with my Conduct - the only
      Satisfaction I have at present arises from the generous Reception I met with from Colo!
      Warren, but my anxiety to know your Sentiments of the part I have taken prevents my attention
      to any thing else - I am sensible of the injustice I do you in harbouring the least diffidence
      of your generosity, but at the same time I know your nice feelings must receive such a shock
      from having your confidential observations, upon such delicate Subjects exposed, that the
      Reflection gives me the keenest of pain - General Washington &amp; the World, may think meanly
      of me, but suffer me to say without the appearance of adulation, - possessed of your
      Confidence &amp; favourable opinion, I can be happy under their united frowns - nothing but a
      line of approbation from you can restore me to myself - let me intreat you, if from no other
      motives but pity, to send me a short letter by the Post, &amp; I will then open myself to you
      with the greatest freedom - enclosed you have a rude plan of a design which I am satisfied may
      be carried into execution with the .greatest ease - I Propose communicating it to the Genl
      through Mr [James] Bowdoin - I am Sir your unhappy but Sincere Friend </P>

   <P>When we removed Part of the Live Stock from Block Island in July last a Number of Cattle were
      left, so poor (owing to the severe Drought) that they were totally unfit for the Knife. The
      plentiful Rains that have since fallen have increased the Feed so much that there are now
      upwards of 300 fit for Market: The Island is situated so far from the Continent that any
      Attempt to remove them will be extremely hazardous; And I can think of no other Method to
      prevent their being taken by the Enemy, than killing and salting them. As we have no Demand
      for salted Provisions in this Colony, I must desire your Excellency to take order that the
      Beef, when barrelled, may be received into the Magazines in Camp, at a reasonable Price; in
      which Case they will be killed and cured forthwith. - You are sensible Sir of the unhappy
      Situation of this Colony with Respect to the Enemy, it being scarcely any Thing more than a
      line of Sea-Coast; and I have no Doubt will give us every Assistance in your Power. </P>

   <P>Wednesday last [October 25] the Viper Sloop of War, Captain Greaves, arrived at Newport from
      New-York. Capt. Barnes's Sloop, one of the four Prizes mentioned under the New-York Head to be
      taken by the Viper,1 has been re-taken by a lucky Stratagem. - A Midshipman and four Hands
      were put on board, with two of Capt. Barnes's Crew, and the Master of another Vessel lately
      taken by the Enemy, was shipped as a Pilot. Their Orders were to carry the Vessel to Boston,
      but if separated from the others, to take her into Newport. They parted the first Night, and
      the Night following made Rhode-Island. The Pilot was carrying her in at East Side, and on the
      Midshipman's expressing his Surprize at not seeing the Light-House, he was informed that the
      Sons of Liberty had burnt it. They soon came to an Anchor at Rowland's Ferry; the Midshipman
      enquired for the Men of War, when the Pilot pointing to the Lights on Shore, told him there
      were the Ships. Early next Morning the Pilot, assisted by Capt. Barnes's Men, nailed up the
      Companion Door, and beckoned a Number of People on board from the Shore, who released the
      Pirates from their Confinement, and conducted them to Head-Quarters on the Island, from whence
      they have been brought to this Town, and safely lodged in Gaol. </P>
   <P>We are informed that a Schooner of 120 Tons, belonging to the Enemy, has been lately taken,
      and carried into Machias. She had been up the Bay of Fundy, and had on board a parcel of

   <P>The following is the substance of the examination of Elijah Cable, of Fairfield, in
      Connecticut, taken yesterday before the Provincial Congress; viz.</P>
   <P>That he left <name>St. John</name>'s on Friday the 13th, that there is about 4000 men at that place;
      General Montgomery is on the South side, and the Canadians on the East side; the bomb battery
      is 66 or 67 rod from the fort, that they had set one barrack on fire in the fort, with the
      great mortar commonly called the old sow. On Saturday the 14th, when he was at the Isle a
      Noix, a very heavy firing began early in the morning, and continued until night, and then
      began the next morning, and continued until 10 o'clock when the firing ceased, what was the
      event of this action he could not tell, the wind being fair he set sail. He met General
      Wooster near Ticonderoga; our people had taken from the Regulars some blanket coats, stockings
      and shoes, four hogsheads of rum, and some wine; that a party of the Regulars went out in a
      floating battery to drive off our Canadians, about 500 in number, who were at work on the East
      battery, but were repulsed three days successively. Saw several Indians when he came away; our
      people lie on the North side, about three quarters of a mile from the fort, and often go up
      and kill the centinels. Provisions plenty, and the men in good spirits. Our army had lately
      received a reinforcement of 600 men from different quarters. General Montgomery has a sloop, a
      schooner, and two row gallies, each has a twelve pounder, and eight or nine swivels, a boom is
      across at Isle a Noix. Our people shot several holes thro' the King's vessel after she was
      hauled up. No snow when he left <name>St. John</name>'s. </P>
   <Title>JOURNAL OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS 1 </Title>
   <P>[Philadelphia] Saturday, October 28, 1775 </P>
   <P>The Comee of Safety of Philada laid before the Congress the examination of sundry of those who
      came in the transport Rebecca and Frances, and desired the advice of Congress, what ought to
      be done with the men taken. </P>
   <P>The Congress taking this under consideration, </P>
   <P>Resolved, That <name>Captn Campbell</name> and lieut. Symes, and the men who came with them in the
      transport Rebecca and Frances, be confined in the such gaols in this Colony, as the Comee of
      Safety of sd Colony think proper, and that said <name>Captn Campbell</name> and lieutenant Symes be allowed
      for their subsistance 1 1/3 dollar each, pr week, and the men one dollar pr week each, to be
      paid out of the continental treasury. </P>

   <Title>&quot;EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM PHILADELPHIA, OcT. 28.&quot; 1 </Title>
   <P>On Monday morning the 16th instant, the transport ship, Capt. Hastings, of London, bound from
      Boston for New York, with seventeen seamen, a Capt. <name>Duncan Campble</name>, a Lieut. Sims, a
      recruiting serjeant, and fifteen or twenty ragamuffin fellows, that had ran from New York and
      listed, who acted as marines on board, ran ashore on Brigantine Beach, near <name>Egg Harbour</name>, where
      she is lost. The seamen and marines were secured soon after their coming on shore, and
      conducted to this city, where the former are set at liberty, but the marines are properly
      secured. Capt. Campble, Lieut. Sims, and one Cameron, (who it appears were to land at New York
      to list what men they could, by large promises of confiscated land, which he never could
      fulfill, get them on board the Asia, and then transport them to Boston) left the ship in a
      small boat, put into a place called Cranbury Inlet, but being pursued, were seized on board a
      sloop in which they had taken their passage for New York. - It is said before they quitted the
      ship they threw overboard several pieces of cannon belonging to the vessel, 60 muskets, and
      two and half barrels of powder. The vessel left Boston the 5th of October, in company with a
      20 gun ship and one transport with some troops bound for Halifax. No other ships of war or
      troops had sailed. </P>

   <P>Dixon &amp; HuNTER's <name>Virginia Gazette</name>, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1775 </P>
   <P>Williamsburg, October 28.</P>
   <P>After Lord Dunmore, with his troops and the navy, had been for several weeks seizing the
      persons and property of his Majesty's peaceable subjects in this colony, on Wednesday night
      last [October 25] a party from an armed tender landed near Hampton, and took away a valuable
      Negro man slave and a sail from the owner; next morning there appeared off the mouth of
      Hampton river a large armed schooner, a sloop, and three tenders, with soldiers on board, and
      a message was received at Hampton, from Captain Squires, on board the schooner, that he would
      that day land and burn the town; on which a company of regulars and a company of minute-men,
      who had been placed there in consequence of former threats, denounced against that place made
      the best disposition to prevent their landing, aided by a body of militia, who were suddenly
      called together on the occasion. The enemy accordingly attempted to land, but were retarded by
      some boats sunk across the channel for that purpose; upon this they fired several small cannon
      at the provincials, without any effect, who, in return, discharged their small arms, so
      effectually, as to make the enemy move off, with the loss of several men, as it is believed;
      but they had, in the mean time, burnt down a house belonging to Mr. Cooper on that river.</P>
   <P>On intelligence of this reaching Williamsburg, about nine at night a company of riflemen were
      despatched to the aid of Hampton, and the Colonel of the 2d regiment sent to take the command
      of the whole, who, with the company, arrived about eight o'clock next morning. The enemy had,
      in the night, cut through the boats sunk, and made a passage for their vessels, which were
      drawn up close to the town, and began to fire upon it soon after the arrival of the party from
      Williamsburg; but as soon as our men were disposed as to give them a few shot, they went off
      so hastily that our people took a small tender with five white men, a woman, and two slaves, 6
      swivels, 7 muskets, some small arms and other things, a sword, pistols, and several papers
      belonging to a Lieutenant Wright, who made his escape by jumping overboard, and swimming away
      with Mr. King's Negro man, who are on shore, and a pursuit, it is hoped, may overtake them.
      There were in the vessel two men mortally wounded, one is since dead, and the other near his
      end; besides which, we are informed, nine men were seen to be thrown overboard from one of the
      vessels. We had not a man wounded. The vessels went over to Norfolk, and we are informed the
      whole force from thence is intended to visit Hampton to-day. If they come, we hope our brave
      troops are prepared for them, as we can with pleasure assure the public that every part of
      them behaved with spirit and bravery, and are wishing for another skirmish. </P>

   <P>No 33. </P>
   <P>Great, indeed, has been His Majesty's forebearance, and patience, with the perverse Americans.
      His Majestys benign good heart, has, my Lord, been tryed, to the very utmost extreme of
      tenderest humanity. The excesses of outragious madness become grievous and intollerable. </P>
   <P>No wonder, my Lord, they have turned the Kings compassion into anger. These wicked people have
      compelled His Majesty to the determination of puting in force such vigorous efforts, as may
      reduce the rebellious to order and obedience. I hope in God the effects of these measures,
      will be speedily most severely felt by them, that they may meet such just punishments as are
      the rewards of such enormous crimes. </P>
   <P>It is very unfortunate your Lordships expectations, are disapointed in the conduct of the
      Southern Provinces. All the Provinces north of East Florida, have entered into and adopted,
      the wicked measures of the Massachusets. </P>
   <P>I trust now, my Lord, better times are not far off, that, the Plans forming may be attended
      with the most propitious success, untill our excellent Constitution be in permanence firmly
      fixed, and His Majesty's Government perfectly established, over all the British Dominions. </P>

      Set an Example to the other Seaports by Setting the Fleet at Defiance upon my arrival I was
      Surprized to find that the Boom So much Talked of was not prepared That the Bridge Intended
      for Crossing from the main to the Island Whereon Stands the Principal Fort (Called Fort
      Washington) had nothing more done than one Pier Sunk That there was not a foot of the Parapet
      over which a man might fire or Even See his Enemy that t.he Embrazures at the Foot were
      Horizontal as Well as the Top of the Parapet &amp; in Short not a moments Defence Could be
      made or anoyance given to the Enemy Either With Cannon or Small Arms - I Immediately Collected
      a Number of Gondalows moored them head &amp; Stern Laid pieces from one to the other &amp;
      Plank across &amp; Soon Compleated the Bridge I then Turned My attention to the Boom &amp; in

      Set those vessels in Flames. I have also a great Number of fire Rafts ready to Let Loose upon

   <P>Your Favor of the 25th Instant came safely to hand. Capt. Whipple's Voyage has been
      unfortunate, but it is not in our Power to Command Success, tho' it is always our duty to
      deserve it; I hope he will be more Successful in his intended Voyage, if it is proposed in
      consequence of the Direction of the Congress, I think it proper you should apprize him, that
      two Schooners have Sail'd from hence to the Mouth of St. Lawrence River, upon the same Service
      Commanded by Capt. Broughton and Captain Sellman; The Signal which they have agreed on to
      distinguish each other and to be known to their Friends is the Ensign up to the Main Topping
      Lift. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Your Favour of the 26 Inst came to Hand this Moment. I am very sorry for the Accident that
      happened, but we hope more Care will be taken in future The Vessel was well recommended, &amp;
      as she is a good Sailor we hope you will soon put yourself in a better We expect a Brig &amp;
      a Schooner taken at Martha's Vineyard will be in Plymouth in a few days, Major [Benjamin]
      Tupper who took them requested they might be fitted out from hence, to which the Advance of
      the Season &amp;c was objected, but the General consented he might take one of them if he
      could man &amp; fit her out at Plymouth immediately - If he should want one of them he is to
      have her, upon those terms, but you may have the other if you can immediately Shift into her
      without loss of Time - but we rather wish you should proceed in the Harrison as she is fitted
      out &amp; sails well - There are a great many Vessels on the Coasts so that you may do your
      Country great Service &amp; acquire much Honour yourself if you proceed immediately - It is
      under the Consideration of Congress to give the Officers &amp; Men one dear third of the whole
      without any Reserve which I mention for your Encouragement - I wish you all possible Success
      &amp; am, Sir, &amp;c. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Capt Coit</name> has informed us of the Accident which hapned to his Vessel thro' the Stupidity &amp;
      Unskilfulness of the Pilot - We wonder we did not hear from you or Martindale by the Return of
      this Messenger. As we are quite at a Loss about the Ammunition to be got from hence &amp; the
      Time of Marchg the Men to Plymouth - However as by all Accounts the Vessel is ready I have
      Ordered the Men to have Notice to march to morrow or as soon as the Weather will permit. </P>
   <P>A Gentleman from Plymouth informs us this Morning that they cannot Spare the Powder from the
      Stock unless it is immediately replaced - you will therefore be particular in your Accounts
      that we may know how to repay it. - They speak of a brass Field piece which they cannot well
      Spare, you will also leave it unless it is indispensably necessary for the Vessels which we
      cannot Suppose -</P>
   <P>You may let <name>Capt Coit</name> Martindale know that it is under Consideration of Congress to allow a
      great[er] Share of Prizes to the Officers and Men - we hope all will exert themselves for the
      Good of our Common Country. Two of our Vessels sail out of Marblehead to day - if the Weather
      permits - two are already gone to the Eastward - I am in haste &amp;c.</P>

   <P>I left Plimouth on tuesday evening [October 24] &amp; arrived here the next evening, I
      presented the Letter to the Committee, who told me that what guns there was in town belonged
      to Capt <name>Simn Potter</name> &amp; that he might dispose of them if he Pleased. - I Waited on Capt
      Potter, but could not agree with him for them I went next morning on Rhode Island to Genl
      Hopkins's Quarters where I found guns Suitable but could not get them without an Order from
      the Lt Governor, I set out Immediately for Providence, &amp; found the Lt Govr was out of town
      but was expected next day by noon, I waited till 4. oClock when he returnd, from the Assembly,
      he Said I must wait till morning for an Ansr as the Committee were to set that evening. - the
      next morning I got an Ordr for 10.4 pounders. but could get no Swivels as they were wanted for
      the Galleys in Providence. I then Proceeded for this Place where I arrived Yesterday
      afternoon, &amp; Tryed to get Capt Potters Guns, again - in the evening he made me an Offer,
      which I thought too high, This morning got my horse &amp; was going to Rd Island for the Guns
      there when I cal'd on <name>Capt Potter</name> &amp; made him another offer, which after some time he
      Accepted, have Just got the Cannon, Swivels, Carriages, Shott &amp;c on Board a Boat to be
      carried to Taunton which is half the Distance. - Shall go forward this evening to Procure
      Carts to carry them to Plymouth, &amp; Shall Wait at Taunton till I see them under way, I
      could have got the Guns off Rhode Island, considerable Cheaper, I believe, but could get no
      Swivels with them which was the Reason that I bot these,</P>
   <P>It has taken much more time to procure these Guns than I expected, but as I have used the
      Utmost dispatch Possible, I think it cannot be displeasing to the General, I expect to have
      the cannon in Plymouth by tuesday night if the [Wind] is Such that they can be got to Taunton
      Tomorrow - I am, [&amp;c.]</P>

      refused payment for the cargo of 2200 barrels of flour on board the ship Charming Peggy, Capt.
      [Thomas] Dowman, from this port to Lisbon, formerly taken by the Mercury man of war, and
      carried into Boston. The General at first refused to deliver up even the ship, but on a second
      application, he informed Capt. Dowman, that he might proceed with the ship to any port he
      thought proper; however the Admiral [<name>Samuel Graves</name>] would not permit his departure, save to
      Great Britain, or the English West India Islands, and that he had cleared out the ship in
      ballast for Barbadoes, and only waited to procure hands to man the ship, which was very
      difficult to do. </P>

   <P>On Wednesday [October 25] arrived here his Majesty's Viper sloop of war, from New-York, having
      taken 2 brigs, loaded with salt, and a large sloop, loaded with rum and sugar, from Antigua;
      all belonging to New-York. - One of the brigs, Capt. Liburn, arrived here a few hours after
      the Viper. The sloop had a Midshipman, and 7 hands put on board; one of whom, belonging to
      Bristol in this colony, was to pilot her into this harbour; instead of which he carried her up
      near Rowland's-ferry, where she was taken possession of by some of the troops stationed on
      this island, and the people made prisoners, - The other brig, above mentioned, arrived here
      yesterday.</P>
   <P>Yesterday sailed for Boston, wind N.W. the Viper sloop of war, with a brig loaded with salt,
      and a Custom-house schooner. </P>

   <P>Dear Sir,</P>
   <P>New york 30th Octor 1775</P>
   <P>I have many matters of importance to communicate to you, respecting our own Safety and the
      Public Security, which time will not now permit to enumerate. Sufice it that the Tories are
      chearfal, and too many of the Whigs make long Faces. Men of rank and Consideration refuse to
      accept of commissions as Field officers of the Militia; so that these commissions have gone a
      beging for Six or Seven weeks. This requires no Comment to one of your disernment. Our
      Congress wrote Some days Since to your's, to replace the Powder you order[ed] from us for
      Continental Service, and that we voluntarily spared it. But we have not been favoured with an
      answer, altho we have not 300 lb at our Command if it would Save the Colony; and the
      inhabitants are very illey Supplied, not a Quarter of a Pound per man in the Hands of half the
      Citizens; and the Country much worse. This .is a deploreable State to be in for men who have
      their all at Stake. &quot;For God's&quot; Sake quicken the replacing of our Powder. The
      serving of Artillery require men of more Talents and greater Soberity than is requisite for
      musketry; the former being more complex than the Latter. For this reason I got our Congress to
      write to yours for an order to enlist matrosses for the Fort on Hudsons River. what detains
      it? are the men for this part of the Service to be raised when the Guns are mounted; and
      thereby expose the Post to fall into the Hands of the Enemy from the unskilfulness of the
      matrosses. You may be assured infantry alone cannot defend Such a Post; unless they have been
      long Trained to the Artillery. General Waster's [<name>David Wooster</name>'s] corps, which you ordered for
      the Fort, is by this at <name>St John</name>'s in Consequence of orders he received from <name>Genl Schuyler</name>,
      before yours to the former to return hither reached him: that there are no Continental Forces
      nearer the Post on Hudsons river, than lake George, except two incompleat Companies in our
      Barracks; one of the first and the other of the Third Regiment. As it will be very difficult
      if not imposible, to procure the Stores Necessary for that Post, on the Sea Coast, I wish the
      Continental Congress, would pass an order without delay to enable us to take Such Stores from
      Ticonderoga, as will be wanted for it; and also to enable this and the other Colonies to take
      from that Fort or Crown Point Such Stores as may be requisite for the defence of the Colonies,
      especially lead of which there is a great abundance. I have urged our Congress to dispatch a
      Sloop we were obliged to buy, for Powder; but as it is difficult to procure Gold &amp; Silver
      or Bills of exchange, it will be necessary to Send provission with her, which in Some of the
      Island will facilitate the geting that article. But the Congress wait your determination on
      the Trade. To prevent excuses for those whose Parsimony is very Criminal, and pretexes for
      false Brethren, I think it would be advancive of the Public Service, were the Congress to pass
      a Resolution to enable us, to Send provission for amunition if we shall Judge it Necessary. .
      For there is not a moment to be lost in procuring this necessary Article. our all depends opon
      it. The Viper's Conduct detained a Sloop we had ready here to dispatch for Powder 15 days; and
      she is Soon to return. I therefore intreat you to get the opinion of Congress on this matter
      without delay, and if it Should be favourable dispatch it by express that we may expedite that
      Vessel before the return of the Viper. The intelligence from <name>St John</name>'s is to the 13th Instant,
      by Captain [John] Quackenboss of my Regt who is returned Sick. He Say that he left it the
      13th, That the next morning a Battery of 2 Twelve, 2 Nine &amp; 2 Six pounders was to be
      opened on the East Side of the River against John's, which was to play on the Schooner &amp;
      Galley of the Enemy. That the Ground on which the Battery is errected is much higher than that
      on which <name>St John</name>'s stand, in so much that the Battery would command the Parade of the Fort.
      That he Heard a very heavy canonade the 14th, which began at Sun rise and continued all the
      day, and commenced the next at sun rise; and ceased all at once about 10 oClock. That the
      Troops were healthier than they had 'been and in good spirits; That they had plenty of
      Provissions and latterly fresh. That one of our Bombs had fired a large House the Principal
      Barrack in the Fort; but was extinguished. This intelligence is confirmed by another Person.
      From all I have been able to Collect, the Fort is compleatly invested, and so near, that the
      beseigers can hear the Garrison Speak to each other. That they are not Strongh enough to make
      any Sallies. So that if we do not Succeed, it must be for want of engirier's, and amunition.
      For if these were well Supplied the place must have Surrender or been destroyed. Time will
      only permit me to add that I am with great Truth [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>The Sailors Wages are set at Five Dollars each, in addition to which I propose that one third
      the Value of all prizes taken be shared between the Officers and Seamen-</P>
   <P>The Enemy have not a Naval force Now on this Coast equall to the foregoing, if the Asia,
      Somerset, &amp; Boyne be put out of the Question - These Three Shipps are ordered home and
      Forty Gunn Shipps and downward are to be employed on the American Station for the future - it
      is evident if they cruize in a Fleet they will not be formidable to Trade, and if single they
      will be liable to be attacked by an equall if not Superior force of the Continental fleet -
      Connecticut has fitted out Two &amp; Rhode Island Two, these joining with the Two from the
      Massachusetts and those which other Colonies &amp; Individuals will fix for the Sea will go
      near, to form a Naval force equall if not Superior to what the Ministry will think of sending
      to America the Next season for they dream as little of Our meeting them, on the Sea as of Our
      invading Canada, and though their Naval power, &amp; resources be ever so great in Brittain,
      they must inevitably be defeated the Next Campaign in America if We get early to Sea, these
      Shipps, and with them surprize, &amp; intercept their Transports, or any considerable part of
      them, this effected, the distance between Us &amp; Europe will put it out of their power to
      recover the blow, untill the season is over-</P>
   <P>What will be the Loss to the Continent if these Vessels should be so unfortunate as to make no
      prizes?-I answer the Three Mo Wages and provisions will Amount to nearest one Third' of the
      Gross Sum or sixty Thousand Dollars, and the ware &amp; Tare will make up Ninety or one half
      which is a large Computation - but if by means of this Force the Coastwise Trade only is
      protected to say Nothing of securing the introduction of Ammunition &amp;c under their
      protection-</P>
   <P>The freight of Flour only to the Army will amount to a great part of the Sum, as every Barrel
      which they consume at present pays at least 12 Dollar Transportation more than if carried by
      Water 40,000 Barrels transported will save Sixty Thousand out of the Ninety Thousand Dollars
      and other Articles will doubtless Amount to as much more - it is a fact that more than 40,000
      Bls. of Flour have been consumed the present Season-</P>
   <P>But the probability of Captures is much, in favor of the adventure The Transports unsuspecting
      danger will sail without Convoy every prize of this kind is of double advantage - it weakens
      &amp; disappoints the Enemy, strengthens &amp; encourages Our Army -</P>
   <P>It is good policy now to set on foot a Naval Force ,under proper Regulations, &amp; the
      reasons for it are -</P>
   <P>At least Ten Thousand Seaman are thrown out of employ in the Northern Colonies - these with
      their Owners, &amp; the various mechanics, dependant on this extensive branch of Business
      cannot possibly long rest easy, in their present destitute, distress'd Situation, their Shipps
      rotting &amp; their Families starving - They will not revolt from the Cause but reprisal being
      justifiable as well by the Laws of Nature as of Nations, they will pursue the only method in
      their power for indemnifying themselves, and Reprisals will be made-</P>
   <P>This will at best be but a kind of Justifiable piracy &amp; subject to No Law or Rule the
      Consequences may be very pernicious-</P>
   <P>The first fortunate Adventurer will set many more on pushing their Fortunes-</P>
   <P>Is it not more prudent, where the Loss can, at most, be so trifling to Turn this Spirit, this
      Temper, this Necessity of the Times down its right &amp; proper Channel, and reduce it while
      in its infancy to Rule &amp; Order before it become thro Want of Regulation, unmanageable. </P>
   <P>This will be, not only preventing, a Licentious roving, or piracy, but will be turning Our
      Enemies Weapons upon him-</P>
   <P>Should private adventurers take up the Matter, every one will soon make his own Laws &amp; in
      a few Years, No Law will govern, the mischief will grow rapidly &amp; Our Own property will
      not be safe,-</P>
   <P>Such Adventures are already desired upon, Witness, several Captures made by the provincials
      without order or direction-</P>
   <P>This calls upon Us to be taken up &amp; regulated at the first setting o[r] it will afterward
      be out of Our power Our Coasts will swarm with roving adventurers, who if they forbear
      plundering of Us or Our immediate Friends, may thro Necessity invade the property of the
      Subjects of those with whom We wish to stand well, &amp; bring Accumulated Mischeif on these
      Colonies-</P>
   <P>Can there be a scheme, or plan, by which, the above proposed, Naval Armament may be equipp'd,
      without burthening these Colonies, or interfering with their other important &amp; Necessary
      Operations? I think there may, &amp; therefore take leave to propose -</P>
   <P>I. That a Committee of persons skill'd in Maratime Affairs be Appointed to fitt for Sea with
      all possible dispatch the foregoing Vessels of Warr that They have power to Commission proper
      persons to command the same and to Constitute such rules, Ordinances; &amp; directions as they
      shall judge best for the well regulating such Naval force, subject to the revision, &amp;
      Alteration, of the General Congress, or such board as they may hereafter appoint for that
      purpose - Also to give the several Commanders from Time to Time such Instructions for their
      Conduct as they shall judge Necessary Subject to the Controll of the Congress -</P>
   <P>II. This Committee shall receive from the Continental Treasury the Sum of <gap/> in Bills
      emitted solely for that purpose &amp; made redeemable as hereafter provided for, and that sd
      Committee receive after the rate of <gap/> p Cent on the Sums by them disbursed, in executing
      said Trust for the Congress-</P>
   <P>III. These Vessels shall cruise, only to protect the Trade of these Colonies from the insults
      of Ministerial Cutters, &amp; Shipps of Warr, &amp; for intercepting, &amp; seizing such
      Vessels as shall be employed to Transport Stores, or shall have Stores on board for the
      Ministerial Forces employed against these Colonies-</P>
   <P>IV. The neat proceeds of all prizes after deducting the Shares of the Captors shall be by the
      Committee Accounted for to the Congress, by them to be applied toward sinking the Bills
      emitted for that purpose - all Convoy Mony, or for freight, shail be applied to the same
      purpose but of these the Officers &amp; Seamen shall have no Share - Whatever Stores, or
      Vessels, which on being found Useless for the present &amp; shall be judged proper for Sale,
      they shall be sold for Gold, or Silver, or those Bills emitted for Naval purposes &amp; the
      Neat [net] Amount of the Sales shall be applied to discharge &amp; sink the Sum first Granted
      for these purposes</P>
   <P>V. The Vessels of Warr already fitted out by any of these Colonies or Individuals or such as
      may hereafter be fitted out &amp; shall join any part of the Fleet belonging to the Continent
      shall during their continuing with such Fleet or any part thereof be under the same Orders
      &amp; Regulations as sd Fleet are, &amp; be subject to the Directions of the cheif Commander
      of the Continental Fleet then present, and all prizes taken, they or any of them present,
      &amp; assisting - shall be divided by the proportion of Gunns &amp; Men in the respective
      Shipps or Vessels present-</P>
   <P>VI. That the first Commissioned Captain be stiled Commodore and be considered as, &amp; have
      the powers of a Commander in Chief, under the Congress, or sd Committee over sd Fleet-</P>
   <P>I have now run over the outlines of a Naval Establishment, the American Exchequer, may have No
      Money to spare, for such an Adventure - That is not the Question - is it Necessary, if so, let
      Us look for Ways, &amp; Means, I would have the Money, struck for the use of the Navy, be kept
      as a distinct affair, &amp; the Bills be sunk, or discharged independant of other Concerns. -
      if there should be any prizes they will help to pay off the Bills, The Sales of the Vessels,
      after the Cruize, if the Congress should not incline to keep it longer, in pay, will go £arr
      in paying off the Bills. Suppose to make out the One half only, it is very probable, that
      selling, even at this discount with the Convoy Money, Freight &amp; prizes, that the whole
      will be discharged - but in case this should fail &amp; the whole at the end of Three Mo be
      sunk, will not the forcing Our Enemy to keep their Naval force collected in a Fleet give such
      a free access to Vessels bringing the Stores We want, be an advantage adequate To this Sum? I
      think it will &amp; more-</P>
   <P>The Bills emitted should be paid off in three annual payments, and suppose to render the
      payment certain without burthening the public it be, by Three annual Lotteries, in which Case,
      whatever the Fleet may bring in, may be applied to the repairing of it, &amp; increasing, if
      Necessary This will take off all popular Objection in point of expences-</P>
   <P>The Continent may be alarmed, at an additional expence, if a Navy be set on foot at
      Continental Charge, but a provision for sinking the Bills, by Lottery, will burthen no one,
      and it can be done with the greatest Certainty, by putting the Lottery, in effect, into Three
      Classes obliging the fortunate Adventurers in the first to receive a certain Number of Tickets
      in the Second in payment, in proportion To The Value of the prizes drawn, by which, a Sale
      will be insured, of so large a part of the next that the drawing will be punctually complied
      with-</P>

   <Title>MEMORIAL OF THE CAPTAINS OF THE PENNSYLVANIA GALLEYS 1</Title>
   <P>To the Honourable the Committee of Safety </P>
   <P>The Memorial of the Captains employed in the Provincial Armed Boats humbly sheweth - That they
      do not presume, nor would they by any means be understood by any One, to presume to dictate to
      them, whom they apprehend to have the sole Power of appointing any Gentleman they may think
      proper to the chief Command of the Armed Boats,2 yet they hope that they will be allowed,
      without giving the least Offence to any One of the Honourable Board, to offer a few things in
      their own Behalf; but would first observe, that it is not out of any dislike or disaffection
      to the Person, Character or Abilities, of the Gentleman it is reported will be appointed to
      that Command, but purely to vindicate their own Characters &amp; Honour, from any unjust
      Aspersions, that may be thrown upon them by Persons out of Doors, who may be entirely ignorant
      of the Matter or Cause of it - therefore they would observe -</P>
   <P>1st That when the Gentlemen who are honoured with the Command of those Boats first entered
      into the Service, it must be obvious to all, that it could not be out of any lucrative Views,
      but solely to serve the common Cause as far as lay in their power, &amp; fondly hope their
      Conduct as yet, has not been blamed or disapproved off by any of your Board</P>
   <P>2d That ever since their Appointment they have found the greatest Harmony to subsist among the
      Officers &amp; Men belonging to all the Boats, untill the other Night, when laying at the
      Island, on hearing the Report of a Commodore, who had not before belonged to any of the Boats,
      to be appointed, they conceive they have now some Cause to believe it will not long remain so
      among the Crews, tho' at same time they assure the Honourable Board, they will use every
      Endeavour to prevent any murmuring in their respective Boats</P>
   <P>3d They are of Opinion that there may be some of the Gentlemen already belonging to the Boats,
      who may be equally as well qualified for the Command, as perhaps many that can now be found in
      the Places, &amp; were in hopes, that the eldest Captain would be appointed to the Command,
      &amp; in Case of Removal by Death or otherwise, to be succeeded by the next eldest in Command,
      except found undeserving, which they apprehend to be the general Custom in the Navy, and are
      of Opinion it would tend to excite a Spirit of Bravery and Emulation among the Officers. - but
      this they humbly submitt to the Determination of the Board-</P>
   <P>Gentlemen - We have already declared &amp; must again repeat it, that the incontestable Right
      of appointing to any Command in the Armed Boats, must &amp; does belong to you, and that we
      never had any the least Intention in presenting this our undigested Memorial, drawn up in a
      Hurry, &amp; in many Parts incorrect &amp; imperfect, to give the least Umbrage or Offence, to
      any Gentleman of your Honourable Board, but only to pray if it is not already too late, &amp;
      that it can be done with Propriety, that you will be pleased to reconsider our Case - We are
      Gentlemen [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>[Halifax, October 31, 1775]</P>
   <P>1775 - The Rebellion in America growing more serious, and all hopes of bringing them back to
      their allegiance, otherwise than by force of arms, being at an end; The Ministry in the
      beginning of July came to a resolution to send out a considerable reinforcement of Troops
      &amp; Ships to Boston; In consequence of which I was appointed to command The Roebuck, a new
      Ship lately built at Chatham carrying 44 Guns. I sailed from England about the Midle of
      September, and after stopping a few days at Guernsey, a week at Fayal (one of the Western
      Islands, which in a great measure recoverd me out of a dangerous fever), I arrived at Halifax
      in <name>Nova Scotia</name>, in order to land <name>Comodore Arbuthnot</name> (who was appointed commander in chief in
      that Port and Commissioner of the Dock Yard there) on the 31st of October. I should from
      thence have proceeded imediately to Boston, but as it was well known that a large body of the
      Rebels had marched into Canada, and a probability that if they did not succeed there they
      might attempt to destroy the Dock Yard at Halifax, Mr Arbuthnot, who had also a Commission to
      command the Ships in the Harbour, thought proper to detain me, as well as the Somerset Captain
      Le eras for the better security of the Place; and it was certainly most necessary as at that
      time there were not above 300 Land forces in the Garrison. </P>

      &amp;c</P>
   <P>May it please your Excellency.</P>
   <P>We His Majesty's ever dutiful and loyal Subjects the Members of the Council and
      Representatives of this Province, met in General Assembly, having the most grateful Sense of
      our Sovereigns paternal Regard for all his faithful People, and particularly in the
      distinguish'd favors lately granted to the Inhabitants of this Province, and such as seek an
      Asylum therein from the other Colonies: Think it our duty to lay before your Excellency the
      Discouragement the trading part of the People meet with in their Commerce with Great Britain,
      the West India Islands, and also the Coasting Trade, by having their Seamen and other persons
      employ'd by them in that Business, impress'd and put on Board Ships of War which unless
      spedily prevented must utterly ruin the small Trade of this Province and deprive His Majesty's
      Subjects in the West Indies of that supply of Lumber and other necessary Articles which they
      would otherwise be furnish'd with from hence, and has a Tendency to prevent many well Affected
      persons from coming into the Province from the other Colonies which the Government at home
      seem desirous to encourage; and tho we are willing to contribute all in our Power at this time
      for the Aid &amp; Assistance of His Majesty's Forces in America, we cannot but feel for the
      distress'd State of Numbers in the Town of Halifax; on Account of the Scarcity of Fuel, and
      other necessary Supplies of which they will be deprived in a great Measure from the dread the
      Persons are under of being impress'd, who usually furnish'd the Town therewith.</P>
   <P>We therefore Request your Excellency will please to represent to His Majesty &amp; Ministers,
      the Distresses, if not total ruin of the Trade of this Province, where but few Seamen are to
      be had, should the practice of empressing them for the Ships of War be continued: That an
      Order may be procur'd from the Lords of the Admiralty to put a Stop thereto: In the mean time
      we pray your Excellency woud use your Influence with the Admiral at Boston and the Commanders
      of such of His Majesty's Ships as are now in the Harbour of Halifax, or may resort hither,
      that the Seamen belonging to Vessels owned in <name>Nova Scotia</name> may not be impress'd. Octobr 1775.2 </P>

   <P>Braintree Octo 31 1775. </P>
   <P>May it please your Excellency,</P>
   <P>My worthy and dear Friend Doctr [Benjamin] Franklin, the Honble Mr [James] Bowdoin, Doctr
      [James] Winthrop, and Doctr [Samuel] Cooper, were, the last Week, so kind as to honour me with
      a friendly Visit: - The Conversation naturally turned, upon the savage Cruelty we are dayly
      suffiering, from the unrelenting Vengeance of a tyrannical Government: In the Course of it,
      the stoping up the Harbor of Boston, as one salutary Measure, was thought well worthy the
      Attention of our State Pilots; and upon my saying I had once, if not more than once hinted the
      Scheme to your Excellency, they desired me to communicate my Sentiments to you, once more, in
      writing; especially, as I had lately received, a Letter from to honble <name>J: Adams</name> Esqr in
      Phildia, in Answer to one of mine, which seemed to throw new Light upon the Subject: This,
      Sir, I beg may be a sufficient Apology for transmitting to you the following Extracts of those
      Letters; with what has further occurred to my Mind, since they were wrote. - In my Letter I
      thus write . . . In my former Letter I said, &quot; &quot;the Harbor might be blocked up, and
      both Seamen &amp; Soldiers made Prisoners at Discretion,&quot;&quot; which seems to you
      incredible: - Please to read, at your Leasure the following Explanation: - There are but two
      Channels, through which ships of Burthen can safely pass, to and from Boston: - One of them
      runs, between the west Head of Long Island and the Moon, (so called) and is about a mile
      across: This is too shallow for any Ship of War above 20 Guns: - The Other is called the Ship
      Channel, and runs between the east Head of Long Island, and the south Point of Deer Island;
      and is something better than a Mile from Side to Side: This, the only Channel through which
      capital Ships can pass, leads, outward bound, through the Narrows, between Gallops Isld and
      Lovels Island, where the Channel is not wider than the Length of a 50 gun Ship: - In the
      Opening between Gallops Isld &amp; Georges Isld is Nantasket Road; where one Frigate is always
      stationed to gaurd the Narrows from being stoped up. - Upon these Facts I thus reason.</P>
   <P>The Moon Island communicates at low Water with Squantum Neck, almost dry shod: A defensible
      fort therefore, may be so placed upon Squantum, as to cover the Retreat not only from the
      Moon, but from Squantum to the Main. One upon the east Head of the Moon, and another on the
      west Head of Long Island, secures that Passage, and covers the Retreat from the Latter to the
      Former. Another upon the Summit in the middle of Long Island, covers the Shore on both Sides,
      so as that no Force can land without being greatly annoyed, if not intirely prevented. -
      Another strong Fort, with heavy Cannon, at the east Head of Long lsld, would command, not only
      the Ship Channel that runs by it, but the Narrows and Nantasket Road, so that no Ship could
      remain there with Safety, and consequently, we might by sinking Hulks in the Narrows, prevent,
      any Ship of Force from going out or coming in. - If the Passage through the Narrows is not
      stoped, I am sensible, that a Ship, with a fresh Gale of Wind and flood Tide, which is rapid
      between Long Island and Deer Island, might run through without any great Hazard: But, after
      the east Head of Long Island is fortified, I can forsee Nothing to hinder the Narrows being
      reduced, to such a Depth of Water, as that no Vessel of Force can pass through there: This
      being effected, as I said above, both Seamen and Soldiers, if they dont escape, by a timely
      Flight, must become Prisoners at Discretion. I have been told there is in one of the late
      English Magazines, an accurate Draft of the Harbor, which upon Examination will enable you to
      determine, with Precision, the Bearings &amp; Distances from Island to Island, and the Depth
      of Water between them; and consequently, whether such a Scheme is practicable or not. </P>
   <P>Mr Adams, in Answer writes thus. </P>
   <P>I am much obliged by your kind Explanation of your Opinion that the Harbor might be blocked
      up. - I must confess, altho I was born so near it, I never understood before the Course of the
      Channel, and the Situation of the Harbor so well. - I have carefully compared your Discription
      of Squantum, the Moon, Long Island, Gallop's Island, Lovel's Island, and George's; the Narrows
      and Nantasket Road, with &quot;A Plan of the Town and Chart of the Harbor of Boston,
      exhibiting a View of the Islands, Castle Fort, and Entrances into the said Harbor, which was
      published in London last February.&quot; This Plan I knew to be inaccurate in some
      Particulars, and the Chart may be so in others: but by the best Judgment I can make upon
      comparing your Facts with the Chart, and considering the Depth[s] of Water marked on this
      Chart, I think it extremely probable with you, that Nothing but Powder &amp; Cannon are
      wanting, to effect the important Purposes you mention, that of making Soldiers &amp; Sailors
      Prisoners at Discretion. </P>
   <P><name>Doctr Franklin</name>'s Row Gallies are in great forwardness: seven of them are completely manned
      armed, &amp;ca I weot down the River the other Day with all of them. I have as much Confidence
      in them as you have.* - But the People here have made Machines to be sunk in the Channel of
      Delaware River. Three Rowes of them are placed in the River, with large Timbers barbed with
      Iron. They are frames of Timber sunk with Stone - Machines very proper, for our Channel in the
      Narrows. </P>
   <P><name>Doctr Franklin</name> says they may be made in the Form of a <name>Chevaux de Frize</name> and used to great
      Advantage. </P>
   <P>I have wrote to Mr Adams for a Model of the Machines he mentions, with explicit Directions how
      to sink and secure them from being weighed or destroyed by the Enemies Ships. For my own Part,
      since I have read what my Friend has wrote, I am more than ever convinced, of the
      Practicability of not only securing the Harbour, but relieving the Town of Boston, by making
      the present Possessors of it our Prisoners; and that without shedding much more human Blood,
      provided we can once possess &amp; fortify long-Island. I doubt not, your Excellency will
      readily agree with me, that these are become objects of much greater Importance, since the
      Destruction of Falmouth demonstrates, the malicious Resolution of our barbarously civilized
      Enemies, to destroy all the rest of our Maritime Towns, if they can. </P>
   <P>If your Excellency should think the above Sentiments worthy of your Attention, and for
      maturing your Judgment, conclude it necessary to take an ocular View of the Harbour and
      Islands; please to accept of my cordial Invitation, to refresh or repose your Self at my
      House; where my Happiness will be in Proportion to the Freedom with which you receive the
      friendly Salutations of your Excellency's, [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Whereas, the Viper sloop of war, took the sloop Polly, <name>Samuel Barnes</name>, master, belonging to New
      York, bound from Antigua to new York, and put a midshipman as prize master, with several
      hands, on board, with orders to proceed with the said vessel and cargo to Boston; and also put
      on board <name>Isaac Eslick</name>, of Bristol, in this colony, as pilot of said sloop; promising the said
      Eslick, that in case he piloted the said sloop faithfully into the harbor of Boston, they
      would deliver up to him a boat taken from him, with the goods on board her, then in the
      possession of one of the enemy's ships. </P>
   <P>But the said Eslick, with two of the men belonging to said sloop, who were left on board,
      having with great address brought the said sloop into Seaconnet River, so that she, with her
      cargo, were recovered out of the hands of the enemy, and taken into the possession and care of
      General <name>Eseck Hopkins</name>, and thereby the said <name>Isaac Eslick</name> hath lost all hopes of recovering his
      said boat and goods; and, as in justice and equity, satisfaction and encouragement, in such
      cases, ought to be made and given, -</P>
   <P>It is voted and resolved, that the sum of $250, be paid to the said <name>Isaac Eslick</name>, and $50, to
      each of the other persons, instrumental in saving the said sloop, and cargo out of the enemy's
      hands, out of the value of the said sloop and cargo, in proportion to the properties of the
      several owners. </P>
   <P>It is voted and resolved, that <name>Ambrose Page</name>, Esq.; be requested to procure the two row
      gallies, belonging to the colony, to be immediately completed fit for service; and that he
      draw out of the general treasury, the sum of £400, lawful money, for the purpose, aforesaid. </P>
   <P>It is voted and resolved, with the consent of Mr. <name>John Brown</name>, that the colony will purchase
      the sloop Katy, as she now is, with her boats, stores and appurtenances, at the rate of
      $1,250. </P>
   <P>That the said <name>John Brown</name> be allowed the hire of said sloop, at the price agreed upon, from the
      12th day of June last, to this day, out of the general treasury. </P>

      12th day of June, in full compensation, without any allowance for hire. </P>
   <P>It is voted and resolved, that there be the same number of officers, and of the same kind,
      appointed for the row-gallies, as are appointed for the sloop Katy; that the officers and men
      of the row-gallies receive the same wages as are allowed to the officers and men of the sloop
      Washington. </P>
   <P>That <name>Ambrose Page</name>, Esq., be empowered to enter the men for the said rowgallies, to pay them
      one month's pay in advance, and to equip and fit them immediately for service; and that the

      1775 and in the 16th year of the Reign of His Majesty <name>King George</name> the third &amp;c-</P>
   <P>This deponent saith, that on the 14th of June 1775 or thereabouts, he was Spoke to by Mr
      <name>Thomas Newton</name> of Norfolk who informed him that the Treasurer wished to Speak to him on some
      business, that he this deponent, and the aforesaid <name>Thomas Newton</name>, went together to
      Williamsburg in a day, or two thereafter, where they both Spoke with <name>Robert Carter Nicholas</name>
      the Treasurer of the Colony of Virginia, who informed him that Gun Powder must be had for the
      use of the Colony at any price, he Nicholas, asked this deponent whether he would not
      undertake to procure Gun Powder from the French or Dutch Islands, or any other of the Western
      Islands, to which this deponent agreed, but referred the price for such Services to the
      General Assembly, and that he then asked the aforesaid Nicholas and Newton, whether his
      bringing Powder might not endanger his Life, to which they both replyed in the Negative, but
      said it might be the means of forfeiting his Vessel, that he this deponent received for the
      aforesaid purpose the sum of £5000 in bills of Exchange drawn by the aforesaid Nicholas on
      <name>Messrs Norton</name> and Sons in London, payable to the said <name>Thomas Newton</name>, who endorsed the same to
      this deponent, who in consequence thereof sailed for the Island of Antigua, on the 15th of
      July or thereabouts, as near as he can recollect, where he could not procure a:ny Gun Powder,
      but Sold bills to the Amount of £500 for Cash to different People there, and from thence
      proceeded on his Voyage to St Eustatia where he sold bills to the amount of £2000 more, and
      then deposited the Sum of £500 or thereabouts with a certain Mr <name>Isaac Vandam</name>, Merchant there,
      who undertook to pay for Powder, as he should receive it from Mr Bartrand of St Pierre's,
      Martinico, the aftersaid Mr Bartrand was to purchase the Powder, and send it from thence to
      the aforesaid Mr Vandam at St Eustatia, who was to Store, and take care of it till such time
      as Vessels should arrive from Virginia to convey it thither. This deponent further saith that
      he proceeded from St Eustatia to Martinico but there he could not procure any Powder, and
      being narrowly watched as he supposed by some English Officers who came from English Harbor he
      returned immediately to St Eustatia, where the aforesaid Mr Bartrand sent him 1800wt of Gun
      Powder in a french bottom, while he was laying there a small English Guinea Ship arrived from
      Antigua who sold him 1600w of Gun Powder, where he also purchased 750w more out of a French
      Schooner from Martinico. This deponent saitih that he sailed from St Eustatia the 1st of
      October last, and from thence proceeded to Ockriock River in the Province of North Carolina,
      where he arrived on the 9th of October, so Soon as he got on Shore, he made what dispatch he
      could to Williamsburg, and informed the aforesaid Nicholas, Treasurer, that he had brought in
      between 4 &amp; 5000w of Gun Powder, who seemed very well Satisfied. And this deponent further
      saith that, on his return from Williamsburg, he met the greatest part, if not the whole of the
      Gun Powder in two Waggons, escorted by a Number of Armed Men who, were conveying it up the
      Country. And further this deponent sayeth not. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>London, 11 August 1775 </P>
   <P>No. 288</P>
   <P>I can only approve, Sir, your views on America and England. You understand what goes on and
      you cunningly anticipate what will happen as if you were there; a destroyed or worthless
      America is what England seeks. I agree with you, Sir, and it is in this line of thought that
      the Council of the King must face the present events and determine its plans for the future. I
      do not doubt for one moment, from what I overheard among the Ministers of the King of England,
      that the decision has been made at the Council of this Prince to annihilate America if they
      cannot subdue her, to burn the cities, the ships, the forests and to turn this country into a
      desert. This plan would be carried out in a spirit of revenge and out of spite; it would even
      be the outcome of a barbaric policy indeed, but the only one which in the present situation
      could serve the interest of England, since it is established that henceforth America will
      hardly be her slave, never her ally, and for ever her enemy. This principle must govern all
      the resolutions which will be adopted by this power . . . .</P>
   <P>We have received no interesting news from Boston unless it has been made a secret. The
      Ministers claim that they received letters dated on the 27th of June and that at that time
      nothing had happened since to <name>Charles Town</name> affair. I am certain that they will stand on the
      defensive until next year and I would not be surprised if that campaign began in New York
      since Boston is some sort of a box of which it is very difficult to come out. But what an
      enormous expense for England! A considerable sum of money will have to be voted during the
      next session of Parliament, and it will hardly be less expensive for England to wage war on
      her Colonies than on France. This comparison of facts should become the subject matter of
      important discussions. </P>

   <P>By the Hancock and Adams, arrived from Philadelphia, we learn, that the 13 transports, with
      the troops shipped at Corke, amounting, Officers included, to 1700 men, arrived at New York
      the 23d of June, in health and spirits; but not a living creature had landed there, though no
      opposition had been made to their debarkation: . . . The same accounts advise) that the
      Nautilus sloop of war had arrived the day after the transports, with an express from General
      Gage to their commanding Officer, by which it is thought they had received orders to sail to
      Boston. </P>

   <P>Lord Sandwich - I never doubted that your great activity would soon vanquish any apparent
      difficulty in engaging the number of transports required for the two present services, and I
      trust that will secure their being with the utmost expedition fitted out and sent out of the
      River.</P>
   <P>It is but right to be grateful when kindly treated: it is that makes me rejoice that
      Portsmouth is the first dock which seems returning to its duty. 2 I do not doubt but
      twenty-one shipwrights having set the example, there will not be a want of hands in that dock
      in a very few days, which will bring the others to reason. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Versailles, 13 August 1775 </P>
   <P>No. 148</P>
   <P>I had the honor, Sir, to receive your letter No. 287 which you wrote to me on the 4th of the
      month. If the letter which I sent you on the seventh reached you before you had a meeting with
      Lord Rochford, it will have explained to you that we can wait with patience for a satisfactory
      agreement on our rights in Newfoundland 2 and that, while we do not intend to lose sight of
      this affair, we do not wish to place upon it an emphasis which might dispose the British
      Ministry to believe that we are trying to take advantage of their difficulties and force them
      into a compromise. It is not the King's intention to place the Ministry in jeopardy since it
      already occupies a most unstable position; were it possible, we Would make every effort in
      order to support it rather than strive to overthrow it. Once and for all, Sir, proceed with
      the negotiations, but use enough moderation so that neither Lord Rochford nor any of his
      colleagues may presume that we are attempting to embarass them personally. Our cause is fair,
      our right is established and the evidence is in our favor. We demand that our rights to make
      use of the Coast of Bonavista as defined in the peace-treaty of Utrecht be restored or that we
      be granted a suitable equivalent.</P>
   <P>It will not be long before we know if the British suffered a defeat in America; it is to the
      insurgents' advantage to make their advances known and they certainly were able to find a way
      by which to spread such news. The expedition of fine Regiments of the division of Ireland to
      which three Cavalry regiments might be added proves that the Ministry deems necessary to make
      the greatest efforts to maintain their position in that country and take command of the
      situation. I would think, Sir, that such would be the intention of the Ministry if the sending
      of these three Cavalry Regiments were verified; this kind of troops would be most awkward and
      quite useless, should they wish to insult our Islands and conquer them. However, the more the
      British increase their forces in that part of the World, the more we must guard against any
      harmful use they might be tempted to make of them. Anything is to be feared on the part of a
      Nation which behaves more often out of despair than on a matter of principle. </P>
   <P>. . . What is essential for us is that we be informed in time of the movements in the ports.
      It would seem difficult to suspect the British Ministry .of scheming against their neighbours
      as long as they limit their armaments to ships of fifty cannons, frigates and corvettes. </P>

      firmness, refuse and disdain a service, that is to annihilate their liberties, and ruin their
      country. - Lond. Packet.</P>
   <P>By order of the Lords of the Admiralty, no less than twelve frigates and sloops of war have
      been built in private yards, which are all ready for sea.</P>
   <P>On Friday last [August 11] a survey was made of all the merchant ships in the river, fit to be
      emplryed in the service of the Government, and a report was made of them yesterday to the

   <P>Eight thousand tons of transports are already taken up in the river, and more are expected to
      offer daily; twenty-five flat-bottomed boats are nearly constructed for the debarkation of

   <P>We are exceedingly concerned to find the breach between England and America so much widened,
      we were in hopes some measures might have been adopted to prevent Bloodshed; but our great
      people in power are gone to farr to retreat, and although they are convinced the measures has
      been too hasty, they say they Know not how to retreat, we are very sencible it must very
      materially Effect us on this side, as well as being very destructive to America, our

   <P>Happy we are to find that our American friends are sincible that the Merchants on this side
      has been very streaniousely using their Endeavours to prevent its present Course, but hitherto

      distressed Merchants here who must inexpressibly feel the want of the American Trade, but much
      more the withholding payments. We flatter our Selves that the distance you are from the Seat

   <P><name>My Lord</name>,</P>
   <P>In consequence of Your Lordship's Letter N. 9. I waited upon the <name>Marquis Tanucci</name> and made the
      proper application for obstructing the Exportation of Gunpowder or other Warlike Stores from
      Naples or any of His Sicilian Majesty's Dominions to the British Colonies in America. The
      Marquis answer'd that He was very sure that His Sicilian Majesty wou'd be happy upon this, as
      upon every other occasion, to give a proof of His Friendship and Esteem for His Britannic
      Majesty, and made no doubt but that He shou'd be authorized to acquaint me very soon, that the
      necessary Orders had been issued to prevent the above mention'd Exportation. </P>
   <P>I have made the most diligent enquiry and do not believe that any Warlike Stores have been as
      yet exported from these Kingdoms to our Colonies in America. </P>
   <P>There are Newfoundland Ships that come here every Season with Baccala, and I have known a Ship
      or two come here directly from New York, but very rarely. </P>
   <P>Your Lordship may be assured that I shall be particularly attentive that His Majesty's desire
      may be strictly complied with, the only danger is from the Counterband which the French carry
      on in Small Vessels upon the extended Coast of these Kingdoms, and indeed the <name>Marquis Tanucci</name>
      hinted to me the frequency of such Counterbands as well as the difficulty of preventing them,
      hoping that if any such accident shou'd happen, in the present case, it might not be
      attributed to this Government, who wou'd certainly take every measure to prevent it. </P>
   <P>I return Your Lordship many thanks for the Gazette with the account of the defeat of a party
      of the Rebels in America, I trust in God that these unfortunate and deluded people will soon
      be brought to a just sense of their crimes, and submit again to the mild Government of the
      Mother Country, the time value of which they do not seem to have known. I have the honor to be

   <P>The Spirit of America is incredible. Who do you think the Mr [Thomas] Mifflin, Aid de Camp to
      Washington, is? - A very grave and staunch Quaker, of large fortune and much consequence. What
      think you of that political Enthusiasm, which is able to overpower so much religious
      Fanaticism? Washington himself is a man of good Military experience, prudent and Cautious, and
      who yet stakes a fortune of about 5000 a year. God knows they are very inferiour in all human
      rescources. But a remote and difficult Country, and such a Spirit as now animates them, may do
      strange things. Our Victories can only complete our Ruin. </P>

   <P>Whereas the Earl of Suffolk one of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State acquainted us,
      by his Letter of the 14h Instant, that, upon Intelligence received that several Vessels bound
      to North America from the Port of London had taken on board Arms and Ammunition orders were
      given to the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs to direct their Officers to search those
      Vessels but that there was reason to apprehend that the Intention of such search had been, and
      would be, eluded by Vessels bound to North America taking in Arms and Ammunition after they
      get below Gravesend; and whereas it hath been represented to our Secretary, by Letter from his
      Lordship's office of Yesterday's date, that further orders have been given to the said
      Commissioners to station two or three Cutters for visiting and searching all Vessels bound to
      North America in their passage from the River to the Downes, and that, in case the Officers of
      such Cutters shall stand in need of the Assistance of His Majesty's Ships, they do, upon
      coming in sight of such Ships, hoist a Custom House Jack at the Mast head; You are hereby
      required and directed to repair in the Sloop you command, without a moment's loss of time,
      into the five fathom Channel, and use your best endeavours to intercept, seize, and bring into
      Port, all Ships and Vessels having on board Gunpowder, arms, or ammunition prohibited to be
      carried Coastwise or to be transported into Ports beyond the Seas by His Majesty's order in
      Council of the 5h of April last (which with our order thereupon is herewith sent to you) and
      in case any Cutters, or other Vessels belonging to the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs
      shall come in sight and make the Signal above mentioned, you are to give their Officers
      respectively such assistance as they may stand in need of in intercepting, visiting, and
      searching Vessels bound to North America, and if such Vessels shall have any of the
      abovementioned Articles on board without a proper licence for that purpose in conveying them
      afterwards in safety into the first convenient Port to be proceeded against according to Law.

   <P><name>Mylord Sandwich</name> himself assured me day before yesterday that they would not send a single ship
      carrying more than fifty cannons to America. Admiral Shaldam [Shuldham] will command the
      squadron which is to sail any day now. The recall of Admiral Graves and that of General Gage
      have not been decided yet. The entire Council of the King of England does not seem to be
      favorably disposed towards them. I still persist in believing that they will lose their
      commands because they have been made responsible for all the defeats. I am far from thinking
      that their conduct is without reproach, but they deserve mostly to be blamed for having
      imagined the war in America. However, <name>Mylord Sandwich</name> himself is privately conceived that the
      Americans will grow weary and that Great Britain will subdue them by force. I must confess I
      think that these people are delirious. There can be no conciliation, we are certain of that

   <P>That We have further thought fit to enact, and We do hereby enact, that, during the aforesaid

      Ammunition shall have been embarked, and his Ship be answerable and liable to Execution for
      the said Fine. </P>

   <P>Whereas many of our subjects in diverse parts of our Colonies and Plantations: in
      North-America, misled by dangerous and ill-designing men, and forgetting the allegiance which
      they owe to the power that has protected and sustained them, after various disorderly acts
      committed in disturbance of the public peace, to the obstruction of lawful commerce, and to
      the oppression of our loyal subjects carrying on the fame, have at length proceeded to an open
      and avowed Rebellion, by arraying themselves in hostile manner, to withstand the execution of
      the law, and traitorously preparing, ordering, and levying war against us: And whereas there
      is reason to apprehend that such Rebellion hath been much promoted and encouraged by the
      traitorous correspondence, counsels, and comfort of divers wicked and desperate persons within
      the realm: To the end therefore that none of our subjects may neglect or violate their duty
      through ignorance thereof, or through any doubt of the protection which the law will afford to
      their loyalty and zeal, we have thought fit, by and with the advice of our Privy Council, to
      issue this our Royal Proclamation, hereby declaring, that not only all our officers, civil and
      military, are obliged to exert their utmost endeavours to suppress such Rebellion, and to
      bring the traitors to justice; but that all our subjects of this realm, and the dominions
      thereunto belonging, are bound by law to be aiding and assisting in the suppression of such
      Rebellion, and to disclose and make known traitorous conspiracies and attempts against us, our
      Crown and dignity; and we do accordingly strictly charge and command all our officers, as well
      civil as military, and all other our obedient and loyal subjects, to use their utmost
      endeavours to withstand and suppress such Rebellion, and to disclose and make known all
      treasons and traitorous conspiracies which they shall know to be against us, our Crown and
      dignity; and for that purpose, that they transmit to one of our principal Secretaries of
      State, or other proper officer, due and full information of all persons who shall be found
      carrying on correspondence with, or in any manner or degree aiding or abetting the persons now
      in open Arms and Rebellion against our government within any of our Colonies and Plantations

   <P>Kew, August 25, 1775, 46 m. past 4 p.m.</P>
   <P>Lord Sandwich-The letters from Vice-Admiral Graves seem to convey his being attentive to his
      duty. The more frigates can be speedily sent to reinforce his squadron the better. I approve
      of the directions for seizing all American vessels in the Mediterranean, the coast of Africa,
      or trading to the ports of foreign powers in the West Indies. </P>

   <Title>LORD SANDWICH TO VICE ADMIRAL <name>SAMUEL GRAVES</name> 1</Title>
   <P>Private.</P>
   <P>Admiralty, 25th August 1775.</P>
   <P>Dear Sir,-As you will now have a very great naval force under your command, and as the eyes of
      all the world are now fixed on your operations, I think it incumbent upon me to speak freely
      to you, and to tell you the general opinion of mankind here with regard to the state of
      affairs in America.</P>
   <P>The nation (except some factious and interested opponents) are in a manner unanimous in their
      resolution to crush the unnatural rebellion that has broke out in America by force of arms,
      which to our great concern we find now to be the only expedient left; and as I have told you
      in former letters, you will be liable to universal censure for doing too little, though I
      should be greatly surprised if you incurred any blame by rather overdoing your part in the
      other extreme. </P>
   <P>I think I should not perform the part of a friend, if I endeavoured to conceal from you that
      the world in general has been full of complaints that the fleet does nothing; and that in
      particular fresh provisions are wanted at Boston, which the ships have it in their power to
      procure: they say that you do not consider the rebellious colonies as a people you are
      actually at war with; and that though they take every advantage in their power in order to
      starve the navy and army, you seem to have delicacies about taking possession of whatever is
      wanted for subsistence or in aid of your operations. </P>
   <P>Though this language is chiefly in the mouths of those who are unacquainted with your force
      and of the extensive services that your fleet is to be employed in, yet still the idea of your
      doing too little has been so prevalent that it is with great difficulty that I have been able
      to resist the general cry for another commander. I have however resisted it hitherto; and I am
      persuaded that you will give me fresh materials before the end of the campaign to confirm what
      I have asserted, namely that you will exert every nerve in support of the important business
      you are engaged in. </P>
   <P>You are going to be greatly reinforced and to have a very able rear-admiral to command under
      you; with that assistance, I think you will soon show the rebels the weight of an English
      fleet. </P>
   <P>If - we had any bomb-vessels ready, I should send them out directly, as I imagine they may be
      of use; at all events, you shall have a couple early in the spring. </P>
   <P>Whatever wants you may have, let us know them, and you may be assured you shall be supplied
      liberally, as there is not the least intention of starving the cause. </P>
   <P>It is impossible to think of directing your particular operations here; but it occurs to me
      that with a fleet that is master of the sea and with so large a number of transports ready to
      convey troops to any part of the continent, a diversion might be made to the southward which
      would embarrass your opponents and take them unprepared: I own I should be very happy to hear
      that such a plan was in agitation, and have no doubt but that you would give it every kind of
      encouragement. </P>
   <P>I have always understood that Rhode Island and other places in rebellion are open to the sea
      and have plenty of cattle and stock. I think by means of your fleet you might contrive to
      force them to supply your :wants. However, as I have already said, I do not pretend to point
      out any particular operations, I only mean to perform the duty of a friend by holding out to
      your view the rock you may split upon and by laying open the channel through which it may be
      avoided. I am [&amp;c.] </P>

      which will keep good for many Months, especially if She can be dispatched so as to arrive at
      Boston before the Frost sets in, which seldom happens 'till after Christmas; and while I am
      writing upon this subject may I be permitted to add, that it would be greatly instrumental in
      answering the above purpose, if a small Vessel of 80 or 100 Tons, was to Sail from Lisbon or
      Oporto with Onions, Oranges, Lemons, &amp;ca by the End of October,3 and another of the same

      be Authorized to send a small Vessel at proper Seasons to the Bahama Islands for Turtle,
      Oranges, Chaddocks, Limes &amp;ca, the want of the usual and necessary refreshments will by

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>London, 1 September 1775</P>
   <P>No. 290 </P>
   <P>Once again I assured Myd Suffolk of the intentions of the King and his sense of Justice which
      would prevent His Majesty to ever encourage the disorders in America. I thought it was all the
      more necessary to insist on this point because I know for a fact that a British frigate seized
      a ship sent to Europe by the Americans and that among the papers they found a manifesto
      addressed to a European power requesting protection. </P>
   <P>As I wrote to you in my last dispatch, Sir, I suspected that the King of England was no longer
      ill-disposed towards the King of Prussia and I decided to make some discreet inquiries on this
      matter. I gave this assignment to a person who has often served us well. He learned from a man
      associated with the Exchequer, also an intimate friend of Lord North, that the disagreement
      which came up between the Courts of Berlin and Petersburg determined the King of Prussia to
      turn to England. Good relations have been restored for several months. The King of England is
      greatly pleased by this turn of events and he sacrificed his personal feelings to the
      requirements of this occasion. I was led to believe that the King of Prussia has pledged his
      German states to His British Majesty and exerted his influence at the States General to the
      effect that the German subjects were forbidden to export powder and war ammunition . . . </P>
   <P>I must not end this letter, Sir, without giving you a most favorable account of the trip which
      Mr. <name>de la Mouliere</name> has just taken in Northern England. He has completely fulfilled the object
      of his mission which is most important to the Royal Navy where I have always heard that
      cannons made of iron are dangerous. The British Navy does not object to them: they are lighter
      than ours and they do not explode. These are recognized facts and cast-bronze cannon are no
      longer used on the lower deck of the largest ships. Mr. <name>de la Mouliere</name> has acquired enough
      information to start manufacturing these cannon in France, undoubtedly to our greatest
      advantage. </P>
   <P>News from the Ports </P>
   <P>Plymouth.</P>
   <P>Raisonable is in dry-dock since 1 July and repairs will last for the next eight months. This
      ship is not being put into commission and has been replaced by Nonsuch, 64 cannon.</P>
   <P>Kent, 74 cannon, has been returned to the reserve and is almost entirely unrigged. Foudroiant,
      [Foudroyant] 80 cannon, is fully rigged but has not yet been put into commission.</P>
   <P>The frigate Orpheus which is being put into commission is fully rigged. Work is being urged on
      the frigate Solebay, but she will not be ready for another six weeks.</P>
   <P>The order has been received to repair Ocean, however it cannot be carried out because no
      dry-dock is available. </P>
   <P>The corvette Wolfe [Wolf] has just returned from Ireland.</P>
   <P>The Cutter Polkton [Folkstone] which had sailed early last month for America was unable to
      proceed on her way and returned to this port. 2 </P>

   <P>The frigate Pallas arrived from the Coast of Guinea and lately from Jamaica.</P>
   <P>The corvette Carcass sailed for the Thames.</P>
   <P>There are in Spithead three transport ships and two store ships. They are carrying 400 men of
      the corps of Artillery and war ammunition for Boston. They are waiting for a convoy. Also in
      Spithead are Phoenix and Roebuck. The former is destined for Halifax, the latter for Boston.
      120 marines went on board the Roebuck on the 26th of this month.</P>
   <P>In addition to these ships now at Spithead there are six reserve vessels and the Corvette
      Racehorse.</P>
   <P>The two reserve ships Chatham and Renown are in port.</P>
   <P>The corvette Weazle [Weasel] and the schooner Magdelaine [Magdalen] are in dry-dock.</P>
   <P>The frigate Acteon [Actaeon] ran aground on the Island of Wight.</P>
   <P>The frigate Pearl is to be put into commission. </P>
   <P>Chatham</P>
   <P>The frigate Boreas, 28 cannon, is being put into commission.</P>
   <P>Experiment is going to sail for the Downs.</P>

   <P>Whitehall 5th Septr 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>After having, in my Separate Letter of this day's date said so much upon the ideas which have
      been adopted of the great risque &amp; little advantage that are to be expected from the Army
      continuing at Boston during the Winter season, unless a more favourable Prospect opens, &amp;
      having also repeatedly suggested the advantages of recovering possession of New York, I have
      nothing to add upon those material Objects of your consideration; but as it is of very great
      Importance that you should know upon what ground we entertain a confident hope of having a
      large Army in North America in the Spring, I should be unpardonable if I did not acquaint you
      that His Majesty's Minister at Petersburgh having been instructed to sound the Empress, how
      far she would be disposed, in case of necessity, to assist His Majesty with such Force as the
      state &amp; security of the Empire would admit; Her Imperial Majesty has, in the fullness of
      her affection for the British Nation, &amp; of gratitude for the benefits she received under
      her late difficulties, made the most explicit declaration, &amp; given the most ample
      Assurances, of letting us have any number of Infantry that may be wanted.</P>
   <P>In consequence of this generous and magnanimous Offer, a Requisition has been made for Twenty
      Thousand Men, &amp; it is proposed to send the greatest part of the Auxiliaries, as early as
      possible in the Spring to Quebec; And I trust we shall have at least an equal number of
      British Troops in North America to act with them, if Occasion requires. I am &amp;c.</P>

   <P>As it is of great consequence to His Majesty's Service in the present State of Affairs in

      other Services than those to which they are appointed by the Admiral; I am commanded by The

      any such Ships that may be stationed within the limits of your Government with any
      Dispatches,2 unless such Dispatches are of the most pressing Nature and no Vessel can be

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>London Sept 5: 1775</P>
   <P>Dear Sir</P>
   <P>Since my last, I have received your several favors of the 6th &amp; 30th June, and 2d July the
      last of which came by the Adventure, who arrived about three Weeks agoe - I am very sorry you
      was so Ill at Fredk Town and that you suffer'd so much in getting home from thence, But this
      Cursed Scheme of business we are engaged in conducted upon the Plan it has, and attended with
      the difficulties which have Attended it, is enought to kill us all, and will in my Opinion do
      it yet, before we have done with it; for my own part I now find, I scarce knew what Trouble
      was, before the difficulties of my Situation in business here, made me Acquainted with it, and
      since that time I have known little else, to the destroying of my Health as well as the
      ruining of my peace and quiet, However it Availeth not to complain, and this I ought to know
      full well from experience, but at sometimes it is a hard matter to be silent - . . .</P>
   <P>This Letter I intend shall come by the Rachell Capt [James] Tibbett, a Vessel belonging to
      Maryland and the only Opportunity that I know of that we shall have for some time to come, for
      which reason I have sent by him the Sales of the Tobacco received p the Camden, the Baltimore
      Packet, the Generous Freends, and the Patty - . . . With respect to Tobacco matters I have to
      tell you that I have Landed two Lighters from Onboard of the Adventure, but have not as yet
      sold a Single Hogshead, I have been Offerd 3 5/8. pt round for one of them, and could have
      that price whenever I please for both but I want and hope - to get 3 3/4 for them in a few
      days more, but the Sale for Tobacco at present is exceeding dull much more so than ever I saw
      it at this time of the year before, and the Markets every where very full. As to Publick News
      there is nothing particular that I know of, and even if there was, a Proclamation has within
      these few days been Issued making it high Treason to hold any Correspondence with America on
      Publick Affairs . . . </P>

   <Title><name>PHILIP STEPHENS</name> TO VICE ADMIRAL <name>SAMUEL GRAVES</name> </Title>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>[Admiralty Office] 6th Sepr 1775</P>
   <P>I have received and communicated to my Lords Commissrs of the Admty your Letters of the 16th
      &amp; 18th of July, giving account of your proceedings up to that time; And in return I have
      the satisfaction to acquaint you that their Lordships very well approve thereof.</P>
   <P>Their Lordships had previous to the receipt of the abovementioned Letters, signified to Capt.
      Montagu, their approbation of his having sent to England the Magdalen Schooner with Lord
      Dunmore's dispatches, as they were represented to him to be, and really were of great
      importance: But their Lordships command me to acquaint you that they entirely concur with you
      in opinion that it is a precedent which ought not to be drawn into practise; and that no part
      of your Squadron should at any time be sent to England at the requisition of any of the
      Governors of His Majts Colonies, without your orders, unless the service be of a very pressing
      nature and no Vessel can be hired in which an Officer might carry dispatches not safe to be
      trusted with the Master; And their Lordships recommend it to you to signify the same to the
      respective Officers of your Squadron; They having on their part desired the Earl of Dartmouth
      to take the Kings pleasure for writing to the several Governors to the same effect: </P>
   <P>The Lizard sailed from Spithead the 16th Ultimo, with the <name>Jacob Storeship</name> laden with Arms and
      Military Cloathing &amp; Stores for Quebec, as did the Actaeon from the Downs on the 24th with
      the <name>Maria Storeship</name>, laden in like manner for Virginia; But the latter (the Actaeon) having
      unfortunately struck upon the Shingles it will be necessary to examine her bottom before she
      proceeds to Sea. Their Lordships have therefore ordered the Liverpool to convoy the Maria
      Storeship to Virginia, and perform the Service, specified in the inclosed Copy of her Orders,
      instead of the Actaeon, which will have her damages made good, and be sent to join you at
      Boston as soon as possible. The Roebuck is ready and will sail with the first opportunity of
      Wind &amp; Weather to Halifax with Commissioner Arbuthnot, and from thence as soon as she has
      landed him, to Boston; The Centurion, Experiment &amp; Renown, and some others of the Ships
      mentioned in my last Letters are in great forwardness and will soon follow. </P>
   <P>My Lords have since I wrote to you last ordered the Boreas &amp; Triton of 20 Guns each, to be
      fitted out to join you. And it is their intention to send two more 50 Gunships, two Bombs, and
      as many more Frigates as can conveniently be got ready to reinforce you early in the
      Spring.</P>
   <P>When these Reinforcements arrive, you will have a very numerous Fleet under your command,
      Their Lordships therefore recommend it to you in the mean time to consider and to let them
      know as soon as you have an opportunity, whether the addition of an Hospital Ship, will be of
      advantage to the Service and if you think it will, whether any of the Transports at Boston can
      be fitted for that purpose, and whether you have a sufficient number of Surgeons, or Surgeon's
      Mates to put on board her, or what supply of them you shall want to have sent from hence </P>
   <P>Their Lordships taking into consideration the difficulties of obtaining fresh Provisions for
      the Crews of the Ships under your command, as well as for the men who may be sick in the
      Hospital, have directed the Commissrs for Sick &amp; Hurt Seamen to send to Boston by the
      first opportunity, Five Thousand Pounds weight of Portable Soup, consigned to you, to be
      served on board the Squadron to the men in health, as well as those who may be sick as you
      shall have occasion; Their Lordships have also directed them to send One Thousand Pounds
      Weight of the said Soup for the use of the Hospital at Boston, and Two hundred Pounds weight
      for the use of the Marine Infirmary there. Their Lordships moreover intend to order the
      Commissrs for Victualing to send from time to time to Boston, a Vessel laden with Potatoes
      &amp; Carrots for the use of the Fleet, And they recommend it to you to consider whether it
      might not contribute greatly to the keeping the men in health if you were to send at proper
      seasons a sm2.ll Vessel to the Bahama Islands for Turtles, Oranges, Limes &amp; Shaddocks,
      &amp; such other refreshments, as may be procured there. I am &amp;c </P>

   <P>My dear Lord-I know you are so zealous in our cause against the American rebels that I should
      not act with that confidence I have in you, if I concealed from you the bitter complaints that
      have come home against Admiral Graves. Officers of distinction have written a state of facts
      that cannot be contradicted: such as, that many of our vessels have been taken, officers
      killed, men made prisoners; that a great number of swift boats called whale-boats have been
      supplied to the enemy from well-known towns on the coast, in which boats they have insulted
      and plundered islands immediately under the protection of our ships, and at noonday landed in
      force and burned the lighthouse almost under the guns of two or three men of war. The officers
      who write this ask where an excuse can be found for not enforcing instant restitution and
      reparation, or laying the towns in ashes where boats had been furnished, privateers fitted
      out, prizes carried in, or provisions refused. These are heavy charges, and I confess I do not
      see how they can be answered. The King, who is apprised of all this, has authorized me to tell
      you that he does not see, after every letter laying such blame on him (the Admiral) , how the
      command can any longer be left in such improper hands. You will forgive me writing thus
      confidentially: we both mean with active zeal to promote the cause in which we are embarked; I
      am confident, therefore, that you will listen to any proposal that will m the smallest degree
      tend to forward the service. I am [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>I beg you will be pleased to inform my Lords of the Admiralty, with the Arrival of His
      Majesty's Sloop Alderney under my Command, this day, at Spithead, from a Cruize in persuance
      of their Lordships Orders given to me by Vice Admiral [John] Amherst at Plymouth.</P>
   <P>On the 29th Ulto I fell in and spoke with the Freindship, a Sloop from Guernsey, bound to
      Plymouth - she informed us that a Brigg had just arrived at Guernsey bound to America, and by
      his account of her she seem'd to answer the discription of the May Flower Brigantine,
      specified in their Lordships directions, respecting the Vessels at Amsterdam.</P>
   <P>The next day I run into Guernsey Road, and inspected all the Vessels there, and amongst them
      found a Brigg Called the Lord Chatham from Virginia, Laden with Tobacco and Staves; the former
      part of her Cargoe she landed at Falmouth and brought the Staves only for Guernsey. Conversing
      with Mainjay [<name>Nicholas Maingy</name>] the Master, on the state of America, he gave me to understand
      the Virginians were Arming &amp; Excersing themselves every where but very much wanted Gun
      Powder and had dispatched a number of Vessels to the West Indies and Europe for it - In his
      conversation he mentioned Lord Dunmores having sailed from Virginia in his Majesty's ship
      Fowey. The Brigg left Virginia the 13th July last. Amongst his Papers I found only One Letter
      that touched on American Affairs, the which I send you inclosed - I sufferd the Gentleman a
      Merchant of Guernsey, to whom it is directed to read it and then Sailed -</P>
   <P>During the whole Cruize we have had very Boisterous weather, and frequent hard gales, in one
      of them I was glad to run into Portland Road for shelter -</P>
   <P>In the Channel I spoke with several Vessels bound to America, in Ballast only, all well found
      and fine sightly Vessels. - None however came from Amsterdam, or Answered the description
      given with my Orders. I have the honor to be Sir [&amp;c.]</P>

      lawful prizes if they are caught by British ships and their Captains will be severely
      punished. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>I observed, that one main Cause of the supine negligence of several principal Traders, was
      this. They had formed a confused opinion, that things would come of themselves to an amicable
      settlement. They have been so often alarmed, that many of them cannot believe the present
      troubles to be any thing more than an alarm. On this delusive supposition, they go on filling
      their Warehouses with Goods, exhausting their Capital to the last farthing, and even borrowing
      upon Interest wherever they can borrow. They say that this is the third non-importation
      agreement of the North Americans. That the two former had broken up much to the advantage of
      the Merchants, and particularly the second. They had then a demand with twenty per Cent,
      advance, on every thing; which paid them amply for the delay. They even sold at that advanced
      price, goods of such a quality, as at other times they could not sell at any price at all. Mr
      Bull, one of the greatest dealers in Bristol, and who alone employs four hundred men, has not
      actually dismissed so many as fifty; the rest he employs at half and quarter work, as it is
      called, in hopes, which at length begin to fail him, that a reconciliation will take place. He
      is fearful, that if he should now dismiss them in a body, that he may not be able to recover
      them on the return of the Trade. For my part my apprehensions are, that from their irresolute
      and dodging motions, the evil will be gradual and therefore incurable. The Merchants in that
      Trade will break, after the manufacturers have perished insensibly, and melted down without
      Notice into the mass of the National Wretchedness. But this, in my opinion may be in some sort
      prevented, if but one tenth part of the pains are taken to shew them their danger, which have
      been, and are employd to keep them quiet by false representations and delusive hopes.</P>

   <P>As Lord Stormont 2 intends soon to return to Paris, I shall fully discuss every point of
      business with His Lordship that relates to the Court where you reside and for that reason
      there is less occasion for my writing to you at present so particularly thereon as I otherwise
      should do, but I cannot defer mentioning to you the general Opinion entertained here that the
      American Rebels are constantly assisted by the french Nation as well from Europe as from their
      American Islands. I could not avoid taking notice of it last week to Count <name>de Guines</name>, and
      confirmed it to him afterwards in a note to which I received answer as you will see by the
      inclosed copy. It is probable that the Count <name>de Vergennes</name> may think it necessary to repeat to
      You the same assurances the french Ambassador here is persuaded he shall have Orders to give,
      but whether <name>Monsr <name>de Vergennes</name></name> speaks to you or not upon that subject, it is highly proper you
      should tell him that Advice has been received from the Post Master at New York that upwards of
      thirty Tons of Gunpowder were arrived at Philadelphia sent thither by the french Governor of
      <name>S. Domingo</name>. If private Men for the sake of Profit had been engaged in such a business, it
      would not have caused the same sensation here but it must easily occur to <name>Monsr <name>de Vergennes</name></name>
      that when a french Governor acts in that manner, it cannot but convey very different Ideas,
      and therefore The King makes full reliance that the Court of £ranee without delay will cause
      the necessary Inquiries to be made about it, and renew such Orders as there is reason to
      expect in consequence of their repeated friendly Declarations. </P>

      long ago, I mentioned that the world in general expected something essential to be done both
      by the fleet and army, and General Gage's return to England has made my resistance to your
      being recalled utterly ineffectual: the torrent has been too strong for me to be able to
      withstand it.</P>
   <P>You may however be assured that I shall in every place, both public and private, do you the
      justice you deserve, and declare my opinion that it has been more owing to accident than to
      misconduct that the operations of the fleet during this summer have not carried that
      importance with them that the nation expected. I am [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Lord Sandwich-I have just received your letter enclosing Rear-Admiral Byron's, who declines on
      account of his health serving as second in command in North America: he is too gallant an
      officer to pretend illness without sufficient reason; therefore I expect, when you see him,
      that he will not change his opinion; in which case I am clear that Sir <name>Peter Parker</name> is the
      properest person you can pitch upon. </P>
   <P>1. Barnes and Owen, eds., Sandwich Papers, I, 74-75. On September 14, Rear Admiral Byron wrote
      to Lord Sandwich declining the appointment as second in command in North America in these
      words: &quot;I hope your Lordship is convinced that as I never yet declined any service, so I
      should embrace this offered me now with infinite satisfaction did my health permit; but in its
      present impaired state, I am much afraid I should not prove equal to the task. I shall do
      myself the honour of waiting upon your Lordship as soon as you return to town.&quot; Ibid. </P>

   <P>I received yesterday the honour of Your Lordship's Letter of the 15th Inst No. 19, and in
      consequence I did not fail to speak to M: <name>de Vergennes</name> on the affair of the Powder sent to
      Philadelphia from St. Domingo. He assured me, <name>My Lord</name>, that we must certainly have been
      misinformed, and I must do him the Justice to say that the whole tenor of his Language which
      was frank and positive upon this occasion, convinces me that there is no Succour given to the
      American rebels by this nation with the countenance of Government: I did not mention to him
      from whom we had received this Information. </P>
   <P>In regard to the Opinion that the Rebels were assisted from hence, he observed, that it was
      impossible any military stores could be shipped from any of the Ports here without an order,
      as Powder and Ball were not considered as objects of Commerce, and as to the 30 Tuns of
      Gunpowder from St. Domingo, he assured me it must be a mistake; as the Governor of that
      Island, had to his knowledge refused the proposals which had been made to him on that Subject
      by some of our Colonies, - that he, as well as the other Commandants in their different
      possessions in that part of the World, had received the most positive orders not to give any
      assistance whatever to the Rebels; but however that he would not fail to speak to M: de
      Sartine to have them renewed, and to make particular enquiries about this Envoy to
      Philadelphia, to which, he repeated, that for the reasons abovementioned he could give no sort
      of Credit. </P>

   <P>The King having judged it expedient to direct that there should be a change in the destination
      of the Five Regiments of Infantry, vizt 17th 27th 28th 46th &amp; 55th now under Orders for
      immediate embarkation from Corke; I have it in command from my Lords Commissioners of the
      Admiralty to signify their direction to you that, notwithstanding any former Orders, if all
      the Five Regiments shall be at Corke at the time you receive this, you order the Masters of
      the Transport Vessels in which the 27th Regiment shall embark, to proceed directly and land
      the said Regiment at Halifax; and that you proceed with the Transports. having the other Four
      Regiments to Quebec if it be possible to get up the River so as to land the Troops at that
      place; but if on your arrival off the River St. Lawrence you find it absolutely impracticable
      to proceed to Quebec, you are, in that case, to order the Masters of the Transports having the
      17th Regiment to proceed and land it at Halifax; and you are with the Transports having the
      other Three Regiments (after procuring what Intelligence you can at Halifax or by any other
      means whatever, where the Army under the Command of Generals Gage or Howe shall be) to proceed
      without loss of time to join it.</P>
   <P>If the 27th Regiment should be sailed from Corke before these Orders arrive there, you are
      then to direct the Masters of the Transports with the 46th Regiment to proceed from thence
      directly &amp; land the said Regiment at Halifax; and to proceed yourself with the Ships
      having the remaining Three Regiments to Quebec if possible.</P>
   <P>If three of the said Regiments should be sailed before you receive these Orders, then of the
      remaining two Regiments, That which has a Colonel or the Senior Lieut. Colonel (if no Colonel)
      being to embark for Halifax, you are to give Orders to the Masters of the Transports to
      proceed and land the said Regiment accordingly; and to proceed yourself with the Transports
      which are to carry the other Regiment to Quebec. I am &amp;c.</P>

   <P>[London] 22 September, 1775.</P>
   <P>I am afraid the most wicked machinations of Governor Dunmore have by this time involved you in
      the horrors of war. What the Ministry intend against you and the rest of America, cannot be
      exactly ascertained before the meeting of the Parliament. Probably they have not yet
      determined upon the exact mode of executing their vengeance. You will do wisely, however, in
      preparing for the utmost extremity that the most unprincipled and deepest revenge can suggest.
      It is said, and I believe with truth, that the war is to be carried into Virginia, as well as
      in the northern Provinces, next spring. This winter will be employ'd in providing every means
      that can shield you from the destruction to which your merciless enemies have destined you.
      Some precautions will be taken, relative to your Negroes. Some fortifications, in the places
      by nature most inaccessible, for Magazines and Refuge will be made. Cannot the Capes, by the
      co-operation of the two Colonies, be rendered impassable? Should not alarm Houses be erected
      there as well as the mouths of the Rivers? No precautions can be too great against the dangers
      that threaten you, especially as no one can tell what foreign foes, taking the advantage of
      the present state of things, may invade you.</P>
   <P>The utmost industry of the Ministry is employed to inflame men's minds here, especially by
      publishing General Gage's accusations of savageness and barbarity in carrying on the war on
      the part of the Provincials. These accusations, like those of [Francis] Bernard and [Thomas]
      Hutchinson, are made in such general terms, as admit not of a specific refutation, and in a
      general denial, his word is more like to gain credit than that of those he accuses.</P>
   <P>Whatever may be the real sentiments of People here in this question, it is not easy to
      conceive more quietism than prevails in general. The interested on each side declare
      themselves, but the bulk of the Nation is perfectly silent. We therefore see the Jacobites and
      Nonjurors addressing for coercive measures, the Merchants and Manufacturers petitioning for
      conciliation, while the Counties and large Cities in general (London excepted), remain unmovd.
      The increase of taxes, which another year's continuance of violent measures must produce, will
      excite much clamour, which will not be diminished by the interruption of Commerce.</P>
   <P>Our good friends at Glasgow, are by their Agents here endeavoring to procure a proposition
      from the Merchants, in conjunction with them, to supply Administration with Money for carrying
      on the war, provided the forfeited lands in America are secured to them. This money is what
      the Virginians chiefly have supplied them with, in contemplation of the approaching troubles,
      by treble Remittances. This is Scotch gratitude.</P>
   <P>Thirty thousand men, is said to be the Estimate of the whole force intended against America,
      next year; and indeed it is difficult to conceive, where troops and taxes will be found for
      such an Army. Wherever the storm falls it will be heavy. But that such a force can shake one
      Province, much less the whole Continent, is to me incredible. I am afraid a total disconnexion
      between the two Countries will be the consequence of these hostile measures. Common danger,
      however, if it should occur, would unite them again. The ensuing Session of Parliament, will
      decide whether we are to have actual War or not. For should opposition be stronger and in
      earnest, I cannot but think the calamities we dread will yet be prevented. However this is
      more to be hoped than trusted to. Parliament is to meet on the 26th of next month. If anything
      could make us doubt a providence it would be that the lust of Tyrants is suffered perpetually
      to blot the face of the earth with blood and misery. It seems that Liberty is never to be
      procured, or maintained, but by the Sword. Be vigilant in providing for your safety against
      the probable attempts of next Spring; and let not the Philistines come upon you unprepar'd.
      The union of America once secur'd, her vigilance must render all attempts upon her Liberties
      abortive. </P>
   <P>God bless and preserve You and Yours; and send us a happy issue out of these distresses and
      dangers. </P>

   <P>[Admiralty Office] 25th Septemr 1775.</P>
   <P>It being of very great importance that every possible Effort should be made to secure a
      passage to Quebec for such part of the Troops as you have been directed by my Letter of the
      21st Instant to proceed with to that Place; I have it in command from my Lords Commissioners
      of the Admiralty to suggest to you such Information as they have received respecting the
      practicability of effecting this Service.</P>
   <P>As the Season is far advanced it is to be suspected that the Transports will on the Entrance
      of the River <name>St Lawrence</name> meet with strong North West Winds, But you must not be discouraged by
      this circumstance, as the Ships may notwithstanding work up to the Island of Bic, or possibly
      to Hare Island, at both which places there is good and safe anchorage, and in the
      neighbourhood of which the Troops may be landed, and march by Land through a settled Country
      to Quebec, if the Transports cannot get higher up; in which case you must send an Express to
      General Carlton immediately upon your arrival at either of those Islands, requesting that he
      would send a proper Officer down to conduct the Troops, and also such Sloops, Schooners &amp;
      small Craft as can be procured to carry up the Baggage and Stores.</P>
   <P>The Knowledge of these Circumstances is so very material, and the information came from such
      respectable Authority, that it has been judged proper to send a Messenger on purpose with.
      this Dispatch arid a Dispatch of the like import from the Earl of Dartmouth to the Commander
      in Chief of the Troops under orders for Embarkation, in hopes that he willbe able to get to
      Corke before your Departure. I have only to add that their Lordships, having the firmest
      reliance on your zeal for His Majesty's Service, make no doubt of your exerting yourself to
      the utmost in the execution of this most important part of it and have consequently the
      greatest confidence in your success. I am &amp;c. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Having this moment learned from Mr Stephens that the <name>Magdalene Schooner</name> is not yet Sailed with
      my Dispatch of the 8th instant I think it my Duty to inclose Copies of two Dispatches to Major
      General Howe which will inform you off the further arrangement made in respect to the five
      Regiments now under orders of Embarkation at Corke -</P>
   <P>As there are onboard the Transports that take in those Regiments a great many necessary Stores
      for the Army under General Howe, it is very much to be Wished that if they get up to Quebec
      they may be ordered immediately after the Troops are landed, to proceed to Boston, or to
      wherever the Army under Major General Howe may be; But you may nevertheless take out such part
      of those Stores as you shall think may be wanted for the Troops under your Command I am Sir

   <Title>INTELLIGENCE FROM LONDON 1</Title>
   <P>[London] September 25.</P>
   <P>It is the fixed resolution of the Cabinet to carry on the war against America with the utmost
      vigour; and to begin the next campaign as early as possible in the spring. The outlines of the
      plan to be pursued, are, an army of eighteen thousand men to be employed in New-England, and
      another army of twelve thousand men are to act in Virginia and the middle Provinces. Two
      fleets are to co-operate with these armies; one commanded by Admiral Shuldham (vice Graves)
      and the other by Admiral Byron.</P>
   <P>It is not necessary to make many observations on this resolution, and this plan. The American
      towns will, of course, be destroyed; carnage, plunder, rapine, and murder, will be the
      constant spectacle every where; and when the coast, and the country, are laid waste by fire
      and sword, what is to become of our trade? And what is the honour, or the profit of this
      mighty conquest, if it can be achieved? Can the landed interest alone support the enormous
      expence of this ruinous war? And of what benefit are the Colonies, when they are desolated?
      But suppose, what is not quite improbable, that the armies are defeated, and the fleets are
      burned, will not the Colonies hereafter abhor us, for this attempt to destroy them? Either way
      the trade to America is lost. And Great-Britain, if not literally ruined by the separation and
      expence, will however be so essentially injured and impoverished, she cannot support herself
      as she has hitherto done. She will indeed exist, but it will be in a languishing state. Yet
      the Ministers, indifferent to every thing but their salaries, are incessantly flattering and
      cajoling the country gentlemen with a parcel of crude, idle, visionary tales and expectations,
      of an American revenue, in order to obtain their votes in Parliament; for they well know, that
      their date in office depends upon th_eir carrying on this American war.</P>
   <P>The African trade has felt the blow already. The West India trade staggers, and is doomed to
      fall the next. No trade can long stand the present unwise contest. The loss of the American
      commerce is a lasting evil; the substitute for it, in the flush which the Russian peace and
      the Spanish armament have caused, is contingent, casual, inadequate. </P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Your letter No 44 has been received and laid before the King.</P>
   <P>We are very much disposed to give Credit to the repeated Declarations of the French Ministers
      that their Government does not give Sanction to the Proceedings of Individuals in the Trade
      they carry on with the Rebels in America, but notwithstanding the Language <name>Monsr <name>de Vergennes</name></name>
      held to You in his Conversation on that Subject, it is not possible but he must know, if he
      ever makes the Inquiries he promises, that very considerable Quantities of Arms and Ammunition
      have been sent from France and the West India Islands to several of Our Colonies in America.
      These Practices will not be discontinued, unless the Intendants and other Officers in the
      French Ports and at their Islands, who have the Cognizance and Inspection of such Affairs, be
      not absolutely prohibited from conniving at those Embarkations, and do not receive Orders to
      prevent them. We know for certain the Particulars of several Cargoes loaded at Bayonne, St
      Malo, and particularly at Bordeaux, from whence a Ship was to sail about the beginning of this
      Month with 300 Casks of Gunpowder &amp; 5000 Musquets with Bayonets compleat, for account of
      Americans, and there is now at Paris a Philadelphia Merchant furnished with Money for
      purchasing Warlike Stores. As I am now on this Subject I cannot avoid mentioning another
      particular, which is, the Encouragement given to carrying Tobacco &amp; other American
      Products directly to France. Many Ships are arrived at Dunkirk, Bayonne, Bordeaux &amp;c with
      those Commodities directly from America. This is publickly known to be an illicit Trade at all
      times, and at this Juncture in particular is of great Prejudice to Great Britain, by the
      Advantage deriving thereby to the rebellious Colonies, &amp; by the facility it gives to their
      Ships of investing the Produce of their Cargoes in Arms &amp; Ammunition, purchased in France,
      for their return Voyages to America.</P>
   <P>These Circumstances are not only mentioned for Your own Information, but You are permitted to
      report them, as occasions offer, to <name>Monsr <name>de Vergennes</name></name>, that he may at least know that we are
      apprized of what passes, and if their Declarations have any meaning, it belongs to Them to
      apply the Remedy, without our making any formal Complaint, which is not the Intention to do at
      present. </P>
   <P>Count <name>de Guines</name> has not yet made any Application to me about the Conduct of any of Our Sea
      Officers, with Regard to French Ships. When he does, the most diligent Inquiry will be made
      thereupon, and I shall be enabled in due Time to give a proper Answer. I am &amp;c </P>

   <P>Undoubtedly you think as I do that we cannot prevent the Court in London from stopping trade
      with the English colonies, and that we can raise no objection on this subject. As for the
      American vessels which will be able to reach Dunkerque or another one of our ports, nothing
      should hinder their entry;but in my opinion it will be advisable to prevent them from taking
      on any sort of war material. </P>

   <P>AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHARLES BIDDLE 1</P>
   <P>[Lorient, October 3, 1775] 2</P>
   <P> . . . Off the Banks of Newfoundland we fell in with several sail, amongst them was a frigate
      that, about eight o'clock, gave chase to us; she was then near three leagues from us. There
      was a pleasant breeze, and she gained very little upon us until about ten o'clock, in a heavy
      squall we found she had gained considerably upon us, they having carried their topgallant
      sails when we were obliged to take in ours, and lower our topsails. Just after the squall a
      young man named <name>John Williams</name> fell from the foreyard overboard. He was a Bermudian, and swam
      like a fish. A rope was hove to him, which missing, he went astern. He was called to, not to
      be afraid, and answered he was not the least uneasy. We threw him a spar. [Captain John] Craig
      was of opinion the frigate would pick him up, and was against heaving to, but I had the brig
      hove to, the boat hoisted out, and we got him on board. we had no right to expect the frigate
      would heave to when we would not. It was a very trying time for me, for the frigate was coming
      up fast, and I did not know what would be the consequences of my being taken going on such an
      expedition. It may be supposed I was very impatient until we made sail. While the boat was
      out, Craig was comforting me by declaring he was sure our heaving to would occasion our being
      taken. However, there was no danger of Williams's being drowned, for he could swim to Bermuda.
      Before we could make sail the frigate was within less than two miles of us. It blew hard in
      squalls all t_he afternoon; in the squalls she gained upon us, but when we could carry our
      topgallant sails we dropped her. Finding she could not come up with us, just before it was
      dark she hove to and hoisted a signal of distress. As I supposed it only done to decoy us, we
      paid no regard to her signal; indeed it was pretty evident nothing material could be the
      matter, for she carried a press of sail the whole day, and left her convoy, or the ships in
      company with her, in the morning. Before I sailed we had an account of one of our ships being
      taken by bearing down upon an armed vessel that hoisted a signal of distress. Taking vessels
      by this infamous method should be forbidden by all nations, for, if made a practice, no one
      would run the hazard of being taken, let the appearance of distress be ever so evident, and
      thus many lives may be lost that if this shameful practice was put a stop to would be saved. I
      was much rejoiced to get clear of the frigate. Some time after in the night we fell in with a
      brig bound from Lisbon to Cork. The captain inquired eagerly what news? I told him the
      American army had the advantage of the British in several engagements, and expected soon to
      drive them from the country. He struck his speaking trumpet with great violence upon the
      roughtree and swore he was glad to hear it, and hoped we would soon drive the British from
      America. When we were near the coast we passed a great many vessels that from the badness of
      the weather would not run in with the land. The twenty-second day after we left the Capes we
      arrived at L'Orient. </P>
   <P>1. Biddle, ed., <name>Charles Biddle</name> Autobiography, 76, 77. </P>
   <P>2. The date is approximated. Biddle probably cleared the Delaware Capes on September 11. He
      could have arrived at Lorient October 3 (the &quot;twenty-second day&quot; thereafter). </P>

   <P>I have the honor of informing your Lordship That yesterday Morning Sir <name>Jno Blagmire</name> received a

      to your Lordship. </P>
   <P>I have this Moment seen a Captain of a Vessel from North Carolina in twenty one Days to Cork;
      he came in yesterday, &amp; reports that he saw <name>Fort Johns</name>[t]on burned by the Rebels; That
      when they began to rise there was an Officer and twenty Men of The King's Troops in the Fort,
      who with the Governor went on board the Man of War for Safety; That the Day before he sailed,
      a Messenger had arrived from the back-Settlers to acquaint the People on the Coast that They
      (the back-Inhabitants) would not submit to any Stoppage of their Trade, and that if their
      Ships were not suffered to proceed with the Produce of the Country, they would come down &amp;
      bum all the Houses on the Coast, and put the People to the Sword : That they could not live
      except they had a free-Trade &amp; would not obey any Orders to the contrary. He further
      reports that the back-Settlers had stopped all Kinds of Provisions from coming down the
      Country for the Supply of the People on the Coast, which had prevented Them from assembling in
      a Body to exercise &amp; train themselves as they had orders to do: I enquired if those
      backSettlers had any Disposition to the King's Service, he said not, but that they wished not
      to be under the Restrictions of their Trade, and were a People impatient of Rule as the
      others. </P>

   <P>The Chatham was unmoor'd yesterday with a Moderate Wind at WNWt and I expected you would have
      been informed of her being at Sea, but about three OClock it came round to the SWt in which
      Quarter it continues now blowing fresh and Captain Raynor was under a necessity of giving
      Orders to moor again. This detention gives me an Opportunity of representing to you the
      Careless and unfinished manner in which I found my Appartment, as well as those of the Captain
      and Officers of the Chatham, indeed mine so very unfit for an Officer of my Rank that I am
      sure there is not a Man on board her who is not furnished with a more Warm and comfortable
      Lodging; whether this is owing to the negligence of the Workmen, or those who overlook them,
      or to the false and ill judg'd Oeconomy, which prevails in our Dock Yards, is not my business
      to enquire, but I am confident, Sir, it is a matter of such importance that requires the
      interposition of their Lordships Authority to enquire into and correct in all His Majesty's
      Ships, but particularly in those destined on the laborious Service, and in the severe Climate
      where I am appointed to Command, lest their Lordships should suppose I have exaggerated in
      this representation I beg leave to refer them for confirmation of the truth of it, to
      Commissioner [James] Gambier and Sir <name>Peter Parker</name> who did me the honor to dine with me
      yesterday on board the Chatham. </P>
   <P>As the Season is now so far advanced that it is likely I shall meet very severe Weather on the
      Coast of America, I apprehend the Weight &amp; Inconvenience of the Flat bottom Boat now on
      board may be of very bad consequence, therefore should be glad to be disincumber'd of her, and

   <P>As Their Lordships have been pleased to appoint me to the important Command at North America,
      I must take the liberty of representing to you, that the Chatham is the worst and Oldest of
      any of the Fifty Gunships upon that Service, as well as extremely unfit and inconvenient for a
      Flag-Officer Commanding in Chief on a Service where his Ship is to be his constant residence,
      without the probability of lying a Night out of her during the course of his Command; I must
      therefore beg the favour you will signifie my request to Their Lordships, that they will
      please to Order, that the Vigilant at this Port may be fitted properly for me and sent out in
      the Spring; the difference of the Draught of Water is Trifling and the additional number of
      Men I am confident will never want constant and necessary Employment. The reason of my
      particularizing, and making choice of the Vigilant is, that she is the most Floaty Ship of her

   <P>[Nantes, October 10, 1775]</P>
   <P>I found there was no powder to be had here [Lorient], and therefore set off in a small French
      coaster for Nantes. The morning we went from L'Orient the skipper fell into the hold, and was
      so much hurt he thought it necessary to bear away and go into the river Vilaine, where his
      family lived. The crew all went from the vessel, and there was no one left on board but an old
      French seaman I brought from Philadelphia, and myself. As it was cold, I ordered him down in
      the cabin and to shut the scuttle. A short time after, perceiving a fire in the caboose which
      was in the hold, I told Peter to get up and put it out, but the hasp of he scuttle had got
      over the staple, and he could not get out, and there was no cabin window by which we could
      escape. In vain we tried every method to break or cut our way out. Fortunately the fire burnt
      down without doing any damage. It blew hard, and we remained in this perilous situation for
      twentyfour hours before the boat came on board and released us. As the wind was ahead, I went
      on shore. The people appeared to live very miserably, having little but black bread and fish
      to live upon. We remained here two or three days, when we sailed for Nantes, where we arrived
      the 10th of October in the evening. </P>

   <P>Having received three Letters from Philadelphia dated the 10th 19th &amp; 29th of July last,
      giving an Account of the Rebellious proceedings of His Majesty's Subjects there, I am

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>London, 13 October 1775</P>
   <P>No. 297</P>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>This week went by again and we have had no meeting with the Ministry. I have attempted,
      however, to enlighten myself positively on what had happened in America, since the papers have
      been filled for the past week with such circumstantial details concerning an action in Boston
      that it was difficult finally to think that they were unfounded as they appeared to be. It is
      however the exact truth, the Council has no information concerning this news and they do not
      believe it to be worthy of credence. </P>
   <P>I discussed this matter in great detail with the person to whom I went, who is attached to the
      Ministry and whose knowledge and friendship will be, I hope, most useful to me in these
      circumstances. Without doubt, the majority of the members of the Council reckon more than ever
      on a discord among the provinces of Northern America. The southern provinces are quite annoyed
      by the war and especially by the cessation of all trade. Paper money is a source of everyday
      grumble in public opinion; one must resort to force to bring it into circulation. This
      important point may become the rock that will thwart all the efforts of the Congress and cause
      its dissolution: there is even a letter from New York which asserts that this province refuses
      to pay forty thousand pound sterling levied by the Congress. </P>
   <P>The Ministry has been flattering itself in this manner for more than a year, and convinced
      that the Americans would fear war, it placed itself in a position where it had to start the
      war without really having the means to wage it with success; but the time has come now when
      the matter must be settled. The Ministry will come out unscathed in this Parliamentary
      session, but it should fear the next one. Either conciliation or force must end this American
      affair in 1776, or else great events will take place in this country which can be abused for
      awhile, but where an understanding attitude can then be replaced by one all the more terrible
      for those who owe Great Britain an account for their behavior.</P>
   <P>All private opinions always confirm a negotiation with Russia; you hold, <name>Monsieur le Comte</name>,
      the same view. We differ only on the outcome; I have forwarded the information to you such as
      it had been given to me; it was my duty to do so in circumstances of this importance; I saw
      all the dangers, but they would not have warranted my silence. Furthermore, the principle of
      the thing is essential here, since an alliance with Russia would bring terror to America,
      raise the stock of the Ministry here, and give England the opportunity, the means and per haps
      the desire to become less peaceful than it had been heretofore necessary as circumstances had
      isolated her.</P>
   <P><name>Myld North</name> summoned to his home one of the presidents of the board of the India Company and
      asked him how many recruits the Company intended to send there this year. The president
      answered two to three thousand. The Minister told him that he had asked him to stop at his
      home for this reason, that he had no orders to give to the Company, but that he wished, in the
      name of the King and in his own na,me, to point out to him that the levy of recruits for the
      East Indies would prevent one for the service of the King, in view of the fact that His
      British Majesty had great need of his troops in order to carry with vigor the next campaign
      against the Americans.</P>
   <P>Another project of more considerable importance is about to be carried out: it concerns an
      establishment on the Mosquito Coast 2 on the continent of Southern America. The plan of the
      Ministry is to acquire land from the chief of the inhabitants of this region and to sell or
      lease it to those who will agree to settle there; thirty or forty thousand settlers are
      expected to be attracted there. This project may be surprising at first, but its execution
      will seem more practicable once you consider the collateral aspects.</P>
   <P>The land could not be more fertile; it produces sugar comparable in quality to that produced
      in the islands of the west indies, as well as indigo, cotton, etc. It is rich in food plants
      of all kinds; European food plants adjust excellently; the animals brought there, multiply
      amazingly; the wood found there, known as Campeche wood, also called Mahogany in England, is a
      source of valuable trade. The King's son of that country and two other Indian chiefs have been
      in London for some time and have lodgings at the home of the person who conceived the plan for
      this establishment. He is a man with great talent, much genius; extensive knowledge and who
      seems to have a turn for conceiving great undertakings and carrying them out.</P>
   <P> . . . it would open a new and most interesting branch of trade and that, especially at the
      present time,-it would make the separation of England from her colonies less detrimental. He
      insisted most strongly on the political point in view of the location of this establishment;
      it can in time becom,e the key to the Spanish possessions occupying a central position among
      them. One can imagine the consequences for this power having the English in such force on that
      part of the continent; at present, the latter only have a few outposts there for the
      protection of the governor of Jamaica, which have already inflicted much loss to the Spanish
      trade. </P>
   <P>I enclose a petition from the city of Bristol presented the day before yesterday at the levee
      of the King of England by Mr. Burke, one of the best supporters of the opposition. It is
      opposite all the preceding petitions; it rejects means of force; it asserts that only a good
      conciliation offers a true solution. The Ministry agrees on this point; but where are these
      possible means of conciliation? </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Whitehall 16th Octr 1775. -</P>
   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Mr Burrow arrived at Lord Dartmouths Office on the 13th Inst and your dispatches were
      immediately laid before The King. - </P>
   <P>As soon as it was seen that the New England provinces meditated open Rebellion and Revolt, the
      Security of <name>Nova Scotia</name> became an Object of The King's care and solicitude; directions have
      been repeatedly given to the Commander in Chief to attend to it, and the inclosed Extracts of
      Lord Dartmouth's Dispatches will shew you that it has been urged in terms that marked out the
      Ideas that were entertained of it's Importance -</P>
   <P>You will readily believe that His Majesty's apprehensions for the Safety of Halifax were not a
      little increased by the Intelligence We received of the people of Machias having with Impunity
      destroyed one of The King's Ships and made prize of another, and having without Interruption
      fitted out Armed Vessels to cruize in.the Bay of Fundy. - It was therefore thought adviseable
      that one of the five Regiments destined to sail from Ireland for No America in the Month of
      September should proceed directly to Halifax, and the Transports with that Regt on board
      accordingly left Corke on the 27th Ulto Two other Regiments part of that Embarkation are under
      Order to proceed to Quebec, but if that cannot be Effected, which is likely be the Case, they
      will put into Halifax before they proceed to join the Army under General Howe, and the Roebuck
      a 40 Gun Ship which has been Sail'd more than three weeks for Halifax will be a considerable
      Augmentation of your Naval force. - </P>
   <P>The Advices however contained in your Dispatches and the Intelligence Mr Burrow brings that
      the Rebels from Machias had made Descents both at <name>St Johns</name> and Annapolis, are very alarming
      Circumstances and there is but too much reason to fear that some Attempts may have been made
      upon Halifax before you could receive any Succour either from home or from General Gage,
      unless the sending the Tartar into the Bay of Fundy, which was a very proper and well timed
      measure, should have discouraged those Invaders from proceeding any further least their
      Retreat should be cut off. -</P>
   <P>The ruinous State of the Fortifications at Halifax has been the Subject of frequent
      Consideration, but as the ablest Engineers who have been consulted upon it have concurred in
      opinion that the Harbour is too extensive and the Advantages of Attack too many to admit of
      any regular effectual Plan, all Ideas of that Kind have been laid aside. -</P>
   <P>It is judged proper however upon the present Occasion to direct that some Works upon a
      temporary plan of defence should be constructed for the Security of the King's Naval Yard and
      the Board of Ordnance will by this Conveyance send out Orders to that Effect to the principal
      Engineer at Halifax or if there be none there, an Engineer will take his passage in the
      Packet. which is specially appointed to convey this Letter. I am [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>London, 20 October 1775</P>
   <P>No. 298 </P>
   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>I brought up again the Newfoundland affair yesterday. All the Ministers are here and there is
      no reason to postpone it anymore. I intend to speak of this matter every day to Mylord
      Rochford, and you will assist me most effectually if you will do the same with Mylord
      Stormont; the great policy of the British Ministers is to gain time. </P>
   <P>The affair seems clear to me, and <name>Mylord Rochford</name> himself agrees. If there is to be no
      competition, English fishermen have no right to be established between Bonavista and <name>St. John</name>.
      If competition is the rule, it excludes by its own right sedentary establishments that wo~ld
      make it unreal; in both cases, it is a point in our favor. We have another undisputable one
      atising from the orders which the King of England gave in 1764 and 1770 to destroy these
      establishments following the memoranda delivered by the French Ambassadors to this Court.
      These orders which have proved to be without effect after eleven years can no longer be
      offered as a satisfaction to our grievances. Mylord Rocheford, however, repeatedly made such a
      proposal yesterday, on his own, he said, without authorization, as if it were a new idea that
      had just entered his mind. I answered that this was all we wished; if the effective date could
      be determined at the earliest time so that our next fishing operation could become a reality,
      which the King 2 would have no other way. We must give the impression to require this in order
      to make the exchange necessary, in as much as it is the only means of conciliation, and so
      that we turn the affair more surely to our advantage. </P>
   <P>As for the competition, <name>Mylcird Rochford</name> told me several times yesterday that it was absurd;
      that this mixture of English and French fishermen would be an eternal source of difficulties;
      and as he seemed to fear such difficulties, I innocently suggested to him that we send
      warships to police our fishermen as England does it with her own. As I expected, this idea
      made him shudder, and I do not despair that we can use it again, perhaps effectively, to make
      him finally sick of competition. </P>
   <P>I had to prolong my conference with this Minister because of the subject of Newfoundland; I
      left it to the Prince of Masseran [Maserand] to talk to him of the American affairs, and to
      probe his ulterior plans, as we have continually and carefully been doing. The Minister gave
      yesterday morning the order to send four more Infantry Regiments to Boston. The militia will
      receive orders, and the plan to have at least 40 thousand men available in America next summer
      appears certain. The Prince of Masseran made a few remarks upon the difficulty and the
      necessity to resort to foreign troops, in an effort to prevent it; he immediately mentioned
      the Russians. <name>Mylord Rochford</name> replied that they would take them wherever they could get them,
      and referred only to the men from Brunswick and Hesse. Here is something, Sir, of which I was
      warned yesterday by someone who has been of useful service to us for several years and whose
      information always proved to be correct. Day before yesterday, Lord North sent for Mr. Franks,
      a wealthy Jew and an esteemed merchant. He struck a bargain with him to supply rations between
      now and July next to the troops in America as follows:</P>
   <P>19 thousand Englishmen </P>
   <P>12 thousand Canadians</P>
   <P>.15 thousand Russians</P>
   <P>Total: 46 thousand men.</P>
   <P>This contract is very expensive and will cost fifty per cent more than if they could procure
      these supplies in America, since it is necessary to send them from Europe. Mr. Franks himself
      confided this fact in the person from whom I have it and asked that it be kept secret because
      Mylord North had expressly requested it: This Minister even added that he especially did not
      want revealed the num ber of Russians who were going to be in the pay of Great Britain. Mr.
      Franks is particularly esteemed by Their Britannic Majesties.</P>
   <P>I would answer, Sir, for the loyalty of the person who gave methese details as I would for
      myself. I do not doubt that he received them from Mr. Franks. However, why speak of the
      Russians if it is to be a mystery; and why would M ylord North have struck such a large
      bargain to such an important purpose a week before the return of Parliament which has not
      given him its consent? As to the first objection, it is indeed possible that this Minister
      found it safer to present the accomplished fact and have all the preparations for the war in
      America decided upon, rather than having them exposed to the delays and even the uncertainties
      of the decisions of Parliament. The ratification will be just as easy to obtain and it will
      not involve detrimental delays.</P>
   <P>The Ministry expects long debates on the opening day. They hope that Lord Chatham will not be
      able to be there. That day will be especially interesting as the topic of the address by the
      King of England will be restricted to the American affairs, and the Ministry will present
      immediately afterwards the facts, the available means, and its own views. </P>

      COLONIES 1</P>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>[Whitehall, October 22, 1775]</P>
   <P>Mr <name>Martin Govr</name> of North Carolina, in his Dispatches to the Earl of Dartmouth dated in July
      1775, &amp; which were received on the 10th of Septr makes a full representation of the State
      of that Province, and it appearing that notwithstanding he had been reduced to the humiHating
      necessity of taking refuge on board His Majesty's Sloop Cruizer in Cape Fear River, &amp; of
      submitting to the disgrace of seeing the King's Fort burnt by the rebels, yet he continued to
      be of opinion, that if he was supported with a small Force, and a supply of Arms &amp; some
      Field Pieces, he could raise a Body of Men in that Colony sufficient to reduce the rebellious
      Subjects both there, and in South Carolina, to obedience, &amp; to awe the Colony of Virginia,
      &amp; prevent any Auxiliaries being sent from thence to the Northward. He further says that.
      Addresses, in support of Govt had been sent to him from the back Settlements, &amp; that these
      Addresses had been signed by 14 or 1500 Men. </P>
   <P>In consequence of these Dispatches the Earl of Dartmouth on the 2d Septr 2 signified The
      King's Commands to the Master General of the Ordnance, that he should send to the Commander in
      Chief in No America, 10,000 stand of Arms &amp; 6 light Field Pieces, together with 200 rounds
      of Powder &amp; Ball for each Musket &amp; field Piece in order to enable him to afford such
      aid &amp; assistance to the Governor of <name>No Carolina</name>, as the situation and circumstances of
      that Province, might from time to time, require; And the Mastr General of the Ordnance was at
      the same time informed, that one of His Majesty's Ships of War would be ordered to take under
      her convoy such Storeship as the Board of Ordnance should provide for the conveyance of the
      Arms &amp; Artillery abovementioned. </P>
   <P>On the 15th Septr Lord Dartmouth acquainted Major <name>Genl Howe</name> by letter, with the substance of
      the Advices which had been received from <name>Govr Martin</name> &amp; with the orders which had been
      given respecting the Arms and Artillery which were to be sent to him; and at the same time
      signified to him, His Majesty's Pleasure, that if he should find, when the letter reached him,
      that there was good ground to suppose that the sending to <name>No Carolina</name> a Detachment of his Army
      under an able &amp; intelligent Officer, would have the good effect Mr Martin seemed to expect
      from it, &amp; His Majesty's Service would, in other respects, admit of it, he should in that
      case, send such Detachment accordingly, consisting of, at least, one Battalion, together with
      the Arms &amp; Field Pieces above mentioned. </P>
   <P>On the 23d Septr a letter was recd at Ld Dartmouth's Office from Lord Wm Campbell the Govr of
      South Carolina, containing a very full representation of the State of that Province, from
      which it appeared that a very considerable part of the People suffering under the tyranny
      &amp; oppression of the traiterous Acts of the Congresses &amp; Committees, had shewn a
      disposition to resist them, &amp; to support legal Governt &amp; therefore as this was a
      circumstance deserving attention, in any plan which the Commander in chief might have in view,
      in consequence of Lord Dartmouth's letter of the 15th Sepr for employing a part of his force
      during the open part of the Winter in an Expedition to the Southward, it was judged proper to
      transmit this intelligence to him in a Dispatch dated 25th of Septr. </P>
   <P>These Advices recd from the Govrs of <name>No Carolina</name> &amp; So Carolina were in great measure
      confirmed by other intelligence received thro' variety of channels. Persons of property &amp;
      interest in the Southern Colonies complained that the friends of Govt there, were neglected;
      &amp; Lord Dunmore, in a Dispatch recd much about the same time, made himself responsible for
      securing the obedience of Virginia, with the assistance of a small Force.</P>
   <P>Upon a view of all these Circumstances, it was resolved early in Octr to take up the
      consideration of an Expedition to the Southern Colonies upon a more extensive plan; &amp; His
      Majesty's Pleasure was signified that 5 Regiments of Infantry, Vizt the 15th 37th 53d 54th
      &amp; 57th and also 2 Companies of Artillery, taking with them 10 Battalion Guns, &amp; as
      many Howitzers &amp; Ammusettes as the number of Artillery Men could serve, should hold
      themselves in readiness to embark on or before the 1st of December. </P>
   <P>On the 22d of Octr Lord Dartmouth acquainted Major General Howe with the grounds &amp; reasons
      upon which this plan was adopted, &amp; with the orders that had been given, for the several
      Corps to hold themselves in readiness. His Lordship further acquainted the General, that the
      whole would be ordered to proceed under convoy of a proper Naval Force to Cape Fear River,
      where there was good reason to expect, from the representations made by <name>Govr Martin</name>, they
      would be joined by a large Body of Highland Emigrants. The General was also told that it was
      The King's Intention that this Body of Troops should, upon their arrival, be under the Command
      of one of the General Officers then with him, &amp; that one of them should proceed
      immediately upon the arrival of that Dispatch in a ship of War to Cape Fear River, &amp; to
      remain on board either within the River, or in the Offing, as should be judged most proper,
      until the arrival of the Forces from Corke, before which time it was observed, he would
      probably have been able to collect such information &amp; materials as might enable him the
      better to judge of the plan of operations to be pursued - And as there was reason to believe
      that the Navigation of that part of the Coast of North America was both dangerous &amp;
      difficult, the having 2 or 3 small Vessels furnished with able Pilots to cruize off the Coast
      for the arrival of the Fleet was mentioned to him as a circumstance deserving his attention. </P>
   <P>It was further observed in that Dispatch that the representations made by <name>Govr Martin</name>, of the
      great probability there was, that any body of Troops sent to <name>No Carolina</name> would, upon their
      arrival, be joined, by a considerable number of Highland Emigrants, &amp; by the well-affected
      Inhabitants of 4 or 5 Counties, were the reasons which had principally induced The King's
      Servants to advise the Armaments proceeding in the first place to Cape Fear River in North
      Carolina, but that at the same time it was not His Majesty's Intentions that the Genl should
      in his plan of operations, be confined to any particular Province, &amp; that his choice, in
      that respect, must be governed by his own judgment, after maturely weighing every circumstance
      of greater or less advantage &amp; facility, in the means of restoring the public tranquillity
      &amp; reestablishing the authority of The King's Govt which object being once effected in any
      one of the Southern Colonies, the Troops might proceed to another, leaving the support &amp;
      protection of that which had been so reduced to a Corps formed out of the well~affected
      Provincials who should have taken up Arms in The King's Cause. </P>
   <P>With regard to the steps which it might be proper for the General to take in case he should
      possess himself either of the Capital of any of the Southern Provinces, or of any other Town
      in which the Civil Govr might exercise the functions of his Office with safety, it was
      suggested that it would be proper; in that case to require that all Committees of Towns or
      Congresses' of such Committees, as well as other unlawful associations which had been forined,
      should be dissolved. That the Courts of Justice should be opened. That all persons whatsoever
      should take the oaths of allegiance before the Judges of such Courts, &amp; that those who
      had, by the instigation of the Committees, taken up Arms against lawful Authority, should
      surrender the same, &amp; make such declaration of their future obedience as the Govr should,
      by the advice of the Council, direct &amp; require. But that if the Inhabitants of the
      Province, or any part of them, should refuse to comply with these requisitions, it would be
      the duty of The King's General, to employ the Troops under his Command, to force them to
      obedience, by seizing the persons &amp; effects of the Delinquents, &amp; by proceeding
      against any Towns in which the People should assemble in Arms, hold meetings of Committees or
      Congresses or prevent The King's Courts of Justice from assembling. </P>
   <P>It was further observed that the sending so considerable a body of Troops, was a Measure
      adopted principally upon the encouragement held out by the King's Governors, that if such a
      respectable force was sent as might make it safe for the friends of Govt to shew themselves,
      they would soon prevail over those, who having found means to get the sword into their hands,
      had been able to effect their rebellious purposes without control, &amp; therefore at the same
      time that the Rebels were to be encouraged to hope for mercy upon submission, it would be
      proper that every species of reward should be offered to. those who should consent to list
      under the Royal Banner, &amp; who, besides an allowance of the same pay as the King's Troops
      rec'd so long as they continued in service, should be encouraged to expect a remission of all
      arrears of Quit rent due to the Crown. &amp; an exemption from the payment of any, for a few
      years to come.</P>

      Admiral Graves or the Commander in Chief for the time being of His Majesty's Ships and Vessels
      in North America, directed him to give the most positive orders to the Captains of the several
      Ships under his Command to burn and destroy every armed Vessel that shall appear to be fitted
      out by the Inhabitants of the Colonies in general which are associated in arms against the
      King; I am commanded by their Lordships to send you herewith a Copy of the said order for your

   <P>Dear Sir-I take the chance of catching you at Plymouth to apprise you that five regiments from
      Ireland are ordered to embark without delay; and as the transports are already engaged, will
      probably sail the beginning of December. Their destination is to North Carolina, in order to
      take possession of that province and to make a powerful diversion by that means to the attacks
      of the rebels in the north. As Sir <name>Peter Parker</name> will be ready for the sea in about a month, he
      will have the conduct of this expedition; and as we understand that the 28-gun ships are
      rather too large to get up the river, we shall muster all the small 20-gun ships that can be
      got ready in time and appropriate them to this service; but we have no sloops to spare, so
      that if you think after your arrival at Boston that you can spare any small craft that will be
      of use in this business, you would do well to send them to await the arrival of Sir Peter
      Parker with the transports. And if you can with privacy procure any pilots for that coast, it
      might be of material service; but you must be upon your guard about keeping this matter an
      impenetrable secret, unless you should find it necessary to communicate it to General Howe or
      the commander-in-chief of the army in America. I am [etc.] </P>

   <P>London, 24 October 1775</P>
   <P>No. 300</P>
   <P>I had the honor, Sir, to write you a private letter concerning the news that arrived from
      Canada and I took advantage of the immediate departure of a reliable person. I received more
      information in the course of the evening, according to which I consider Canada as lost for
      this country, because it is already an accomplished fact, or, which is the same, because it
      cannot be prevented. These Americans are a hundred times better soldiers and politicians than
      the English, and it is not surprising that they finally tired of considering the latter as
      such; the conquest of Canada will decide the freedom of America. Once the Rebels are in
      control of Quebec, Montreal and the St. Lawrence river, and join forces with the Canadians,
      their rearwill be protected and America will be independent: The preliminary step of this
      great operation was the capture of Ticonderoga; but before breaking out they waited until
      communications between England and Canada would stop for six months and give them all the
      tirrie needed to complete this great work. The Congress of Philadelphia, neither divided nor.
      corrupted, is more capable of great undertaakings than the English parliament.</P>
   <P>The capture of Halifax is not as certain as the conquest of Canada, however, according to the
      information I have, I feel it deserves credence to some degree.</P>
   <P>I have just received notice that the Ministry has sent an order to all ports to the effect
      that no ship whatever be allowed to sail. I shall be certain that this fact is correct only
      when I receive confirmation from the ports themselves. At all events, the courier who carriers
      this dispatch will surely go through because I am giving him the order, should he meet with
      any obstacle, to charter a packet-boat for himself, and that could not be refused to him. </P>

   <P>THE KING'S, SPEECH OPENING THE SESSION OF PARLIAMENT 1</P>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>[October 26, 1775]</P>
   <P>My Lords, and Gentlemen; </P>
   <P>The present situation of America, and my constant desire to have your advice, concurrence, and
      assistance on every important occasion, have determined me to call you thus early
      together.</P>
   <P>Those who have long too successfully laboured to inflame my people in America, by gross
      misrepresentations, and to infuse into their minds a system of opinions repugnant to the true
      constitution of the colonies, and to their subordinate relation to Great Britain, now openly
      avow their revolt, hostility, and rebellion. They have raised troops, and are collecting a
      naval force; they have seized the public revenue, and assume to themselves legislative,
      executive, and judicial powers, which they already exercise in the most arbitrary manner over
      the persons and properties of their fellow subjects. And although many of these unhappy people
      may still retain their loyalty, and may be too wise not to see the fatal consequence of this
      usurpation, and wish to resist it, yet the torrent of violence has been strong enough to
      compel their acquiescence till a sufficient force shall appear to support them. </P>
   <P>The authors and promoters of this desperate conspiracy have, in the conduct of it, derived
      great advantage from the difference of our intention and theirs. They meant only to amuse, by
      vague expressions of attachment to the parent state, and the strongest protestations of
      loyalty to me, whilst they were preparing for a general revolt. On our part, though it was
      declared in your last session that a rebellion existed within the province of the
      Massachuset's Bay, yet even that province we wished rather to reclaim than to subdue. The
      resolutions of parliament breathed a spirit of moderation and forbearance; conciliatory
      propositions accompanied the measures taken to enforce authority, and the coercive acts were
      adapted to cases of criminal combinations amongst subjects not then in arms. have acted with
      the same temper, anxious to prevent, if it had been possible, the effusion of the blood of my
      subjects, and the calamities which are inseparable from a state of war; still hoping that my
      people in America wouid have discerned the traitorous views of their leaders, and have been
      convinced, that to be a subject of Great Britain, with aff its consequences, is to be the
      freest member of any civil society in the known world. </P>
   <P>The rebellious war now levied is become more general, and is manifestly carried on for the
      purpose of establishing an independent empire. I need not dwell upon the fatal effects of the
      success of such a plan. The object is too important, the spirit of the British nation too
      high, the resources with which God hath blessed her too numerous, to give up so many colonies
      which she has planted with great industry, nursed with great tenderness, encouraged with many
      commercial advantages, and protected and defended at much expence of blood and treasure.</P>
   <P>It is now become the part of wisdom and (in its effects) of clemency, to put a speedy end to
      these disorders by the most decisive exertions. For this purpose I have increased my naval
      establishment, and greatly augmented my land forces; but in such a manner as may be the least
      burthensome to my kingdoms.</P>
   <P>I have also the satisfaction to inform you, that I have received the most friendly offers of
      foreign assistance; and if I shall make any treaties in consequence thereof, they shall be
      laid before you. And I have, in testimony of my affection for my people, who can have no cause
      in which I am not equally interested, sent to the garrisons of Gilbraltar and <name>Port Mahon</name>, a
      part of my electoral troops, in order that a larger number of the established forces of this
      kingdom may be applied to the maintenance of its authority; and the national militia, planned
      and regulated with equal regard to the rights, safety, and protection of my crown and people,
      may give a farther extent and. activity to our military operations.</P>
   <P>When the unhappy and deluded multitude, against whom this force will be directed, shall become
      sensible of their error, I shall be ready to receive the misled with tenderness and mercy: and
      in order to prevent the inconveniences which may arise from the great distance of their
      situation, and to remove, as soon as possible, the calamities which they suffer, I shall give
      authority to certain persons upon the spot to grant general or particular pardons and
      indemnities, in such manner, and to such persons as they shall think fit; and to receive the
      submission of any province or colony, which shall be disposed to return to its allegiance. It
      may be also proper to authorize the persons so commissioned to restore such province or colony
      so returning to its allegiance, to the free exercise of its trade and com merce, and to the
      same protection and security, as if such province or colony had never revolted.</P>

   <Title>AN AccouNT OF LORD SANDWICH'S REMARKS IN THE HousE OF LoRDS 1</Title>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>[October 26, 1775]</P>
   <P>In answer to some strictures made by the noble duke 2 who spoke last, he defended the conduct
      of the naval officer who commanded on the American station, and seemed to hint some degree of
      censure upon the operations on shore. He confessed, that things were much altered, and that it
      was necessary to considerably augment our navy; that he had already taken every precaution in
      his power; that the armament of last year had consisted of thirty armed vessels of different
      sizes, two of them two decked vessels; that twenty were actually sailed, or were ready to sail
      to reinforce them; and that it was the intention of administration to complete the number, by
      the time that operations were to commence, to seventy vessels, which would be such aforce
      cooperating with the army, as would render it impossible for the Americans either to resist,
      keep together, or subsist; as they would have at once all the calamities of a war to contend
      with, without the means of carrying it on; being thus cut off from all supplies they might
      expect to derive from Europe, or eslewhere. His lordship confessed, that administration had
      been deceived in some measure; yet he thought it necessary now to declare, that it was his own
      private opinion, that the stronger the navy was, the more effectual their operations would be.
      He saw the matter very evidently in that light; but it was generally believed, if a larger
      force had been demanded, it would have raised an opposition to the measures at large; and this
      was one very powerful motive for his not explaining his own ideas so fully as otherwise he was
      most certainly disposed to do. </P>

   <Title>REMARKS OF DR. JoHN HINCHCLIFFE IN THE HousE OF LoRds 1 </Title>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>[October 26, 1775]</P>
   <P>We were assured last year, that upon the appearance of a re-inforcement which could protect
      them from the insults of the mob, a considerable party would declare themselves in favour of
      the mother country: that there is no reason now to flatter ourselves with such an expectation
      is too obvious to be insisted upon. It was said too, in the spring, that the Americans would
      not, some indeed were confidently persuaded they could not, fight; yet we now certainly know
      that they can and will fight, for they have fought. It is true, they were defeated, but
      considering the stand they made, and the intrepidity of the troops they had to contend with,
      they were not disgraced by their defeat. We were made to believe, a year ago, that the
      restraints put upon the commerce and fisheries of the colonies would press so hard upon their
      interests, as to bring them to submission. We have now learnt that their commerce is but a
      secondary consideration: if it may not be called liberty itself, that they are contending for,
      it is at least the opinion of liberty, which operates no less forcibly on the passions of
      mankind.</P>

   <Title>REMARKS OF GEORGE JoHNSTONE IN THE HousE OF COMMONS 1</Title>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>[October 26, 1775]</P>
   <P> . . . What my worthy friend (Mr. Burke) said last year of their industry, may now be applied
      to their warlike achievements. Consider the power of such materials in the hands of a minister
      who knew how to encourage their industry, and apply their courage to the purposes of national
      defence: but all the secret of our colony government is now reduced to mere force, the baneful
      engine of destructive depotism; nevertheless it is with pleasure I perceive the force of this
      country, when wielded in such a cause, is totally inadequate; your own army is not sufficient;
      your illegal application for foreign mercenaries at the beginning of the contest, sufficiently
      shews your weakness; your navy is equally incapable of effecting the purposes which are
      expected from it. It may ruin their foreign trade; it may destroy some of their towns (though
      that is doubtful) but the lying in their rivers, as some suppose, without a superior military
      force to protect them on shore; I say as a sea officer, if the war is thoroughly kindled, the
      thing-is impossible. We are apt to judge from what happened at Quebec; where the French, never
      remarkable for naval enterprize, though naturally brave, quitted their fire raft, and left it
      to the chance of the stream, or to be towed off by boats; but this I maintain, that any fleet
      lying in a river where - they cannot command the shore, that such fleet is liable to be burnt
      if the people are willing in that enterprize to run the same risk of life and danger to which
      the crew of the ships are exposed, I mean by sticking by the fire vessel, whatever she may be,
      till with wind and stream they lay the enemy athwart hause; and who can doubt that the people
      in America are capable of such exertions of courage when we see them refuse quarter, when we
      find them devoting themselves to death with such enthusiasm? Another circumstance respecting
      ships is not generally known. The wonders they have hitherto performed has been owing to the
      ignorance of engineers in placing their batteries; but I am afraid the secret is now out as to
      their power against. the shore, without a military force to assist them; a single gun in a
      retired situation, or on an eminence, or a single howitzer, will dislodge a first rate man of
      war, and may burn her, to add to the disgrace. I speak this publicly, that you may not expect
      more from the sea service than it is capable to perform. Ruin their trade you certainly may,
      but at an expence as ruinous to this country. Has any of the ministry considered the immense
      expence of such naval armaments on the coast of America, in transports and ships of war? Have
      we calculated the chance of destruction by those horrid streams of wind peculiar to that
      coast, that sometimes sweep all before them? Where are the resources on which this country can
      depend in case our empire in America is lost? I do not say you will feel the disadvantage
      immediately, I know the various channels to which commerce and industry may divert their
      streams; I am also certain that the wants of America must be supplied in some way or other
      with certain goods from Great Britain; I further know, that a nation can only trade to the
      extent of its capital, and in case one vent is cut off, it will probably find another, while
      its manufactures are cheaper and better than those of other nations. I believe such to be the
      case with many branches of our manufacture at present, but is it possible it can long
      continue? Must not the same laws of nature follow this commercial country that has affected
      Venice and Genoa, the Hans Towns, and other commercial states? The acquirement of wealth must
      produce dearness in living; dearness of living must produce dearness of labour; dearness of
      labour must produce dearness of manufactures; dearness of manufactures must conduct trade to
      some place where cheapness of living will give the preference in the markets. Thus the circle
      of commerce has hitherto run: but the settlement of North America under the old establishment,
      seemed to defy the powers of those fleeting principles. America was bound to take your
      manufactures only to whatever price they might rise; you were bound to take most of her raw
      materials and to give her commerce protection; a complete system in the exchange of all
      commodities was established within your own dominion, which might last beyond the views of
      human calculation, if properly conducted. This is the great purpose to which I look up to
      America as a naval and as a commercial power; how often have I indulged myself in these
      thoughts, unable to see the end of our glory from the same causes which have destroyed other
      states, little dreaming that one infatuated minister could tempt, seduce, and persuade a whole
      nation to cut the strings of such harmony. The. hon. gentleman who opened the debate, has
      remarked how we recovered from the interruptions of our commerce during the last war. The hon.
      gentleman forgets that we had the free and interrupted resources of America during the last
      war; that in seizing the ships of our enemies we added to the national wealth and increased
      our own commerce; the progress was double, here it runs in an inverse proportion, no man knows
      the final effects as yet; like the bursting of a burning mountain, it is sport and play to the
      distant spectators who think themselves safe, but the eruption may spread to cover this city
      in ruin. </P>

      at the Ports for which the respective Quantities of Saltpetre and Gunpowder shall be shipped,
      of the same having been duly landed at such Ports; in failure of which, the Bonds to be

   <P>The advantages that may attend the sending immediately a Force to the assistance of the
      Friends of Legal Government in the Four Southern Provinces of Virginia, North &amp; South
      Carolina, and Georgia, are so apparent, and have been so fully stated by yourself &amp; the
      Governors of the-other 3 Provinces, that the King has thought fit to order, that a Body of His
      Majesty's Forces, consisting of Seven Regiments, should prepare to embark at Corke about the
      1st of December, in order to proceed with 2 Companies of Artillery, &amp; a proper number of
      Battalion Guns, Howitzers, etc to Cape Fear River. </P>
   <P>You will see by the inclosed copy of a Letter to Major General Howe, that this separate Corps
      is to be commanded by one of the General Officers with him, and it will also fully instruct
      you as to the whole plan &amp; conduct of the Expedition; and I have only to add, that any
      corps of Provincials that may be formed upon this occasion, must be raised by your Authority,
      &amp; commanded by you as Provincial Colonel, with the same pay as a Colonel upon the British
      Establishment, but without any rank in the Army or claim to half pay, which for reasons I have
      already given cannot be allowed.</P>
   <P>You will observe that in the Letter to Major General Howe, the propriety of sending pilots
      with the Ship that carries the General Officer to Cape Fear River is particularly pointed out;
      but as it may be uncertain whether Pilots well acquainted with the coast of North Carolina,
      can be procured at Boston or New York, it will be very necessary that you should, with as much
      secresy as possible, engage a proper number to be put on board the Vessels that will be
      ordered (in conformity to the instructions already given) to cruize upon the coast until the
      Fleet &amp; Transports shall arrive. </P>
   <P>I am also Commanded by The King to suggest to you the great advantage &amp; utility that will
      attend the procuring, if practicable, a number of Carriages &amp; draft Horses, for the use of
      the Troops, in any operations they may findit necessary to carry on, and from what you have
      said of the disposition of some of the back Counties, I should hope it may not be
      impracticable, if managed with Secrecy &amp; caution</P>
   <P>The Parliament met yesterday &amp; inclosed I send you His Majesty's Speech to both Houses,
      together with their addresses in return thereto, which I trust will have the effect to
      convince the rebellious Inhabitants of the Colonies, of the firm Resolution of every branch of
      the Legislature, to maintain the dignity and authority of Parliament; desirous at the same
      time to receive with all proper Indulgence, the submission of any Colony that shall he
      inclined to return to its Duty and Allegiance. I am &amp;c</P>

   <P>I have forwarded, Sir, to the Prince of Masseran the same information which I had the honor to
      send you. We share the same views and we hide nothing from each other. I feel rather fortunate
      that my inclinations in this matter are in harmony with the execution of the King's orders.
      This Ambassador has recognized the consequences to which an establishment on the Mosquito
      Coast will lead. 3 But since he cannot speak openly to the Ministry about it without revealing
      the source of our information, and still awaiting the orders from his Court, he merely sounded
      the Ministers in this matter and observed in a general way that any such undertaking would be
      of a nature to disrupt the good harmony which now exists between both nations. </P>
   <P>News from the Ports. </P>

      complement of 350 men. </P>

   <P>Lorient, 27 October 1775.</P>
   <P>Following your request which Thad the honor to receive with your dispatch dated on the sixth
      of this month, and following the remarks addressed to you by the Count of Vergennes, with
      which you were so kind to acquaint me, I gathered the most exact information with regard to
      the unlading of foreign ships presently in this port. I found that the schooner Charming Polly
      of 70 freight tons, from Philadelphia, under the command of Mr. <name>Thomas Paton</name>, and belonging to
      <name>Thomas Masson</name> who is on board and who had come here last year in command of a small ship laden
      with tea from New England, had come to this port in behalf of the congress in order to buy
      gunpowder, rifles and saltpetre. Having found neither rifles nor gunpowder, she was to sail
      with the first strong winds laden with one hundred and some barrels of saltpetre. I prohibited
      the expedition of the latter pretending that I did not know whether the government would not
      retain it for its own use. I warned Mr. Berard with whom Masson had been dealing that he was
      not to allow this merchandise to go abroad without finding out first whether the department of
      ordnance [regie des poudres] had any use for it.</P>
   <P>There is also here a brigantine of one hundred freight tons, named Dune, under the command of
      Captain Craig, also from Philadelphia, and which was sent here with the same intentions. I
      know that the Captain went to Nantes by land in an attempt to buy war ammunition which he
      could not find. Since he grounded his ship on the sandbank of K.nevelle [?] in order to clean
      her, he said, I shall watch over the nature of the goods she will take on. In any case, I
      shall take all necessary measures to prevent ships coming from the English Colonies and
      returning there from taking on war ammunition.</P>
   <P>I learned that the transaction which was attempted here did take place in Bordeaux and that
      the Congress has empowered Mr. Masson to offer flour, tar, pitch, tobacco and generally all
      kinds of goods from the English Colonies to Mr. Berard in exchange for gunpowder, rifles and
      saltpetre; they are not interested in guns, cannon-balls or bullets. Furthermore, I see no
      difficulty in preventing the export of saltpetre, except to Holland with proper permits. We
      need not make public the reasons for this precaution; it is very easy, and as it happened.
      here, in spite of the deal and speculations made by Mr. Berard, all the saltpetre remained in
      his possession.</P>

   <P>Fontainebleau, 28 October 1775 </P>
   <P>No. 158</P>
   <P>Everything we hear in various places seems to confirm our doubts concerning the rumored
      expedition of Russian troops to America. But since in matters concerned with facts,
      conjectures can only be vicious, it will be most wise to wait until the events actually take
      place before we know what to believe and before we come to a decision. </P>
   <P>If the contract which the government is said to have signed with a wealthy Jew to provide
      supplies to 46 thousand men in America is as real as the source from which you have your
      information leads you to believe it, the expedition of 15 thousand Russians, as unlikely as it
      may appear, would be more likely than the levy of 12 thousand Canadians mentioned in the
      report. 2 If the English Ministry can count on this expedient for next year, why have they not
      used it this year? The solution to this problem would do less credit to their foresight than
      to their discernment. </P>
   <P>Sir, if Russia does not lower in any way her price of four million pounds sterling in exchange
      for a Russian expeditionary force, I do not believe that the British Government will put such
      a price on the help which the Great Catherine would extend to them. Such a request, if we
      accept it as true, is as good as a refusal. </P>

   <P>I find that the Comptroller of the Navy is well acquainted with the harbour of Cape Fear,
      &amp; that he is of opinion that ships even of twenty guns cannot get over the bar; it seems
      therefore absolutely necesary for us to be informed what kind of naval assistance will be
      wanted for the debarcation of the troops; for if it is expected that their landing should be
      covered by men of war, I much doubt whither that will be practicable for the reasons above
      mentioned. indeed I should think that before any decisive measure is taken it would be
      adviseable for your Lordship to have a consultation with Sir <name>Peter Parker</name>, the Comptroller of
      the Navy, Sir <name>Hugh Pallisser</name> &amp; myself as to the practicability of the naval part of this

   <P>[September 23 to October 30, 1775]</P>
   <P>after a passage of 5 Days [from El Ferrol] I dropt Anch'or the 27th in Port Lorient, &amp;
      being Sufficiently Acquainted with a Few Gentlemen, I made every Necessary Inquiry Respecting
      my outward bound Cargoe' and Nearly found my self in the Like situation as in Spain, Differing
      only in Two points - First a free Exportation of saltpeter to holland in any Bottom, But
      american - Second Nants had a peculiar privilege, over every other part of France, to the
      Coast of Gunia [Guinea] where all kinds of Millitary stores, is Lookt on as a Necessary
      article in Trade &amp; any Quantity, could be Exported in their own Bottoms - From the Nature
      of those advantages I was at a Loss which to Imbrace - to proceed to Nants and Charter a
      French Vessal to the Coast of Gunia &amp; their Discharge her - would Naturly Cause Delays
      &amp; Accumulate a heavy Expence, on the Concern - to Load my vessal with saltpeter for
      Holland, &amp; proceed to Philadelp[hia] would answer every purpose of my Voyage - But in this
      Case, its not complying with the Tennor of my orders, and in Case of Accident perhaps it may
      Involve me, into a Law suit - The Necessity of my Country is greate - the movements of
      Fore[ig]n powers very Cautious. after 2 Days this Reflecting, I concluded on the 29th of
      Septembr, to purchase the Saltpeter, But to my Surprise, no person would take my Bills - a
      Report prevailing that all american Creddit was at an End, in England - in this Situation I
      put my Bills of Exchange and Messrs Morris &amp; Wineys Letters of Creddit into the Hands of
      Berard Brothers 2 - to Forward them to London for Acceptance - which in Common takes 22 Days
      Before, you have advice of their Fate - But I had prevailed, on them Gentlemen, to Load the
      Schooner, &amp; in Case all my Bills came Back protested, the Vessal should be Dispatched with
      her Cargoe &amp; my self to stay as Hostage untill payment Came from America, or Security
      obtaind for the amount, from my Connections in England - my affairs Being thus aranged &amp;
      while Cleaning and prepairing the vessal to Take her Cargoe on Board - Capt [Charles] Biddle 3
      arived in the Brigg Chance with Cash &amp; other Credentials, to Load his Vessal on acct of
      Congress as he was a Stranger I introduced him To <name>Messrs Berard Brothers</name>, with a Request to
      give them Gentlemen, every Satisfactory Acct of my self &amp; those I were Concerned with -
      that in Case the Bills should come Back protested, they still would be safe in any amount, I
      may Contract with them - this Being done and the Gentlemen perfectly satisfy'd, the 15th of
      October I Began to Load &amp; by the 20th every thing Compleated &amp; nothing to prevent my
      sailing, but the Fate of the Bills - as I then was at Leasure Capt Biddle &amp; myself, had
      several consultations with <name>Messrs Berard Brothers</name>, Respecting the Loading of a French ship,
      &amp; mutually agreed, in Case I would proceed in her my self, they would advance me £ 1200
      Sterling on acct of Thomas Mason &amp; Co by the Thirds - which is agreable to Capt Biddles
      Declearation on his arival, her[e] &amp; the Timely prepearations of Mr Winey to have this
      proportion ready against my arivel - which was prevented by the Following, Viz On the 28th of
      October advice Came of the Acceptance of all my Bills Except those I had purchassed of Philip
      Moor[e] in this City, the Deficiencey, on my part amounting to £ 227.19 Sterling agreable to
      my account Current - By the same post a Letter Came from the prime minnister of France To the
      Commedant of the Port to Seaze my Vessel &amp; Discharge her Cargoe - Being thus situated,
      with a mind perplexed, put me under the Following Reflections, First, in the morning Early;
      the Guards will be put on Board &amp; my vessel &amp; Cargoe takeing from me - To take the
      Immediate advantage of the Night &amp; Run her out of the Harbour, Between the Close walls of
      Port Lewis, the Consiquences may be Fatal, by acting Contrary to their Laws in Case I should
      be Either stopt by their guns or Guard Boats Second-in Case not &amp; I proceed myself, I
      Leave a Joint Capital Behind me of £1156.5.3 Sterling - which of Course, as every thing on the
      principals of honour was Layd in as a Joint stock, I am Culpable for One Third - and in Case
      of Accident to those I Leave it with perhaps I Lay my self open to a prosicution for the whole
      amount - Third in Case I stay Behind to Secure this Sum, I must give the Command of my Vessel
      to another &amp; in Case of Accident on her passage - what may be the proceeding of my
      partners appears Dubious - from the precautious steps of the French, in our Contest - I have
      not had it in my power to Comply with the strict Limmets of my Orders &amp; View it in what
      Light I will - in Case of Accident, I have But Little Remedy, should they Incline to prosicute
      me - with these Reflections - I acquainted Capt Biddle &amp; proposed, in Case he would accept
      of the Command of my vessel &amp; proceed to Philadelphia - On my part I would Exicute his
      Business Commission Free - to which he accepted - and haveing but a Few hours to Spear - I
      wrote that Confused Letter To Thomas Mason &amp; Co which was Deliverd by Capt Biddle with the
      Original Invoice, To <name>Jacob Winey</name> on his arival - and now amongst my papers - the Night being
      Fare advanced, winds and weather Favourable to my Designs, by Day Light in the morning I had
      the pleasing satisfaction To Leave my schooner 3 miles without the port, in a Boat provided

   <Title>AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHARLES BIDDLE 1</Title>
   <P>[Lorient, October 30, 1775]</P>
   <P>It was a disagreeable and dangerous business I was on, for I was not acquainted with any
      person in France, and after an article that was prohibited from being sent out of the country.
      I had some letters with me from my old friend Pasquer, 2 but they were written long before I
      had any thoughts of going to France. As I knew Mr. Pasquer had an uncle in Nantes, I brought
      these letters, and with them introduced myself to Mr. Richard. I believe that was his name. He
      was a very respectable man, and received me with great politeness; and his son, who was an
      officer in the army, behaved very friendly. They both told me it was a very dangerous business
      I was upon, and appeared uneasy at my visiting them. I applied to some of the masters of ships
      I had known in Port au Prince, but they were afraid of me when they knew my business. One of
      them told me it was highly probable I would be taken up by the officers of the government if I
      remained much longer. Finding nothing to be done here, I set off for L'Orient by land. The
      roads are good, but the country not so thickly settled as I expected to find it. The horses
      were not good. I was determined on my arrival at L'Orient to sail for Holland, where I was
      ordered if powder and arms could not be had in France. However, it was left in a great measure
      to myself to do what I thought best. Upon my return to L'Orient, Captain [Thomas] Mason, of
      Philadelphia, was there in a schooner loaded with saltpetre bound home. He informed me the
      merchant who did his business proposed sending a ship for Philadelphia, with a great quantity
      of powder, arms, and other war-like stores. He told me if I would go in his schooner he would
      load the brig and bring her and the ship to Philadelphia. It was with great reluctance I
      consented to leave the brig, but as I could do it consistent with my instructions, and
      considered it would probably be of great advantage to my country, as Messrs. <name>Barard Freres</name>
      promised faithfully to send the ship if Mason stayed, fully relying on their promises and
      those of Mason, I went on board the schooner. We sailed from L'Orient the 30th of October. </P>

   <Title>ALEXANDER SCHAW TO LORD DARTMOUTH 1</Title>
   <P><name>My Lord</name></P>
   <P>Since I had the honour of attending your Lordship, I have employ'd my thoughts with much
      anxiety, on the plan of operations intended for North Carolina. I wishd to reduce them into
      writing. I will lay down a few facts as the foundation of what I wish to propose, that it may
      at once appear whether my oppinions arising from these facts are well or ill founded. </P>
   <P>In the province of North Carolina there are several rivers, which run a considerable way into
      the Country. Upon the south is Cape fear river which is navigable for ships of large burden,
      as far as a shoal which they call the fflatts, about seven miles above Brunswick town, which
      is situated 12 miles within the bar. In consequence of this impediment vessels, which have a
      drat of above 9 ½ feet water, cannot go up to Wilmington, which is the next port above and the
      most considerable town on the river even at spring tides, till they are lightned to that
      draught. Above or rather at Wilmington, the Northeast and. Northwest branches of the river
      join. The Northeast is the least considerable, and upon its whole extent there is no town,
      tho' its banks are very well settled. The Northwest branch is much larger and runs much
      farther into the Country. The first town is Cross creek about 100 miles above Wilmington. Here
      the whole trade with the back settlers is carried on, for a great way round. </P>
   <P>From ffort Johnston at the mouth of the river to Brunswick is 12 miles. From Brunswick to
      Wilmington there are two roads: one goes up the right Side of the river upon which Brµnswick
      stands and crosses two fferries opposite to Wilmington, occasioned by the river being there
      divided, by a large swampy Island thro' which there is a very bad road of a mile and a half.
      The length of this road is reckoned 16. Miles. To go by the other road, one must Cross a
      fferry at Brunswick of a mile over, from whence to Wilmington it is about ten miles. Every
      part of these roads, is more or less sandy. Some of them, for miles together is very deep, as
      the surface is often a pure white sand, without a particle of soil to bind it together. This
      is the Case with allmost every part of the province near the sea. The roads on both sides the
      river cross a few Water runs, which in the Country are called creeks: they are generally
      swampy along the sides, which are crowded with trees, bushes, vines &amp; brambles. Over all
      these Creeks are wooden bridges. Whenever the land is dry, there is little or no brush. The
      Woods in general are in the stile of open Groves in England, except in such places as have
      once been cleared and afterwards abandoned. These are allways covered with brush. The roads
      upon the North west branch of the river, grow more solid every mile above Wilmington, and long
      before they reach Cross creek are very hard. The only making they bestow upon the roads in the
      flat part of the Country is cutting out the trees to the necessary breadth, in as even a line
      as they can, and where the ground is wet, they make a small ditch on either side. The Roads
      thro' swamp land, are made by first laying logs in the direction of the road and covering them
      cross ways with small pine trees, layd regularly together over sod, with which the logs are
      previously covered. The roads run constantly thro the woods, which tho' they are generally
      pretty open, yet objects at any considerable distance, are intercepted from the eye, by the
      trees crouding into the line of direction as the distance increases. </P>
   <P>I thought it necessary to be so minute as this road along the west side of the North west
      branch, is that by which the junction of the provincials with the troops must be effected. </P>
   <P>The next navigable river to the Northward is the Neuse, upon which Newbern the Governours
      residence is situated, about fourty Miles from the sound. This river can admit only of small
      vesssels. </P>
   <P>Albemarle sound is the inlet to Roanoke river, upon which Edenton is situated 60 miles within
      land. And about 140, miles further up the River is Halifax which carries on a considerable
      trade: In the neighbourhood of Halifax; they have a good breed of horses, to the Southward the
      horses are smaller, but spirited and hardy. </P>
   <P>The lower parts of the province are subject to Agues, pleurisies &amp; bilious Complaints: the
      people of the back country are strangers to those disorders. </P>
   <P>The Rivers in the lower parts of the Country have no fords. Their banks are in general coverd
      with impenetrable swamps &amp; bottomless morasses, a very few spots excepted, upon which
      generaly plantations are settled. But in the back country, they have good fords. </P>
   <P>The settlements upon the lower part of Capefear river do not produce grain enough,
      particularly wheat, to answer their own demands. Large quantities are therefore sent down from
      Cross creek in row boats, which in return carry up whatever goods are wanted for the use of
      the back settlers. </P>
   <P>Every proprietor of ever so small a piece of land, raises some Indian Corn &amp; sweet
      potatoes, &amp; breeds some hoggs &amp; a calf or two; and a man must be very poor who walks a
      foot. </P>
   <P>Brunswick country where the troops must first land, contains fewer of the lower class of
      country people, than any part of the whole province, particularly near the sea. </P>
   <P>There is no specie in the province, and there never was a person who could command a sum of
      any consequence even of their paper currency. Nothing in the stile of a Banker or money
      Merchant was ever-heard of. </P>
   <P><name>Governour Tryon</name> left the province very soon after the submission of the Regulators, and when
      Colonel [Josiah] Martin succeeded to the Government, their wounds were still bleeding, and
      the[y] had received no protection, from the oppression of the petty fogging attorneys, whose
      rapacity had been the original cause of their rebellion. <name>Governour Martin</name> arrived in the
      province at this very critical time. He made a progress thro' his Government; and when we was
      in this part of the Country, his attention to the releif of these poor people was such as won
      him their highest confidence &amp; esteem. </P>
   <P>There is now a numerous body of the Sons &amp; grandsons of the first scotch highland settlers
      besides the later emigrants who retain that enthusiastick love for the country from which they
      are descended, which indeed scarce a highlander ever loses, that they will support its dignity
      at every risk. The Governour has attached them strongly to him, as well as the later emigrants
      by many services he has had opportunities of doing them Many highland gentlemen are now in
      that country, several of whom have been officers, and still retain their influence among the
      people. </P>
   <P>Many of the people of the largest property in the Country, tho' they now languish under the
      hand of oppression, will instantly join, to support the Constitution, upon the first
      appearance of a chance of support. </P>
   <P>The low country people in general have fire arms. I never was in a house without seeing one or
      more muskets. Indeed the Militia laws require them to have them. The highland emigrants
      carried few arms with them, and the regulators delivered up the greatest part of theirs to
      <name>Governour Tryon</name>. </P>
   <P>The six iron guns that were at the Governours house dismounted &amp; spiked up, are now in the
      hands of the rebels with several ship guns, they took from a Mr Cornell, at Newbern. They have
      got two more guns at Wilmington &amp; probably, if the Cruizer sloop has left her station,
      they have carried off, some of the Guns at ffort Johnston. There is reason however to beleive
      they have neither powder nor shot for these guns. </P>
   <P>These things being premised, I shall now, with the utmost diffidence lay before your Lordship,
      a few Ideas that have occurrd to me in the Course of my thinking upon this subject </P>
   <P>It appears from the account I have given of the soil near the sea, and of the swampy branches
      or Creeks, which cross the roads, and the small size of the horses, that it would be a matter
      of great difficulty, to transport heavy cannon &amp; waggons, either into the interior part of
      the country or along the Coast. At the same time it is absolutely necessary to have a good
      train of Artilery as it was owing to his cannon in a great measure, perhaps solely, that
      Governor Tryon defeated the regulators: for the fire of his musketry made no impression upon
      them. And perhaps it would be an improvement, to use balls upon the occasion smaller than
      common, as at the short distance they must be used at, the effect of the smaller shot would be
      in proportion to their numbers. </P>
   <P>Trenching &amp; pioneers tools will be necessary in a large proportion, as there may be often
      occasion to repair the Causeways, as they call them, across the swampy runs, and perhaps to
      make bridges over the larger ones, if the 'enemy should destroy them, or if they should be
      found not to be strong enough which is a very possible case, as they are constructed for light
      carriages only.</P>
   <P>It cannot be supposed that the people to be raised have any camp necessaries, such as kettles,
      lanterns &amp;c. these should be provided for them, and indeed the more care is taken of them
      they will do their duty the better. </P>
   <P>It would be proper to send out, some alert Soldiers qualified, to be Sergeants &amp; Corporals
      for the express purpose of training the provincial regiments, which would soon make them far
      superior to the rebells, who have very few helps of that kind. </P>
   <P>I have allready observed that the town of Brunswick which indeed is but a stragling village,
      is 12. miles, within the barr. At low water there is ten feet water upon the barr, at spring
      tides there is from 19 to 20 feet so that in fine weather ships of deep draught can easily go
      in. The water, both below &amp; above the flatts is deep enough for any vessel, Vessels can
      run from the Barr to Brunswick in three, or four hours with the tide, with allmost any wind.
      There is good anchorage within half musket shot of the town. The bank is pretty high for this
      Country, and the woods are cut down a good way round the town, tho' there are shrubby bushes.
      An encampment there, cannot be Commanded, as there is no higher ground, and the approaches to
      the Camp can easily be defended on the land side, and if there should be any sick, the houses
      would serve as good hospitals. There is plenty of water. This is the only town on the right or
      west side of the river, so that should a body of the rebells attempt to harrass the troops as
      they have no tents nor camp implements of any kind, they must soon disperse without a blow.
      But there would be little risk of any immediate attempt of this kind if some of the lightest
      vessels, properly armed &amp; having defences musket proof, with a few troops on board were
      instantly sent up to Wilmington. The town would submit, as most of the Inhabitants are well
      affected, and by having one ship at the town and another a little higher at Mr Harnets
      plantation, all communication, from the North east to the North-west river, especially across
      the Northwest, would be renderd next to impossible for many miles up And wherever it was
      attempted, it could only be done by a few men, as there is no way even for a single horse
      thro' the swamps on the river sides. There could then be little difficulty in effecting the
      junction with the highlanders &amp; provincials from Cross creek and the adjoining
      Counties.</P>
   <P>Brunswick county as I have said is thinly settled, consequently, cattle and horses are few,
      especially near the sea; but these and every thing else the province affords, will be
      plentifully supplied from the back country, when the people march to make a junction, which if
      the previous steps go successfully on, may be effectuated in ten or twelve days, after
      disembarking the troops </P>
   <P>If a superiority was once obtaind in this part of the Country, which one would think nothing
      but some very unforseen accident would prevent, it is next to certain, that every other part
      might be soon reduced. The Ringleaders must fly: and the people would infallibly submit upon
      promise of pardon &amp; protection. And here let me mention, that a great many copies of a
      proper proclamation from the King should be printed, in order to be dispersed wherever a man
      could be found to read them, which would open the eyes of the poor country people, who have
      been most amazingly deluded. </P>
   <P>Now supposing things to have succeeded at Cape fear, it may be proper to detach a part of the
      regulars, with a body of the provincial troops by sea and to land them in Albemarle sound,
      where the inhabitants of Currituck and Pasquotonk, with many of, the people, round them are
      well affected, as well as their neighbours mthat part of Virginia which is next them. And if a
      previous plan can be settled with the loyal gentlemen in that part of the Country, they could
      prepare their people for taking Arms to join the forces upon their landing so that the rebells
      in the middle counties would then be betwixt two fires if they ventur'd to stand out. </P>
   <P>There is little to be apprehended from South Carolina, they are too weak to think of sending
      troops out of their province; and should they be mad enough, a report that their negroes were
      to be declared free, would secure them effectualy at home. The only chance the rebells would
      have of support is from Virginia. Yet as that province is so much cut by Rivers, a few hundred
      men in armed vessels, by making descents in different places would keep the whole province in
      alarm and harrass them extremly independant of what Lord Dunmore hopes to be able to
      accomplish.</P>
   <P>I have allready mentioned the scarcity of money in this province. The provincial troops must
      be payd: and many other services require ready money. </P>
   <P>But the point of all others upon which the raising a force in this Country most depends is
      <name>Governour Martin</name>, being at the head of every thing. I mentioned the necessity of it to your
      Lordship, and I beg leave to repeat it. Your Idea my Lord of local rank, will I hope do. Yet
      from rank in America only, I am afraid he never will be considered by the gentlemen of the
      Country as having that importance at home which real rank in the Army, would appear to them to
      give him. </P>
   <P>I have perhaps my Lord in this long paper, given my oppinion with a great deal more freedom
      than I had a right to do, but as the sole object of my coming to England, was to lay before
      your Lordship, whatever hints, my small knowledge or Abilities furnished me with, I have done
      it without reserve, tho' not without that diffidence, which every man must feel, when writing
      upon subjects of such high importance. I have the honour to be <name>My Lord</name> [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P><name>My Lord</name></P>
   <P>My first Conversation with Mr <name>de Vergennes</name> was a pretty long one, and as friendly as possible
      - After the first Compliments were over, He said &quot;You find us here, <name>My Lord</name>, exactly in
      the same Sentiments in which you left us - desirous of living in perfect Harmony with you, and
      very far from meaning to do anything that can tend to encrease the Embarras of your present
      critical Situation&quot; - I answered that We relied entirely upon the repeated assurance They
      had given us of their Friendship, which would always meet with a suitable Return on our Part,
      as I was authorized to declare in The King's Name, in the Audience which I was ordered to
      demand for that Purpose - I added that after all They had said upon the Subject, and with the
      Justice We did to the Sincerity of the present french Ministry, and to their fair and frank
      manner of treating We could not but be persuaded that They never would give the American
      Rebels any sort of Countenance, - Assistance or Supply, but I observed to Him, that it was
      very possible that attempts of that kind might be made, and escape all their Vigilance; and
      that whenever we had any Suspicion of that Nature, We should communicate it to them, that they
      might take the Proper Steps to prevent Attempts contrary to those friendly Sentiments and
      Intentions, which they had so often declared, and on which We loved to rely - He answered that
      no Power on Earth, ever did or could prevent all Illicit Trade, which the Prospect of great
      Gain, would lead Men to attempt at every Hazard, and then quoted the famous answer of that
      Dutch Merchant, who said that if a Lucrative Trade could be carried on with Hell, he would
      send his Ships thither au Risque de bruler leur Voiles. - &quot;But, continued He - whatever
      We can prevent We certainly will. The Intelligence you had of Ammunition being sent by the
      Governor of St. Domingo proves upon Inquiry to be void of all Truth - We found upon
      Examination, that far from being able to supply others, He had not a sufficient Provision for
      Himself - That Defficiency well supplied, but I again assure you that no Ammunition Stores or
      Assistance of any kind shall be sent to North America either by the Governor of <name>St Domingo</name>, or
      any other Governor or Prrson whatever, that is under our Controle, and that We will sincerely
      and bona fide prevent every thing that could be to your Detriment, as far as it is possible
      for any Government to prevent it&quot; - After I had said a few Words to thank Him for these
      Promises He of his own Accord, went on with the general Subject, which He entered into pretty
      largely - He began with saying &quot;Loin de vouloir augmenter Vos Embarras, Nous les voions
      avec quelque Peine&quot; (that was his very expression) and then after a short Pause added -
      &quot;Ce qui vous arrive en Amerique n'est de la Convenance Personne&quot; I answered that I
      was sure the Consequences could not escape a Man of his Reflexion and Penetration, and so used
      to extend his Views - To this He replied that He might venture to say, that they did not
      escape Him - &quot;indeed added He, they are very obvious, as obvious as the Consequences of
      the entire Cession of Canada. I was at Constantinople when the last Peace was made. When I
      heard the Conditions, I told several of my Friends there, that I was persuaded England would
      not be long before She had Reason to repent of having removed the only check that could keep
      Her Colonies in Awe. My Prediction has been but too well verified - I think I equally see the
      Consequences, that must follow the Independance of North America, if your Colonies ever should
      carry that Point, which they now so visibly aim at. In that Case they would immediately set
      about forming a great Marine, and as they have every possible advantage for Ship-building
      would not be long before they had such Fleets, as would be an over-match for the whole Naval
      Power of Europe, could it be united against them. With this Superiority and every advantage of
      Situation they might when they pleased, conquer both Your Islands and Ours. I am persuaded
      that they would not stop here, but would in Process of Time advance to the Southern Continent
      of America, and either subdue the Inhabitants, or carry them along with them, and in the end,
      not leave a foot of that Hemisphere in the Possession of any European Power. All these
      Consequences would not, indeed be immediate. Neither you nor I should live to see them, but
      for being remote they are not less sure. Short sighted narrow Policy may indeed, rejoice in
      every Destress of a Rival, without looking beyond the present Hour, but He who looks forward,
      and thinks of and weighs Consequences, must consider what now happens to you in America, as a
      General Evil, of which every Nation that has Settlements there, has its Share, and in that
      Light, I assure you, it has always appeared to Mc&quot; - All this <name>My Lord</name> Mr <name>de Vergennes</name>
      said entirely of his own Accord, and with the Air and Manner of a Man, who speaks his Real
      Opinion. Your Lordship will easily believe, that I expressed great Satisfaction at finding Him
      in such Sentiments, fell in and applauded his Reasoning, which I did with the better Grace, as
      He sees the Object in the same Light in which it has always struck Mc, I am as much convinced
      as He possibly can be, that not only our own future Fate, but much of the General Fate of
      Europe is involved, in our present unhappy Contest, and that this and every other Nation that
      has Settlements in America ought to wish Us Success, whether they readdy do so or not, I
      pretend not to say.</P>
   <P>After my Audience I made a Visit to Mr <name>de Maurepas</name>, 2 and told Him that the Language The King
      his Master, had held to Me could not but be highly agreeable to my Court. He answered that He
      had already seen Mr <name>de Vergennes</name> and knew what had passed at my Audience, and then added
      &quot;Je suis bien aise que <name>Le Roi</name> vous ait parle comme je nais qu'il pense. Soiez sur Melord,
      que Nous ne sommes pas Gens que cherchent a abuser des Circonstances et a pecher dans l'Eau
      trouble. Our Wish and Intention is to live in Peace and Friendship with you to maintain the
      public Tranquillity and to arrange the Affairs of our own Interior in the best Manner We
      can.&quot; I answered that I was persuaded that was - the Real Plan of the present Ministry
      and that it was every way worthy of their Wisdom, and then repeated a Part of what I had said
      to Mr <name>de Vergennes</name> of our entire Reliance upon the assurances they had given Us, that they
      never would furnish the American Rebels with Ammunition or Stores of any kind He said -
      &quot;be assured We do not and will not directly or indirectly give them any Sort of
      Assistance you had a Notion that the Governor of <name>St Domingo</name> had sent them Gunpowder, but We
      find, upon the strictest Examination, that it was a groundless Report&quot; - We then, My
      Lord, spoke a little of the general Temper of the Nation, observed that it was strongly with
      Administration, which He said, was a great Point at all Times, but particularly in such
      Contests as these, and very properly, I think, attributed this general Disposition to the
      Americans having now clearly shewn, that they aim at absolute Independance. &quot;Opinions,
      said He, may, be devided about this or that Measure; as for Instance, whether it was right or
      wrong to attempt to tax the Americans, but now that they shew that what they aim at is Une
      Independence absolue. Votre Nation sont bien que cette Independance ne sauvoit Lui
      convenir&quot; </P>
   <P>In this Respect at least, <name>My Lord</name>, I am persuaded both Mr <name>de Maurepas</name>, and Mr <name>de Vergennes</name> see
      the Thing in its true point of View, and are convinced that the Americans wish to be
      independent, and will make themselves so, if they can - Mr <name>de Maurepas</name>, who always treats me
      as an old Acquaintance, talked to me with great seeming frankness and cordiality. He is
      perfectly well and has the appearance of a Man who is pleased with his Situation, - and is
      firm in the Saddle - I made my Visit short, as many People of the first fashion were waiting
      in his outward Room. </P>
   <P>I have now given Your Lordship a particular, and I am afraid, too long an Account of what
      passed in these first Conversations the only interesting ones I have as yet had with either of
      the above-mentioned Ministers - I think I have omitted nothing material - I am sure I have
      added nothing of my own. I am [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>I arrived here last Evening &amp; informed <name>His Excellency</name> of your Attention &amp; Assistance
      in Negociating the transportation of the flour from your port, to Ipswich &amp; Salem. I have
      it in Command from the General to return you his thanks, and at the Same [time] to inclose you
      his instructions to the Agents appointed for the Armed Vessels now fitted or hereafter may be
      fitted out for the publick Service, I doubt not you will pay proper Attention to them and to
      any farther instructions you may hereafter receive from Head Quarters, you have also inclosed,
      the List of Provisions necessary to be laid in for One Month, for 50 Men which is the
      Compliment for the Schooners fitted out to Cruize on the Coast, those that are gone out to Sea
      have 75 Men, your situation is such that exc[e]pt a Cruizer takes a prize, I dont apprehend
      you will have many visits [from], therefore I am of opinion that a few barrels of Beef &amp; a
      few of Pork, with some Bread will be Sufficient for you to Lay in at present, perhaps his
      Excellency may hereafter think proper to appoint a particular Vessel for your port, then it
      will be necessary for you to provide the other Articles mentioned in the List -</P>

      extended their Influence over the British Parliament, that by a prostituted Majority it is now
      become a political Engine of Slavery: And Whereas, the Military Tools of these our unnatural
      Enemies, while restrained by the united Forces of the American Colonies from proceeding in

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> Novr 1 1775</P>
   <P>The 22d of last Month Mr Lobb delivered me your two Letters Octr 9 with the Extract of two
      Letters therein mentioned from Governor Tryon. When I mentioned that I could not at present
      determine upon the propriety of your Conduct in firing upon those who were stealing the Guns,
      and had killed one of your People,2 I did not mean to condemn what you had done, but wished
      that by some vigorous effort you could have compelled the City to return the Guns they had so
      scandalously permitted to be taken away, and perhaps with a Design to disgrace the King's
      Officers immediately on the Spot. Upon reconsidering the matter I am happy nothing more was
      done; the Action though extremely impudent and provoking was certainly not of sufficient
      turpitude to occasion the destruction of the City, especially at that Juncture when you was
      unprovided with Instructions how to act in such Cases.</P>
   <P>I am extremely pleased your firing upon the Battery did not occasion those restraints we
      expected; and I hope to whatever Cause the Quiet of the City may be attributed they will yet
      have the Wisdom speedily to return to their Duty, and no longer suffer their present delusion
      to operate to their Ruin. I heartily wish you may seize some of the Ringleaders.</P>
   <P>I send back the Viper to you; Captain [Samuel] Graves carries with him Shirts, Frocks,
      Trowsers, Shoes, and the Rope you have desired.</P>
   <P>I approve of your detaining and disposal of the Viper. The intention of a Sloop with you is to
      be employed in the most effectual manner for the good of the Kings Service; And it was
      certainly right not to trust the Mails in the Charlotte, 3 when by tarrying a few days they
      might go with so much greater Safety in the Viper. </P>
   <P>General Gage was sailed for England when your Letter arrived vindicating yourself against the
      Complaint of <name>Lieutt Campbell</name>, which indeed I had done before, but I shewed it to General
      [William] Howe, and you may rest assured we are perfectly satisfied with your Representation
      of the Matter and that Mr Campbells Complaint was without Reason.4 </P>
   <P>The several Intelligencies contained in your Letter are very satisfactory, and I beg you will
      accept my thanks for the Communication of them. I am &amp;c </P>

   <Title>LETTER TO THE PRINTER OF PINKNEY's <name>Virginia Gazette</name> 1 </Title>
   <P>Hampton, November 1, 1775. </P>
   <P>MR. PRINTER, </P>
   <P>For the satisfaction of the public, I shall endeavour to give you as true an account of the
      late matters at this place as I am able. </P>
   <P>Last Wednesday night [October 25] a party of men from the tenders went on shore, and robbed
      several houses on <name>Mill Creek</name>, nigh Hampton. We heard of this the next morning, and observed
      the tenders at anchor, no great distance from the place where several vessels had been sunk in
      the channel of Hampton river, to prevent their surprizing us. The channel was not completely
      stopped, and we imagined, from their situation they intended to prevent our compleating the
      work, or perhaps might intend to land, to be at their old trade. However, to observe their
      motions particularly, captain [George] Lyne, in the minute service, rode round nigh where the
      tenders lay, and left orders for his lieutenant (Mr. Smith) with 30 men, to come over to him,
      by crossing one of the branches of Hampton river. In a short time after captain Lyne had fixed
      himself on the point, lieutenant Smith was over with the men, and then two vollies of
      musquetry were discharged from the tenders, and answered by captain Lyne from his post by a
      rifle, which was answered by a four pounder from one of the tenders; then began a pretty warm
      fire from all the tenders. Captain [George] Nicholas, observing this, soon joined about 25 of
      his men. The fire of our musquetry caused the tender nighest to us to sheer off some distance.
      The fire consisted of 4 pounders, grape shot &amp;c. for about one hour. Not a man of our's
      was hurt. Whether our men did any damage is uncetain. They could not get nigher than 300
      yards. Some say they saw men fall in one of the tenders. After waiting under cover nigh the
      shore, and finding they would not land, the men were ordered to retreat to the woods, to try
      whether that would not induce them to land; but all in vain as long as we stayed. The men were
      then marched into Hampton, and about 5 o'clock in the afternoon some of them landed, and burnt
      Mr. <name>Edward Cooper</name>'s house. In the night they cut a passage through the vessels that were sunk,
      and the next morning, about 8 o'clock (which was about half an hour after colonel Woodford and
      captain Bluford arrived with a rifle company) 5 tenders, to wit, a large schooner, 2 sloops,
      and 2 pilot boats, passed the passage they had cleared, and drew up a-breast of the town; they
      then gave 3 chears, and began a heavy fire. Colonel Woodford immediately posted captain
      Nicholas with his company on one side of the main street, and captain Bluford with his
      riflemen on the other, who were joined by the town company of militia; captain Lyne with his
      company was ordered to march to the cross roads just out of town to sustain any attack that
      might come from James or Back river. The colonel had been informed that men were landed from
      both these rivers. The musquet and rifle balls soon began to fly so thick that few men were
      seen upon the decks. The engagement continued very warm for some time. At length they began to
      cut and slip their cables, and all cleared themselves, except one, which was boarded and taken
      by some of our men. They took in her the gunner and 7 men, 3 of whom were wounded, 2 mortally
      (both since dead), 1 white woman, and 2 negro men; lieutenant Wright, who commanded the prize,
      after receiving a ball, jumped overboard, and it is thought he was not able to reach the
      tenders. Several more jumped overboard; but it is not known what is become of them, or what
      damage is done on board of the other tenders. In those 2 different actions, Mr. Printer,
      officers and soldiers of the regular, minute, and militia, acted with a spirit becoming
      freemen and Americans, and must evince that Americans will die, or be free! </P>

   <P>CAPTAIN <name>SAMUEL LESLIE</name> To MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAM HowE 1</P>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Gosport Virginia 1st Novr 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir: I have the honour to inform you that I landed the 12th of last month at 11 o'Clock at
      night about three miles from hence with <name>Lieut Lawrie</name>, two Serjeants, &amp; forty rank and file
      of the 14th Regiment, and after marching three miles into the country in search of Artillery
      we found in a wood nineteen pieces of cannon, some of them twelve, others nine, six &amp;
      three pounders; seventeen of which we destroyed, &amp; brought off two, and then returning to
      our boats we reimbarked without the least opposition. - Lord Dunmore accompanied us upon this
      expedition: -</P>
   <P>On the 17th of October his Lordship was informed, that there was a great quantity of
      Artillery, small arms and all sorts of ammunition, concealed in different stores at a place
      called Kemp's landing, in consequence of which, I, with Capt Cooper, <name>Lieuts Batut</name>, Lawrie,
      &amp; Leslie, Ensigns Wools, Boys, Ogle, &amp; Lindsay, three Serjeants &amp; seventy rank
      &amp; file of the 14th Regiment, <name>Lieut Allen</name>, one Serjeant and twenty marines, some young
      gentlemen of the Navy &amp; ten or twelve seamen, embarked at 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon in
      boats &amp; a Schooner in which some Guns were mqunted to cover our landing, and proceeded
      seven or eight miles up the eastern branch of Elizabeth river to Newtown, where we landed
      without opposition notwithstanding above two hundred of the rebels were at exercise near that
      place the same evening, and marching three or four miles through the Country we arrived at
      Kemp's landing a little after it was dark, where we searched several stores and could discover
      nothing but a good many small arms, musquet locks, a little powder &amp; ball, two Drums,
      &amp; a quantity of Buck shot, all which we either brought off or destroyed; and returning
      pretty near the same road we went we reimbarked about 2' oClock the next morning without
      interruption. We likewise took several prisoners one of whom was a Captain of Minute, men and
      another a Delegate of the Convention at Richmond. 2</P>
   <P>I have also the pleasure to acquaint your Excellency that Lieut Batut with two Serjeants and
      Thirty six rank &amp; file landed at Norfolk the 19th of October at 12 'oClock at noon and
      marching into the Country two miles from thence, took twenty pieces of cannon (from six to
      three pounders) concealed in a wood, thirteen of which he destroyed &amp; brought away seven;
      and returned about 4 'oClock in the Afternoon unmolested. </P>
   <P>Many great guns, small arms, &amp; other implements of war have been taken since by small
      parties, so that there has been in all at least seventy seven pieces of ordinance taken &amp;
      destroyed since my Detachment arrived here without the smallest opposition, which is a proof
      that it would not require a very large force to subdue this Colony. There are about eight
      hundred of the rebels now at Williamsburg &amp; four hundred at Hampton. We are in possession
      of a large store on the banks of the Southern branch of Elizabeth river, under cover of the
      Otter sloop of war, so that we are not very apprehensive of an attack tho' the Rebels often
      threaten to pay us a visit. As our situation is so extremely critical I flatter myself that
      you will be so good as to send us a reinforcement as soon as possible, particularly the two
      Companies of our Regiment at Boston or Castle William. The rest of the Regiment we expect from
      St Augustine as soon as it is relieved by three Companies of the 16th from Pensacola. There
      are thirty men of my Detachment on board Lord Dunmores ship &amp; another one that his
      Lordship has taken up for a transport.</P>
   <P>I have been favoured with your Excellency's letter of the 12th of September wherein you inform
      me that my Detachment must be supplied with provisions by the Contractors of St Augustine,
      &amp; that the King must pay the transportation of them from thence, which mode of supply I am
      well assured will be impracticable at this time, for we never could be sure of being furnished
      with them regularly as vessels cannot be procured for that purpose, &amp; even if they could
      they would be in constant danger of being taken by the Rebels, and besides, fresh provisions
      is much cheaper &amp; better for the men than salt, and the expence of the transportation of
      the latter from St Augustine would be by all accounts almost as much as the former will cost
      here. However, Lord Dunmore says that he will take upon him self to have whatever troops may
      arrive here properly supplied in the meantime, and his Lordship thinks that there ought to be
      a particular Contractor appointed for this Colony exclusive of any other.</P>
   <P>Capt Fordyce, with Lieuts Napier &amp; Wallace, three Serjeants, three Corporals, two
      Drummers, and fifty five private men arrived here from St Augustine the 20th of last month,
      from whence he brought some ammunition, bedding, &amp; provisions; and was prevented from
      bringing a greater quantity of the two last articles by Governor [Patrick] Tonyn's giving
      positive orders to the Agent of the Contractors and the Barrack Master not to issue more on
      their peril. I do myself the honour to enclose your Excellency two Monthly returns by one of
      which you will see that Capt Blackett died here the 14th of last month, in consequence of
      which I flatter myself that Capt <name>James Urquhart</name> will succeed to the Company, Lieut William
      Brown to the Capt Lieutenancy, and Ensign Thos Appleford Wools to the Lieutenancy, as they are
      all very worthy men &amp; good officers. 3 </P>

   <P>From on board His Majesty's Ship Tamer, the lst of November 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>The many unprovoked insults the King's servants in this province have received, from those
      Assemblies who have had the hardiness to assume the reins of government, are too numerous, and
      too well known, to make it necessary for me to mention them. I will confine myself entirely to
      what relates to my own department, and the trust reposed in me.</P>
   <P>I therefore address you, Sir, as a principal actor in the measures now adopted, and desire you
      will acquaint your associates, and all others whom it may concern, that if his Majesty's
      agents in Charlestown, are not permitted, regularly and without molestation, to supply the
      King's ships Tamer and Cherokee, under my command, with such provisions as I think necessary
      to demand; I am determined, from this day, not to suffer any vessel to enter into, or depart
      from Charlestown, that it is in my power to prevent. </P>
   <P>The bearer of this, is owner of a vessel, who has unloaded materials at the King's fort, which
      is now held in contempt and defiance of his Majesty's authority; and, whatever pretexts this
      man may use to colour his disloyalty, I never will suffer his vessel to depart, till Walker,
      the gunner of the King's fort, now a prisoner at the barracks, and who I look upon as under my
      protection, is sent on board the Tamer. Savages ought to blush at the return the King's
      servants have received, for their humanity to one of the most infamous and most ungrateful of
      Villians, in whose service this poor man has suffered. I am, Sir, [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>by unfavorable Winds &amp; weather we have been able to make but little head since our last -
      the 31st of Octobr some way off this Harbour we saw a Vessel 2 standing to the Northward which
      Capta Selman &amp; I gave chase to; the Wind Springing up sudingly to a heavy gale, she bore
      away for this Harbour for safety; we pursued her directly in, &amp; found her to be a Sloop
      belonging to <name>Enoch Rust</name> of Boston, who last Spring had the Sloop cleard out from Hallifax with
      Provision for Quebec, the Sloop has since taken a Cargo of Provision from Louisburgh for the
      west Indies; contrary as we apprehend to the Association of the united american Colonies, the
      Owner now at Canso we have reason to believe is not a favorer of our Cause as the Capta (James
      Hawkins) told us he was lately undetermined whether he should go to Boston this Fall or not;
      The smallest Intention of going to that Den of Mischievous Violators of the rights of
      Humanity, must carry in the bosom of it as we concieve the Idea of Friendliness to their
      infernal Intentions, we upon the whole concieve ourselfes bound in obedience to your
      Excellencys Instructions to send the Vessel to a friendly port in New England upon her
      Arrival, your Excellency will have the Vessels Papers laid before you &amp; will do respecting
      Vessel &amp; Cargo as you may please The Master will be sent to New England the first
      Opportunity aftr this </P>
   <P>Capta Hawkins about the Middle of September saw a Ship &amp; a Brigantine going up the river
      <name>St Lawrence</name> but did not speak with either the Master informs that there was no Vessel of Force
      at Quebec the beginning of September &amp; that he knows of none going up since he likewise
      says that a large Brigantine was lately (&amp; he believes is not yet saild) loading with Coal
      at Spanish River on the Island of Loisburgh for Boston; &amp; that three or four Score Boston
      Men have been diging Coal there, for the Ministerial Army for the season. we shall hoist Sail
      directly the wind breasing rather favorably &amp; pursue our Course </P>

   <P>The distress'd situation to which this Town and the adjacent Country is reduced by the Efforts
      of our cruel and unnatural Enemies induces to me, as Colonel of a Regiment in this County, by
      the People elected, to implore the attention of the Hon. Council for our Safety -</P>
   <P>The destruction of the greatest part of the Town, has brought so many Families into distress
      that a great part of the Country are busied in providing for their Relief - &amp; a whole
      Regiment from this County being now at Head Quarters (saving a few returned on Furlow) we are
      left very defenceless. Addg to this our great want of Ammunition having only two half barrels
      in Stock &amp; of some able Person to conduct the few Forces raised for protection of the Sea
      Coast. I am concern'd, much concem'd for the Safety of the Country - The Ship Cerberus Captain
      Symons, came in to our Harbour yesterday with a number of Armed Men said to be about 400, I
      expect every minute they will land &amp; attempt to take Possession of our Neck &amp; fortify
      it for a place of rendezvous for a Fleet I have order'd the Militia to be muster'd but I am
      unable myself to head them - I hope they will make a spirited opposition - but our want of
      Podr &amp; of some proper Person to conduct I fear will prove our Defeat. and if there is not
      some Provision. made by the Court for our Defence. the Country will be detroyed - and our
      People obliged to flee for Shelter to the Westward or suffer in the Wilderness - or which God.

      Those we expect will in a few hours land &amp; take possession of the To[w]n - How soon they

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 2 Novr 1775. I wrote you fully by the Pallas Transport, which sailed from hence
      the 12th Ulto with General Gage on board: The next day upon advices received from Canada,
      General Howe applied to me for a Convoy to some Transports intended to carry two Regiments to
      Quebec. As they could not be got ready to sail until the end of October, I consulted the
      Captains with me and others well acquainted with the River <name>St Lawrence</name> upon the probability of
      their getting up. All the Gentlemen were of opinion it was so late in the Season that Winter
      would be set in too severely by the time the Ships could get in the River <name>St Lawrence</name>, and
      that hard Gales of Wind and Snow Storms would not only prevent their getting up, but perhaps
      endanger the loss of the whole Convoy. I intended to have sent the Cerberus; but, upon my
      communicating to General Howe the danger there was of the Troops neither getting to Quebec,
      nor returning here again, he gave up all thoughts of sending any to Canada this fall. </P>
   <P>The 12th the Nautilus anchored in Nantasket and the next day I received a Letter from Capt.
      Collins a Copy of which is inclosed. Wishing to continue as much force as possible in the Bay,
      I ordered him to cruize another Week, and then come up to Boston and get ready to go to the
      Southward with Lord Dartmouths Dispatches for the Governors of his Majesty's Southern
      Colonies. </P>
   <P>The Cerberus being now caulked, victualled and in all respects fit for Sea, I directed the
      Scarborough to take her Station in <name>Charles Town</name> River, and Captain Symons to cruize between
      Cape Cod and <name>Cape Anne</name> until the Mercury returned from convoying the Pallas Transport, then to
      extend his Cruize to Casco Bay, visiting Piscatagua and the Isle of Shoals as he found
      Opportunity. </P>
   <P>One Division of Transports with live Cattle and Forage for the Army arrived the 16th from
      Annapoli[s.] On the 18th the Nautilus came up from her Cruizes Captain Collins being in a very
      ill State of health. I granted him Leave to be on shore while the Sloop is getting ready again
      for Sea. The Falcon returned this day from New Providence with the Transports; and I had the
      pleasure to find by Captain Linzee the Inhabitants are determined to defend themselves against
      the Rebels and to approve themselves good Subjects to his Majesty. Governor [Montfort] Browne
      was absent, but Captain Linzee having received'a Letter from the President of the Counsil (a
      Copy of which is inclosed) 2 he came away. </P>
   <P>I have stationed the Falcon to the Southward of Boston; and the Nautilus, while she remains
      here, guards the Mouth of Winnisimmet River. </P>
   <P>The Swan arrived from Rhode Island with two Transports having on board live Cattle, Poultry,
      Wood &amp;c for the Fleet. On the 22d the Charlotte Sloop also returned from New York and
      Rhode Island with Letters from Captains Vandeput and Wallace; The former having detained an
      Inhabitant of New York upon an accusation of being concerned in burning the Asia's Barge; Many
      Affidavits transmitted to me proving I think beyond a Doubt the accused Person was not present
      at the time nor any ways aiding or assisting, And Application being also made by the Recorder
      and Aldermen of the City for the mans Release assuring Captain Vandeput he was a peaceable
      disposed Citizen, I have ordered him to be set at Liberty, but an Ensign in the Connecticut
      Militia, likewise a Prisoner cin board the Asia, I have directed to be detained and carried to
      England; considering him as an Officer although of low rank, in Arms against his Sovereign. I
      send Copies of Captain <name>Vandeputs Letter</name> and the inclosure therein mentioned for your further
      Information. </P>
   <P>Captain Vandeput also writes in a Letter, dated October the 9, that so far from withholding
      provisions from the Ship in Consequence of his firing upon the Battery he had lately
      compleated to four months, and that they were regularly supplied with fresh Beef; That [Isaac]
      Sears has sold his house and removed his Effects to Connecticut, And that the Delegates and
      Rebel Officers, fearing to be seized, pass the River at a considerable distance from the Town.
      I inclose an Extra'ct from Captain <name>Vandeputs Letter</name> containing further Intelligence. </P>
   <P>When I sent the Transports to Captain Wallace, which returned with the Swan, I directed him to
      fill them with live Cattle, Hay, Wood, Vegetables &amp;c for the Fleet; to take those things
      by force from the Rebels, but to pay for them to Friends of Government. I have great pleasure
      in transmitting to you the inclosed account Captain Wallace has sent me of his Proceedings on
      this occasion as it does him Honour, and will I hope afford their Lordships very satisfactory
      Intelligence of our Situation at Rhode Island. </P>
   <P>A few Days since I sent two Transports to Halifax to be laden with essence of Spruce and Wood
      for the Fleet, and being well assured that after the Middle of November Halifax had nothing to
      apprehend from the Rebels until April next; I sent Orders for the Somerset to sail for
      Plymouth as soon as Commissioner Arbuthnot or any of his Majesty's Frigates arrived at
      Halifax. </P>
   <P>I have directed a Transport to take on board a proportion of Provisions sufficient to last the
      Rose, Glasgow, Swan and Bolton until the end of March next, with a Quantity of Stores of all
      kinds and Slops. I have com pleated the Swan, and shall send an account of the whole to
      Captain Wallace to be distributed as he shall think proper among his Majesty's Ships and
      Vessels under his Command. And I shall send this Transport under Convoy of the Swan, who is to
      remain at Rhode Island until I can relieve her with some of the Ships expected from England. </P>
   <P>I have not heard from Virginia or the Carolinas since my last Letters, but am in hourly
      expectation of the Tamer and Cruizers Arrival. It is reported Captain Tollemache has been at
      Bermudas with the Transport sent to bring the Ordnance from <name>Fort Johnson</name>, but as he sailed
      from hence the latter end of August I cannot think the Report is true, unless any Accident has
      befallen either of the Vessels.3 Iam&amp;c </P>

      to know their Intentions, not believing it was intended to destroy the place; but, when
      assured of it, returned on shore to apprise the Inhabitants, after assuring the Officers that
      he had taken no part in the Rebellion, that he had been offered a Command in the Provincial
      Troops, but would not accept it. </P>

   <P>The brigantine Minerva, an armed vessel in the service of this Colony, commanded lately Cap.

      important enterprize for the defence and safety of this Colony, and the hands on board having
      neglected and refused to obey said orders, said Cap. Hall and Lt. Phillips of said brig being
      notified were present to be enquired of in the premises; and being examined &amp;c., it
      appears that all the hands or soldiers and marines on board, except about 10 or 12, being duly
      noticed of said orders utterly declined and refused to obey the same and perform said cruise,
      which through their disobedience has wholly failed &amp;c.</P>
   <P>It is therefore considered and resolved by this Board, That all the said hands who were guilty
      of such disobedience be forthwith dismissed and discharged from the service of this Colony on
      board said brig, in manner and at the discretion of the committee hereafter appointed; and
      that their wages and title to receive any for former services on board the same be suspended

      aforesaid, and to direct, authorize and impower said Cap. Hall to inlist and retain other men
      so many as they shall think proper, instead of the men so discharged, for such term as shall
      by the General Assembly or the Governor and this Committee be judged necessary, and until

   <P>This morning between the hours of 1 and 2, as the guard at the treasurer's was just going to
      be relieved, they discovered some men coming up the bottom a little below the treasury office;
      upon which the guard repeatedly hailed them, but they refusing to reply, the former fired upon
      them, without doing any damage. The rascals almost immediately returned the fire, but also did
      no injury. We understand the villains have been industriously pursued, but without any
      effect.</P>
   <P>Last Tuesday afternoon [October 31] we were alarmed with a report that the pirates were
      cannonading Jamestown, an express having arrived in this city, informing us that he heard 9
      guns distinctly. A party of our men were immediately ordered out to go to that place for its
      defence, when they discovered two tenders, which, in the whole, fired about 26 swivels,
      without doing any other injury than striking the house (the ferry house) of Mr. Lester, with
      one ball only. </P>

   <P>By <name>His Excellency</name> <name>Patrick Tonyn</name> Esquire Captain General Governor and Commander in Chief in and
      over His Majestys said Province. Chancellor and Vice Admiral of the same -</P>
   <P>A Proclamation</P>
   <P>Whereas in the present unhappy and distressed Situation of great numbers of His Majestys Loyal
      and Faithful Subjects in several Provinces in North America grieveously oppressed and
      languishing under the Despotic Tyranny - of a few factious and designing Men, who have from
      private views by misrepresentation and falsehood imposed upon and engaged in an unnatural
      Rebellion many of His Majestys well disposed Subjects, and selecting themselves into sundry
      unlawfull Committees, have in a most insolent and daring manner suspended the execution of the
      Laws and the Authority of the Magistrate, and assuming to themselves the Reins of Government
      and an Authority over all Persons within the respective Provinces now in Rebellion, using not
      only abuse and threats, but inflicting actual and unprecedented punishments upon such as are
      firmly attached to their King and the Laws and Constitution of their Country or refuse to sign
      Seditious and treasonable Articles of Combination and submit to their usurped Authority - And
      Whereas His Majesty from His usual Attention to the Peace and safety of all His Subjects in
      whatever part of His extensive Dominions residing And from his wonted compassion for the
      distresses of others, has been most Graciously pleased to signify to me by the Right
      Honourable the Earl of Dartmouth His Royal intention, and wishes, to afford every possible
      protection to such of His Subjects in the Colonies in Rebellion, as shall be too weak to
      resist the violence of the times, and too Loyal to concur in the measures of those, who have
      avowed and supported this unnatural Rebellion, And that this Province may not only prove a
      secure Asylum to such but induce them to settle here. His Majesty has been further graciously
      pleased to suspend the execution of the Instructions of the 3d of February 1774 respecting the
      Sale of lands for the present, but also all other Reservations and Restrictions, and to
      authorise me for the encouragement of such Persons as may under these cruel Circumstances be
      induced to seek a happy Asylum in this Province, to make out for them gratuitous Grants of
      Land exempt from Quit Rents for Ten Years - I do therefore by and with the Advice and Consent
      of H1s Majestys Honble Council Issue this my Proclamation inviting all Persons suffering under
      the above Circumstances to come and reside in this His Majesty's Loyal Colony where they may
      unmolested follow their iawful occupations and enjoy the quiet possession of their Property,
      and the valuable blessing of that Liberty, which is an enemy to licentiousness; friendly to
      Government and consistent with the Laws of Great Britain And that upon application to me in
      Council they shall have Grants of Land as a Family Right under the usual restrictions and
      limitations, with an exemption from Quit Rents for Ten Years from the date of the Grant, and
      every possible protection and encouragement. </P>
   <P>And whereas many of His Majestys honest well meaning and loyal Subjects in these factious and
      Rebellious times, where falsehood for a while may prevail over truth and force and violence in
      part over just Authority may be greatly imposed upon by the malicious insinuations and false
      representations of His Majesty's disaffected Subjects. I have thought fit and do with the
      advice of His Majesty's Honble Council further encourage them to take up their Residence here,
      from the following considerations - Vizt </P>
   <P>That the Climate is healthy as many of the Spaniards formerly lived here to a comfortable old
      age, and as from the establishment of the Civil Government of this Colony under the Crown of
      Great Britain, His Majestys Subjects have enjoyed a state of good Health, which is
      particularly manifest from the Returns of His Majestys Troops in Garrison at St Augustine -
      that the Climate is sufficiently cold in Winter to brace up the constitution after the Summer
      Months which are refreshed by a regular Sea Breeze - that several kinds of Grain and
      Vegetables produced in Great Britain may be cultivated here with Success in Winter - Indian
      Corn, Rice, Indigo Cotton and Sugar Cane in Summer - that if it should be thought too
      expensive or the Seasons too precarious for raising Sugar and Rum for Exportation a Planter
      may at a Small expence and trouble raise Sugar Cane sufficient to supply his Family with both
      - that the Winter is not so severe as to destroy the West India Cotton, but that it grows up
      in great luxuriancy in the Spring - that the Climate and Soil seems peculiarly adapted for
      producing Indigo Weed from which the - Planters have made Indigo of a Quality superior to any
      made in the British Colonies in North America - that the Country is well pastured and fit for
      raising Cattle and Stock of every kind, without the assistance of artificial Grasses or laying
      up provender for Winter - that the Country is conveniently intersected with Rivers plentifully
      stored with variety of Fish, and fit for Navigation and for bringing down produce and Lumber
      to the respective Ports - that their Banks are covered with large Oaks, and other Timber fit
      for building Vessels that there is variety of other Timber for Staves and Lumber fit for the
      West India Market -</P>
   <P>And I do further by the Advice of His Majesty's Honble Council, and in obedience to His
      Majesty's Commands, hereby offer every Possible encouragement in my power for the exportation
      of Lumber to the West India Islands, and that I will upon application to me grant Licences to
      Cut Wood for Lumber upon any part of His Majesty's Lands upon sufficient security being given,
      to Land it in some Island belonging to His Majesty </P>

   <P>I have the pleasure to Acquaint you, the Garrison Surrendered last Night, this Morning we take
      possession, to Morrow I hope the Prisoners will set off, enclosed you have the Capitulation,
      which I hope will meet with your Approbation &amp; that of Congress I have ventured to permit
      an Officer or two to go to their Families, which are in some Distress at Montreal, upon their
      Parole - they can't do us any harm, &amp; there would have been a Degree of inhumanity in
      refusing them - When we had played on the Fort some Hours from our Battery of 4-12 pounders on
      the N: W: &amp; another of 2-12 pounders &amp; 2 four pounders on the East side - some
      prisoners arrived who had been taken in an Action with Governor Carleton at Longaiel, he made
      an Attempt to land with 34 Boats full of Men [Seth] Warner's Detachment consisting of the
      Green Mountain Boys and 2nd Regt of Yorksers repuls'd them with Loss - took 2 Indians and two
      Canadians prisoners - We have Buried 3 Indians and it is supposed many in the Boats must have
      been killed - we had not a Man even wounded - (this I believe is his last effort) One of the
      above mentioned prisoners I sent into the Fort to Inform Major [Charles] Preston of the
      Circumstances of the Action, that he might Judge what prospect he could have of relief - it
      had the desired effect - the Garrison having been on half allowance for some time. I am making
      the necessary preparations to proceed immediately to Montreal by way of La Prairie - as the
      Enemy have Armed Vessels in the Sorrell - Send every body you possibly can immediately down,
      as it is much to be Apprehended many of the Men in this Service will insist on returning home,
      when their times are expired - It will not be necessary fo keep people with arms for the
      present at Ticonderoga - Several Men of Rank in Canada are among the prisoners - I have
      permitted them to remain at Crown point till the return of two Gentlemen they send to their
      Friends for Money &amp;c: they pleaded hard to return home - but they are too dangerous to let
      loose again - I have this moment received your Letter of 27th Octobr - Not a word of Arnold
      yet - I have sent two Expresses to him lately - one by an Indian who promised to return with
      Expedition - The instant I have any News of him I will acquaint you by Express - Col: [James]
      Easton &amp; Majo'r [John] Brown with that Corps &amp; Mr Livingston with I believe 1000

   <Title>Purdie's <name>Virginia Gazette</name>, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1775 </Title>
   <P>Williamsburg, November 3.</P>
   <P>The rifle-men and soldiers of Hampton desire their compliments to capt. Squire and his
      squadron, and wish to know how they approve the reception they met with last friday [October
      27]. Should he incline to renew his visit, they will be glad to see him; otherwise, in point
      of complaisance, they will be under the necessity of returning the visit. If he cannot find
      the ear that was cut of[f], they hope he will wear a wig to hide the mark; for perhaps it may
      not be necessary that all should know chance had effected that which the laws ought to have
      done.</P>
   <P>It is certainly a fact, that in the late engagement at Hampton a rifle-man killed a man at the
      distance of 400 yards. Take care, ministerial troops.</P>
   <P>The seven white prisoners taken on board the Hawke tender at Hampton had been treated with
      great humanity, one of them admitted to his parole, and another discharged; but the negro
      slaves are doubly confined, and will be tried for their lives.</P>
   <P>A small squadron (commanded, it is said, by capt. Montague) a few days since exchanged some
      shot with a party of riflemen at Jamestown, without any effect. The frequent depredations
      committed on the rivers by the tenders have provoked the inhabitants in every part to await
      their people coming on shore, when they expect to treat them with that riguor due to thieves
      and robbers. </P>
   <P>Between 1 and 2 o'clock last wednesday morning [November 1], it being very dark and. rainy,
      the sentinel on duty at the treasury fired upon some persons, whom he had repeatedly
      challenged without receiving any answer; and suspecting they were armed, and that they might
      return, he hung his blanket upon some pales, and stood with his gun ready cocked to fire at
      the flash of their guns. In about half an hour a gun was discharged from behind the treasury,
      the ball from which struck close to the blanket, and the sentinel fired a second time. The
      captain of the guard at the magazine, hearing the report of guns, went immediately with a
      small detachment to endeavour to intercept the villains upon their retreat, and it is said saw
      three men at whom he fired, without success, it being exceedingly dark. Next morning several
      parties were sent after them, but could gain no other intelligence than that two or three men,
      in blue jackets, had been seen early that morning, near the creek, by some negroes. </P>
   <P>It has been suspected that capt. Montague himself was the person, and that his design was to
      attempt to destroy the magazine or treasury; and that his madness and folly made him return
      the sentinal's fire. Whoever he was, he had a narrow escape. </P>

   <P>Mr. President reported the draught of an answer, which he had been desired to prepare, to
      Capt. Thornbrough's letter of the 1st instant.</P>
   <P>And the said draught being taken into immediate consideration, was amended, and agreed to:</P>
   <P>In Congress. <name>Charles Town</name>, South-Carolina, Nov. 3, 1775.</P>
   <P>To <name>Edward Thornbrough</name>, Commander of the Tamer Sloop of War.</P>
   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Col. [Henry] Laurens, the late President, yesterday laid before us, your letter of the first
      instant. Before we make any answer to it, we must intimate to you, that as, by your verbal
      answer to a public messenger, who carried you a letter dated 28th ult. from Col. Laurens, as
      President, you promised a written answer to that letter, relative to an information received,
      that a run-away negro, the property of <name>John-Allen Walter</name>, Esq; was harboured on board the
      sloop of war under your command - so your unexpected silence on this head, at once is a breach
      of the rules of propriety, and a negative confession, that the negro, if not on board the
      Tamer, is actually harboured on board the Cherokee, the residence of Lord <name>William Campbell</name>, or
      some other vessel under your command.</P>
   <P>The public, Sir, are too well acquainted with the arbitrary and irritating style peculiar to
      Lord <name>William Campbell</name>'s Secretary, for us to have the least room to imagine, that you are the
      framer of the letter you sent to Col. Laurens, dated 1st instant. However, we cannot but
      declare, that we know of no &quot;unprovoked insults&quot; the King's servants have received
      from any assembly by authority of the people; and we wish we could say, that the conduct of
      the King's principal servant hath not made him an object of the just resentment of the public.
      Having declared these things, it may not be improper that we just hint to you, that we are not
      destitute of means enabling us to take vengeance, for any violence you may think proper to
      perpetrate against the shipping bound to, or out from this port. </P>
   <P>You ought, Sir, for very obvious reasons, to have been well assured, that Walker, the late
      gunner, is a prisoner at the barracks, before you, in absolute terms, declared, that he is
      &quot;now a prisoner&quot; there, and threatened to detain a coasting vessel until he should
      be thence discharged and sent on board the Tamer. We declare, that Walker is not in
      confinement at the barracks, and has not been in confinement there, since his discharge from
      thence on his parole several weeks ago. We do not know where he is: But, from the strictest
      enquiry we have been able to make, we have no reason to think he is within this colony. On the
      contrary, we learn, that Lord <name>William Campbell</name> dispatched him (and that you are privy to his
      departure) to St. Augustine, with a letter, as Walker himself has declared, to desire that a
      military force might be sent against the good people of this colony. Walker was landed at
      Savannah, and we have not heard of him since. </P>
   <P>By the last sentence in your letter, we find you have been deceived into a belief, that Lord
      <name>William Campbell</name> shewed great humanity to Capt. [John] Wanton of Rhode-Island, who
      unfortunately fell into his hands, and that it was, bona fide, Capt. Wanton's interest to
      employ Walker, on board his vessel. We have strictly inquired of Captain Wanton touching these
      points, and from this examination we are able to say, that if Lord <name>William Campbell</name>'s
      declaration to Captain Wanton that his vessel was seized under a late act of parliament; and
      his sending the Captain, his crew and vessel to proceed to St. Augustine, under an armed force
      on board, in order there to be condemned, are acts of humanity; it was certainly
      &quot;ungrateful&quot; in the Captain and crew, on the passage, to overpower the armed force,
      and to rescue the vessel from an arbitrary seizure: But as Walker was, by Lord William
      Campbell, armed, and contrary to the interest of Captain Wanton, put on board his vessel to
      command, and to conduct her to St. Augustine, and for the purpose of condemnation too, we
      cannot understand, that in the execution of such a business, he was in the service of Captain
      Wanton; or that Captain Wanton was guilty of any impropriety in getting rid of him as soon as
      he could by landing him at Savannah. </P>
   <P>These things, Sir, having the greatest appearance of being facts, the most positive
      declarations to the contrary, short of absolute proof, from on board the Cherokee, will not
      alter our determination, or the opinion of the public on those points. </P>
   <P>By order of the Congress. </P>
   <P>[<name>William Henry Drayton</name>, President.] </P>
   <P>Ordered, That the said letter be immediately ingrossed; and that Mr. President do sign the
      same, and send it, by the messenger, to Captain Thornbrough. </P>

      have given orders to form two more in the Neighbourhood of Chignecto of Accadians, also, and
      one Company of the Inhabitants of this Town under the name of light Infantry, and as the House
      of Assembly (who have now under Consideration the ways and means of raising money for the
      defence ofthe Province) shall enable me to support and maintain the Militia. I shall endeavour
      to form as many Companies as the Province will afford, but I am of opinion, that through the
      poverty of the Country the want of Specie among them, the great Burthen of their Debts, the
      levies of money which will be slow, and ineffectual to answer the purpose, and if matters
      should be brought to Extreme necessity, I shall be obligd to draw on the Treasury at Home for
      discharging the immediately necessary expence. I shall be extreme carefull on this head, as
      nothing shall induce me to such measures but the necessity there wil be of preserving this
      Colony, from whence His Majesty's Army and Navy has at present their supplies of Wood, Timber,
      Sundries, Picketts Fresh Provisions &amp;ca. and cannot otherwise be supplied.</P>
   <P>I have sent expresses to <name>St Johns</name> River, to endeavour to engage the Indians of this Province
      on the part of the Crown, shoud it succeed it will be attended with some expence, and as there
      is no fund established for such exigency's, I shall be necessitated to draw for the same.
      unless this measure be adopted, as the Americans are trying every means to gain them over to
      their party, we shall not only lose the benefit of them for our own defence, but shoud they
      gain them to take up Arms against us, they woud be more formidable to the settlers here than
      an Army of Americans.</P>
   <P>I cannot but observe to your Lordship, that tho' I have ever since the Rebels have meditated
      this design, press'd General Gage to reinforce this Colony under these alarming Circumstances,
      I coud procure no relief; till within these few days, two Companies of the 14th are arrived,
      and about seventy of the Royal Fencible Americans and by a Return from Colonel [Joseph] Gorham
      of the State of the Troops here at present, tho the whole number consist of 390: no more than
      126 are return'd fit for duty -</P>
   <P>The Engineer Captain [William] Spry is now employ'd in preparing some Temporary works for the
      Security of the Yard, and I am of opinion if this disturbance in America continues, it will be
      a necessary measure to erect some Fortifications for the security of the Town, as it will then
      serve as an arsenal of Stores for the Army and Navy in America. </P>
   <P>I beg leave to inclose to your Lordship my Speech to the General Assembly, and their Address
      to me, and as soon as they shall have finish'd the business before them shall transmit the
      Laws &amp; proceedings relative thereto. </P>
   <P>I have also inclosd to your Lordship an Address from both Houses, relative to the impressing
      of Seamen, this has been of disadvantage to the Trade, and if an Indulgence coud be permitted
      it woud tend greatly to the benefit of the Trade &amp; West India Islands. I have the honor to
      be with the greatest Respect <name>My Lord</name> [&amp;c.]</P>

   <Title>REV. <name>SAMUEL DEANE</name> TO BENJAMIN GREENLEAF 1</Title>
   <P>Sir: -</P>
   <P>Falmouth, 4th Novr 1775</P>
   <P>Our affairs in this town are got into such confusion that I am tempted to go out of my line
      and I know not what member of the General Court I can apply to better than yourself. Such is
      our present dismal situation that unless something is done for us more than we can do for
      ourselves, we are absolutely undone, and shall too probably, if the war continues six months
      longer, involve the whole province of Main in our ruin.</P>
   <P>What we call the neck is thought by the best Judges Easy to fortify against the land, and not
      very difficult against the sea. Our harbour is one of the best in the province: perhaps the
      best of all: it is capacious, accessible &amp; never is froze up. About 2 thirds of the
      buildings in general, the best, have been laid in ashes by Mowat. He could not have done it if
      the 60 men in the province pay stationed here had been properly commanded. The company is by
      your honorable court put under the direction of a committee. The committee were so employed in
      gettg out their families and effects that they did not assemble to give orders. Individuals of
      the Committee gave contrary directions to the captain: so that all the opposition made to the
      landg of men with torches durg the cannonade was by volunteers, without any leader or
      direction. Last Wednesday [November 1] the Cerberus arrived in our harbour, a hellish name,
      with an infernal commander, yclep'd <name>John Symons</name>. He returned a letter to the Town, declarg
      that if the Town or Country adjacent should raise any armed men, abuse the Kings officers, or
      other peaceably disposed subject, erect military works &amp;c. it would be his indispensable
      duty to proceed with the most rigorous efforts against the Town. The Militia is call'd in, and
      they with part of the soldiery, are gog to throw up some breast works this night, so that we
      expect a cannonade at least to-morrow morng We have cannon that would be able to annoy the
      ship much if we had ammunition: But we have not half enough for our small arms. Symons has
      asked for a few cattle and offer'd pay for them and has been refused. </P>
   <P>After this detail of particulars, which I know to be true, I leave it to yourself to say
      whether it is not probable that our enemies will not be disposed to take possession of our
      neck and fortify it: whether they will not make it a place of rendevous for some of their
      ships this winter: whether in stead of a Committee it is not the indispensable duty of the
      General Court to send us some able and experienced officer to be at the head of our companies
      that are in pay: Whether we out [ought] not to be visited at least by some skilful Engineer,
      who can shew us what to do, and what we ought not to do: whether it is not necessary to have
      more men raised here. I think the present number, scattered along the shore of the county
      mostly in places where they are not at all wanted is 200. </P>
   <P>The Town has petition'd Gen. Washington for troops. He has answered that he has no authority
      to send any. If some were sent, bread must be sent with them: for it is an article that this
      country could not supply them with. I conjure you Sr by your Zeal for the publick welfare to
      take our forlorn state into your serious consideration, and be a strenuous advocate for us at
      the honble Board, and with the members of the house, as you have opportunity. If any of my
      hints arc good, I am confident you will improve them; if you think anythg better I shall be
      glad to have them drop into oblivion. But unless you or some other of the Gen: Court shall
      cause some thg to be done for us I think it probable that in half a year the inhabitants of
      the County will be either prisoners, or else be driven so far back into the woods that they
      cannot subsist. </P>
   <P>Another affair I would also intreat you to take into consideration. I mean the lamentable
      state of the poor of Falmouth, who have lost their habitations; many of their movables, their
      whole employment: and are now livg upon the charity of those whom they will soon reduce to a
      level with themselves, and all, as far as I can divine must before Spring starve together. We
      have had a messenger at your court, and some of the members give him encouragement: others
      fling toryisms at us, and seem disposed that we shd suffer till we are brought to reason. But
      Sr is starvg the way to convert Tories? If so the mercantile part of them will be converted
      first, as yy [they] are in general the greatest sufferers: But I fancy they will be the
      hardest to convert of any. Suppose this Town has not been so forward as they ought in the
      common cause: ought the province therefore to withhold Christian charity? If thine enemy
      hunger thou shalt feed him. But the poor have not been wanting in the cause of liberty: and is
      it right that they should suffer for the aims of their superiours? I believe Charlestown has
      been as faulty as Falmouth; and I have heard the province has reliev'd its poor. I hope the
      province is not weary of extendg charity to their destroyed Towns. I think there will not be
      many more sea port towns destroy'd, unless our enemies should increase amazingly. </P>
   <P>It is possible for me at present to tell the number of families that must have charity
      extended to them to keep them alive till Spring: or rather till they can raise something out
      of the ground next Summer. I should guess they are the bigger part of a hundred families. Some
      of the ablest towns in this and York Counties might take them and feed them for the present if
      the Court shall so order. If our destruction had happened in the Spring, the distress of the
      poor would not have been comparatively anything. </P>
   <P>Relying much upon your wisdom and humanity, I am, dear Sr [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>P.S. Nov 5. The Ship is gone: It is supposed to bring assistance, either to take possession of
      the neck or to destroy the remainder of the Town. </P>

   <P>I am extremely concerned that the Sloop Phoenix Dean Master,2 mentioned in your Letter to me
      Sepr 22d, is not yet condemned, what the Reasons are I know not, but there is the most
      unaccountable Reluctance to condemn Vessels evidently guilty of Breaches of the restraining
      Acts; And now the Judge begins to doubt the competency of his own Jurisdiction, when he knows
      there is no other part of the Continent except Halifax where any of the Kings Courts can be
      held. A very fine Schooner with Gin on board and other prohibited Articles taken in or near
      the Delaware has been a month in the Admiralty Court for Condemnation, and the Cause at last
      thrown out for the Reasons above mentioned. You may depend that if the Phoenix is not
      condemned I will seize her for the Kings Use on your Report. I am &amp;c.</P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 4 Novr 1775.</P>
   <P>The Account you have sent me of your proceedings with his Majesty's Ships and Vessels under
      your Command at Newport and Bristol in your Letter October 14 meets my full Approbation.</P>
   <P>People so abominably hardened in the most ungrateful Rebellion against their Parent State
      deserve no favor, every Indulgence already shewn them, instead of procuring suitable Returns
      of dutiful Obedience to his Majesty and Submission to the Laws, has only encouraged them to
      commit farther Violences, therefore they must now expect to be severely dealt with.</P>
   <P>I believe the day after the Viper sailed the Raven brought me the long wished for Orders,
      which, as I expected, ought to have been here two months sooner.</P>
   <P>These have occasioned me to determine the old Code and instead thereof to issue another with
      additioqal Orders better adapted to the times. You receive a Set of each for the Rose,
      Glasgow, and Bolton. The Viper's are delivered to her Captain. It therefore only remains for
      us to make the most of our time before the severe Weather sets in, by harrassing and
      destroying the Rebels and their Property, where the latter cannot be brought off to compel
      them to submit.</P>
   <P>Altho' the Swan is not in a fit condition to be much longer on Service without being hove
      down, yet her Captain being so well acquainted determines me to send her back to you again
      until I can relieve her with either a good Sloop or Frigate; and indeed for other Reasons, To
      strengthen your Force and to convoy a Transport to you with Stores; Slops and Provisions, of
      which I shall write particularly in another Letter. </P>
   <P>The Rebels of the Continent must not be allowed to fortify themselves on Rhode Island, or to
      remain there if you can by any means hinder it. And whatever Resentment the Inhabitants may
      apprehend from the whole Continent, their not assisting to drive out the Rebels will
      inevitably bring upon them the destruction of the Town of Newport by the King's Ships, which I
      fancy in its Consequences will be more prejudicial to them than any punishment of the
      Congress. It will therefore be a very wise part in the Inhabitants of Rhode Island to avert
      the imgending blow by instantly declaring themselves to be on the Side of Government and by
      heartily uniting with you to repel the common Enemy. </P>
   <P>As you must be the best Judge how far it is practicable with your present force to carry on
      any operations against the Rebels in the Colony of Connecticut, I will not pretend to direct.
      The preserving Rhode Island is an Object that in my Opinion all other Considerations must
      yield to, I will therefore only express my earnest Desire that you will scourge the Rebels
      whenever Opportunity presents itself; Constantly remembering to distinguish, as you have
      hitherto done, the well affected to the King and Sufferers in his Cause from those who
      violently and wickedly are attempting to overturn the Constitution I am &amp;c. </P>

      Transport, <name>Isaac <name>Robinson Master</name></name>, intended for his Majesty's Ships Rose and Glasgow but to be
      distributed according to your Orders and the Necessities of the Ships with you.</P>
   <P>Inclosed is also an Account containing the Numbers and Contents and Quantities of Provisions
      sent also for your Ships together with a Parcel of Stores, the whole to be supplied by your
      Order, and for which you are to be very careful to cause regular and proper Receipts to be
      given: For the Provisions Tripiclates in the names of the Masters of the Transports from
      whence each Species was taken; and for the Slops and Stores, to Mr <name>William Fowler</name> his
      Majesty's Naval Officer at Boston, by the respective Officers who shall receive the same.</P>
   <P>You have also an Account of what Stores and Slops have been supplied, particularly to the
      Swan, in Order that you may be fully informed of the State of your Ships with respect to the
      Stores, Slops and Provisions, as we may not be able to send you any more before the
      Spring.</P>
   <P>I would have you clear the Transport as soon as possible, and load her with Hay and Wood, but
      as much of the former as can be got, for we have live Cattle but no Fodder, and are daily
      expecting to receive more Stock without a Prospect of their subsisting. </P>
   <P>Government has contracted with Mr <name>Robert Grant</name> for his Agents here to furnish fresh Beef upon
      Commission, so that the Crown defraying the whole Expence attending the supplying it to the
      Ships, Cattle are buying in all Places and generally arrive at Boston with only a few days
      Hay, where that Article is not to be had. Mr [Alexander] Brymer the Contractors Agent here has
      given Mr <name>Robinson Master</name> of the Transport Orders to buy what he can get, the uncertainty of
      the Situation of things at Rhode Island preventing his writing to any other Person; As I am
      sure without your Assistance he will return empty, I desire you will endeavour to get the
      Transport laden with as much Dispatch as possible and send her round under Convoy. </P>
   <P>If unfortunately you cannot fill the Transport with Hay, you will order such Boatswains and
      Carpenters Stores to be returned in her as are cumbersome and useless on board, directing
      proper Accounts of each to be sent to the Storekeeper who will return the necessary Receipts.

   <P>Philadelphia, the 4th of November, 1775.</P>
   <P>Gentlemen of the Committee I sincerely sympathize with you in your distress, and from the
      inhuman proceedings of those tyrants that infest America, I am afraid your valuable town of
      New-York is in danger of being burnt. I would therefore recommend to you to prepare
      fire-vessels, which properly made use of, will defend you against your infernal enemies, and
      save your town, which is valuable. I am of opinion I am possessed of a knowledge that would be
      efficacious in burning such vessels as may come to do you damage, but as my situation requires
      me to conceal my name at present, it would not be prudent it should yet be known, as it may be
      attended with ill consequences to me; neither would it be prudent to risk my advice without an
      advantage in proportion to the service I may do. Should you, therefore, gentlemen, conceive
      the above proposal to be of any importance, and deserving of an answer, be pleased to direct
      to A, at the London Coffee-House, !o the care of Mr. <name>Hugh James</name>, the barkeeper. I am,

   <P>We deferred an answer to your Honor's last letter hoping to have obtained the Resolves of
      Congress upon the Interesting Subjects contained in it. We laid it before Congress. Business
      has since been very pressing, but we shall embrace the first favorable opportunity of
      obtaining the proper Resolves &amp; shall transmit them as soon as possible. 2</P>
   <P>We have no news from England since the arrival of the Ship which brought the Pro'c[lamatio]n
      for suppressing Rebellion and Sedition We have the pleasure to assure you Sir that this has a
      most happy Effect upon the affairs of America. Gentlemen no longer expect a Redress of
      Grievances from Petition, etc. They now speak out plainly and cheerfully enter into the most
      liberal spirited and decisive measures. We congratulate you Sir upon the happy Reduction of
      <name>Fort Chamblee</name>. The Paper containing the Articles of Capitulation, List of Stores, etc., we
      have enclosed. There is no doubt but we have possession of <name>St John</name>'s before this time.</P>
   <P>The Congress has taken into consideration the state of the trade of the United Colonies. We
      enclose you an Extract of their Proceedings. 3 We are sensible of the vast Importance of Trade
      to our Colony but when we consider the invaluable privileges for which we are contending, We
      are sure that the Virtue of our Constitution [Constituents] will with pleasure sacrifice a
      temporary Commerce to the salvation of their Country. </P>
   <P>The moment that our Ports can be opened with a Prospect of Success to the Merchts and with
      safety to the Liberating of America we shall use our utmost Influence to restore to the Colony
      all the Benefits of a free and extensive Commerce. We are with great Regards, [&amp;c.] </P>

      Voyage; I hope the Vessel is gone for Winter approaches fast &amp; it is of the last

   <P>Last Wednesday afternoon [November 1] two tenders came up James river, and fired a

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Tamer, Rebellion Road, Nov. 4th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Without the aid of any secretary, armed as I am with truth, I can enter the lists even with
      Mr. <name>William Henry Drayton</name>, when his weapons are sophistry, falsehood, and the grossest
      misrepresentation.</P>
   <P>On after consideration, I did not think Mr. Laurens' letter worthy a written answer, as I
      never directly or indirectly harboured the run-away slave of any person; and I will answer for
      the gentleman who commands the Cherokee, that his conduct has been exactly similar to mine in
      these matters. It is not my business to enter into any detail of the treatment, the King's
      Representatives and the other servants of government have met with, from those assemblies
      which you have dignified with the name of the public; but, I have prevailed on his Excellency
      to favour me with an extract of his letter to Governor Tonyn at St. Augustine, which I now
      enclose; as it will enable the people of this Province, to form a judgment of Captain Wanton's
      worth and gratitude, as well as of your candour and veracity. As I have some reason to think
      the original is in your custody, or in that of your emissaries, you will hardly dispute its
      authenticity.</P>
   <P>But, to the main purport of my letter, while I command the King's ships here, I will procure
      provisions by every means in my power; if the methods I am under a necessity of taking for
      that purpose, should subject his Majesty's faithful and loyal people in this Province to any
      inconveniency, I shall be extremely sorry; but, they are to impute it entirely to those who
      have plunged this late unhappy country into misery and distress, and not to me, who have
      always protected it to the utmost of my power.</P>
   <P>I am to acknowledge Walker was not your prisoner on the late occasion - he is returned; in
      that point, I was misinformed. I shall only add, that I am here determined to drop this
      correspondence; which, is a very disagreeable one to me: and, I shall only expect a speedy and
      explicit answer. I am, Sir, [&amp;c.] </P>
   <P><name>Edward Thornbrough</name>. </P>
   <P>[Enclosure] </P>
   <P>Extract of a Letter from <name>His Excellency</name> the Right Hon. Lord <name>William Campbell</name>, to Governor
      Tonyn, of St. Augustine. </P>
   <P>---- The bearer of this, is a man who says he was bound from Newport in Rhode-Island, to
      Nantucket, in a small sloop which he had freighted but in a hard gale of wind was drove to the
      southward, without either chart or quadrant, and with only two landsmen and a boy on board; by
      a kind </P>
   <P>,/ </P>
   <P>of miracle he made this harbour yesterday, and pushed in at a venture. The poor man's dreadful
      situation fully proved the truth of his story, although he had no clearance from Newport; and
      the unfeigned joy he expressed when he found himself in safety, left no doubt of the reality
      of the distresses he has suffered. </P>
   <P>By the late acts of parliament, he might be considered as a legal prize; but Captain
      Thornbrough of the Tamer, and Mr. Fergusson (who commands the Cherokee) had too much humanity
      to think of that, though we were all a good deal difficulted what to do with him. Return he
      could not and it would have been highly improper, as well as impolitic, to have suffered him
      to go to Charlestown, in the present situation of affairs there; as he had been only nine days
      from Newport, and not above a month ago, was in the rebel's camp near Boston. I therefore
      proposed sending him to St. Augustine, which Captains Thornbrough and Fergusson readily agreed
      to; at the same time generously offering to supply his little wants; and the man most
      cheerfully and with great thankfulness acquiesced This arrangement gave me the more
      satisfaction, as it enabled me to furnish your Excellency with many particulars you will be
      anxious to know, of the state of affairs to the northward by means of this Skipper; who you
      will find sensible and intelligent: his cargo consists of cider, apples, and cheese; and I
      shall be happy if it proves a seasonable supply of those articles to your Province, at this
      juncture. Captain [Alexander] Innis has given him a f cw lines to a friend of his in the
      mercantile way, to assist him in making the most of it, and procuring some employment for his
      bark till the summer; before which time he cannot venture to return home. To assist in
      navigating this vessel, and at the same time to prevent any attempt to run her into any of the
      little harbours on this coast, I have directed the gunner of <name>Fort Johnson</name>, one Walker, an old
      seaman, and a poor man who has been cruelly treated by the Charlestown people, to go in her to
      [St.] Augustine; and your Excellency will be so obliging as to send him back by the first
      opportunity. </P>

   <P>Captain [Samuel] Graves of the Viper arrived here the day before Yesterday, and delivered me
      your Letter October 25th I much approve your not accepting the profferred Conditions of the
      Ferry Boats passing upon the continental Rebels removing at a distance from the Town of
      Newport. Nothing but absolutely evacuating the Island ought to be accepted, if we are in a
      situation to command those Terms.</P>
   <P>You will ensure so much praise to yourself and Honor to the Corps in which you serve by
      obliging the Rebels to leave Rhode Island that I need not use any Arguments to enforce the
      necessity of such a measure, but perhaps your influence may exte[nd] much further, and by
      Persuasion or Force oblige the Rhode Islanders in spite of Prejudice to return to their Duty
      and become good and faithful Subjects; an Event which would afford me the highest
      Satisfaction.</P>
   <P>I shall send the, Viper back again to New York, where I am determined the Asia shall winter if
      a large Ship does not come to relieve her. I am told she can lie near the Wharfs out of the
      Tide, and yet sufficiently distant from them to make Boats necessary to have Communication
      with the Town. I am also informed she will not be frozen up. If they attempt anything against
      her during the Winter, I will assuredly lay their Town in Ashes the moment a Fleet can get up,
      of which I shall order Captain Vandeput to inform the Inhabitants. I have nothing more at
      present to add but to wish you all possible Success against the Rebels, whom I hope you will
      not spare when they can be attacked with any prospect of Advantage. I am &amp;c.</P>

   <P>As Vessels will pass up and down the River leading to Providence in spite of the utmost
      Vigilance, I wish to have its Channel stopped up. And if some old Vessels, that are clearly
      Rebel Property, could be filled with large Stones and sunk in the narrowest Parts 'it might
      destroy the Navigation of the River and thereby relieve the Ships from watching it so closely
      as now they are obliged to do; therefore if you ,think it practicable and can by any means
      accomplish this business which will be of great Benefit to the Kings Service, I desire you
      will endeavor to do it. Captain Vandeput acquaints me that he sent you intelligence of a
      Quantity of dry Goods and Cloathing buying up in New York to be sent through the Sound to New
      London to supply the Rebel Army. Today General Howe informed me that a Mr ---- of New York is
      busily employed there in making Cloathing for the Rebels, which is to go from thence by Water
      to Norwich in Connecticut. As it is of the utmost conseq[uence] to intercept those Vessels, I
      hope you have made a disposition of your Ships accordingly, and that by your Vigilance the
      Rebel Army, remaining without Cloathing, will not be able to keep the Field this Winter. I am

      this Province; by which they will see the necessity there is of immediately settling those
      matters Mr. Bedlow laid before them when he was in New-York last. We have had some evil
      persons already amongst us, who have instilled into the minds of the people at work here, that
      there is no security for their pay. This has given us a deal of trouble, with a set of people,
      whose tempers and dispositions are as various as their faces, to convince to the contrary. All
      our influence can not get them to work on Sundays. An order from the Honourable Board, on this
      head, will have great weight, to be made public here. Some of the artificers who were employed
      by the master workman, have had the assurance to say they were not to be directed by the
      commissioners, but by their own master workman. The advanced season of the year and necessity
      of forwarding the works, is a reason why we did not immediately disband them from the work. We
      are, sir, with esteem [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Dear sir</P>
   <P>Philadelphia November 5. 1775</P>
   <P>I am under Such Restrictions, Injunctions and Engagements of Secrecy respecting every Thing
      which passes in Congress, that I cannot communicate my own Thoughts freely to my Friends, So
      far as is necessary to ask their Advice, and opinions concerning Questions which many of them
      under stand much better than I do. This however is an in convenience, which must be Submitted
      to for the sake of Superiour Advantages -</P>
   <P>But I must take the Liberty to say that I think we shall soon think of maritime affairs, and
      naval Preparations: No great Things are to be exp[ected] at first, but out of a little a great
      deal may grow.</P>
   <P>It is very odd that, I, who have Spent my Days in [Enterprises]. and Employments so very
      different, and who have never thought much of old Ocean, or the Dominion of it, should be
      necessitated to make. such Enquiries: But it is my fate and my Duty, and therefore I must
      attempt it -</P>
   <P>I am to enquire what Number of seamen may be found in our Province who would probably in list
      in the service, either as Marines, or on board of Armed Vessells, in the Pay of the Continent,
      or in the Pay of the Province, or on board of Privateers, fitted out by Private Adventurers
      -</P>
   <P>I must also in treat you to let me know the Names Places of Abode, and Characters, of such
      Persons belonging to any of the seaport Towns in our Province, who are qualified for Officers
      and Commanders of Armed Vessells.</P>
   <P>I want to be further instructed, what ships, Brigantines schooners &amp;c are to be found in
      any Part of the Province, which are to be sold or hired out, which will be suitable for armed
      Vessells - What Their Tonnage the Depth of Water they draw, their Breadth, their Decks &amp;c,
      and to whom they belong. and what is their Age. </P>
   <P>Further, what Places in our Province, are most secure and best accomodated for Building new
      Vessells, of Force in Case a Measure of that Kind Should be thought of-</P>
   <P>The Committee have returned, much pleased with what they have seen and heard, which shews that
      their Embassy will be productive of happy Effects - They say the only disagreable
      Circumstance, was that their Engagements Haste and constant Attention to Business was such as
      prevented them from forming such Acquaintances with the Gentlemen of our Province as they
      wished But as Congress was waiting for their Return before they,could determine upon Affairs
      of the last Moment, they had not Time to spare. </P>
   <P>They are pretty well convinced I believe of several important Points, which they and others
      doubted before. </P>
   <P>New Hampshire has leave to Assume a Government and so has south Carolina, but this must not be
      freely talked of as yet, at least from me </P>
   <P>New England will now be able to exert her strength which a little Time Will shew to be greater
      than. either Great Britain or America imagines. - I give you Joy of the agreable Prospect in
      Canada. We have the Colours of the seventh Regiment as the first fruits of Victory. </P>

   <P>Dear Sir,-</P>
   <P>The Committee have returned, and I think well pleased with their Reception as well as with
      what they saw and heard. Impressions, have been made upon them either by the New England
      Gentlemen, or at Head Quarters, much to the Advantage of our Cause I assure you. Their Return
      has contributed much to Harmony and Unanimity, in all smaller Matters. in the great material
      Questions there was enough of them before. . . . 2</P>
   <P>I want to know what is become of the Whalemen, Codfishers, and other Seamen belonging to our
      Province, and what Number of them you imagine m,ight be inlisted into the service of the
      Continent, or of the Province, or of private Adventurers in Case a Taste for Privateering and
      a maritime Warfare should prevail, whether you think that two or three Battalions of Marines
      could be easily inlisted in our Province.</P>
   <P>What Ships, Brigantines, Schooners, suitable for armed Vessells might be purchased or hired,
      and at what Price in our Province, what their Burthen, Depth of Water, Length of Keel,
      Breadth, hight between Decks, Age, etc. and to whom they belong?</P>
   <P>What Places are most suitable, that is safest and best accomoaated, for building new Vessells,
      if any should be wanted; and what shipwrights may be had, and in what Time Vessells
      compleated?</P>
   <P>But above all, what Persons, their Names, Ages, Places of Abode and Characters, may be found
      in our Province who might be qualified to serve as Commanders and Officers, etc. </P>
   <P>These are necessary Enquiries, and I am very ill qualified to make them, yet to tell you a
      secret in Confidence, it has become my Duty. 3 There is a Disposition prevailing to spare no
      Pains or Expence, in the necessary Defence of our Rights by sea or Land. </P>

   <P>The Provincial Council of this province have ordered me to inform you, that the Regiments
      ordered to be raised on the Continental Establishment in this province are nearly compleat,
      yet they find insuperable difficulties in all their Attempts to procure Arms and Ammunition to
      render the Troops usefull in case of an emergency; That, no other probable expedient occurring
      by which these necessary Articles could be obtained, they have ordered their Vessells, one in
      each of the Ports of Edenton, New Bern and Cape Fear, to be loaded with such Commodities as
      would be most likely to answer, at the expence and Risque of this Province, and to be sent to
      some of the foreign Islands in the West Indias to endeavour to procure a quantity of Arms
      &amp; Ammunition for the use of the Province, this matter was ordered to be transacted with
      the strictest Secrecy and to be communicated to you under the strongest Injunctions not to
      reveal it unless it should be necessary in order to disclose the motives of the Council in
      justification of their Conduct to the Continental Congress.</P>
   <P>I have it likewise in charge to request that you will endeavour to purchase any quantity of
      small Arms &amp; Ammunition to be had in Philadelphia on the best Terms you can for the use of
      this Province and procure a, Conveyance by Land to such part of the province as you may judge
      most convenient and they will order a draft for the amount of the Purchase and expence of
      Transportation on the Continental Treasury. I am [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Dear Sir</P>
   <P>Edenton 5th November 1775</P>
   <P>Inclosed you will receive a Letter which is wrote by order of the Provincial Council, which
      met at Johnston Court-House the 17th of last month, the Absurdity of having two Regiments of
      men in pay without a possibility of their being of any Service for want of Arms and Ammunition
      was too striking to escape the observation of any one several Schemes were proposed to remedy
      this inconvenience, as the least exceptionable, that mentioned in the enclosed Letter was
      adopted, tho in my opinion wholly inadequate to the purpose as I have no doubt the men will be
      disbanded before there can be any returns, and as from the begining I was per£ ectly convinced
      of the impropriety of raising the Troops so now I am well satisfied that they will answer
      every purpose of those who were the most sanguine for the Measure equally well without Arms as
      with them I could therefore have wished that the general Association had not been infringed
      without a real necessity; but the general sense of the Council was for the measure and I was
      in no condition at that time to wrangle, being too heavily affiicted with Apprehensions for
      the safety of my own dearest connections and which the event proves to have been too well
      founded, to feel so sensibly for the honour of the province as I should have otherwise done
      -</P>
   <P>One Blunder is always productive of others the raising men without discovering they would be
      useless without arms &amp; ammunition has in order to remedy that mischief induced a Necessity
      of breaking thro the Association, what mischiefs may arise from this last Manoeuver time will
      discover, I am sure no good can come of it. </P>
   <P>I hear Lord Dunmore is at Logger heads with the Virginians; should our Governor have a small
      supply of men, the poor unarmed Men stationed below Wilmington will be in a piteous taking
      unless supported by the Militia which from the present temper of the inhabitants there is very
      little reason to expect. </P>
   <P>I heard yesterday that Lord Dunmore had stationed a tender at Oc[r]acock and that she had
      already taken two vessells laden with Salt, one of them supposed . to be <name>B. Baker</name>'s Brig. I am
      much afraid that our being unrestrained in our trade will prove a dangerous Trap by which many
      will suffer if these people are allowed to continue their pyracies and I can see no Remedy.
      Give my best Respects to [William] Hooper I intend by the next Post to write him as dull a
      Letter as this; I expect every day to hear from you what or whether any thing is doing to the

   <P>Having received a Letter from Mr <name>Enoch Moody</name>, Chairman of the Committee of Falmouth, that the
      Inhabitants of that Town are greatly alarmed by the Arrival of the Cerberus Man of War &amp;
      are under great Apprehension that some of the Kings Troops will be landed there, It is my
      desire that you raise all the force you can &amp; give the Town every Assistance in your power
      - The difficulty of removing Troops after they have made a lodgment or get possession of a
      place, is too obvious to be mentioned you will therefore use every possible method to prevent
      their effecting that or penetrating into the Country untill you have f[u]rther Orders-2 I am

   <P>I am ordered by <name>His Excellency</name> to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the 30th Ulto
      &amp; 3d inst Such articles on board the Vessels taken by Major Tupper as are Subject to
      perish: you had better have sold off immedy, the Vessels &amp; apurtenances to be securely
      Laid up, &amp; the Cargoes Carefully Stored, until farther orders from hence, a manifest of
      the Cargo, you will please to Send us, as soon as made out - The advanced Season of the Year
      &amp; the difficulty in procuring Cannon, will prevent the General's. ordering more Armed
      Vessels to be fitted out for the present-</P>
   <P>By your Last his Excellency observes that there are 118 pipes of Wine Saved out of a Vessel
      bound to Boston &amp; Wrecked at Eastham it is his desire that you willtake immediate Charge
      of them &amp; forward them to Cambridge with all Speed, where they will be Sold for the
      publick Use, &amp; where they fetch a good price if their Quality is tollerable -</P>
   <P><name>Capt Coit</name> has I find been so unlucky as to get aground again. I hope his Misfortunes are now
      over &amp; that Success will attend his Cruize, which it will give pleasure to hear he has
      Commenced -</P>
   <P>I hope the Lee is out again, the Chance of taking Prizes must soon be over from the Advance of
      the Season, therefore the Cruizers should now be in port as little as possible, which you will
      please to urge to the Gentlemen who Command them-</P>
   <P>The General is apprehensive, that <name>Capt Martindale</name> is going upon too large a Scale, &amp; that
      he will make the out[f]it of his Vessel too expensive - the intention of fitting out these
      Vessels, is not to attack the Armed, but to take the unarmed Vessels, which <name>Capt Martindale</name>
      Seems to have lost Sight of by putting Such a Number of Carriage Guns on board the Washington;
      but I sincerely hope his Success, will Amply repay the Expence. The Ammunition is preparing,
      40 Rounds for each gun, One barrel of loose powder for priming &amp;c &amp; a proper quantity
      of Match rope, I doubt much Whether we shall be able to get the Oznabrigs which the Captain
      writes for, if to be had it will go the Same Conveyance with the Ammumt10n, there is no
      Swivele Shot to be had here, if we cannot procure Some time enough Shall Send four Ounce ball,
      which I think will answer every purpose. You will please to Communicate the part of this
      Letter Which regards <name>Capt Martindale</name> unto him, &amp; to <name>Capt Bowen</name>, as I dont believe I shall
      have time to write them by this Conveyance, the 80 Men will be Sent &amp; Genl [Nathanael]
      Green[e] has been applied to for a 2d Lieutenant, the Master will be on just the same footing
      with the Masters of the other armed Vessels, I dont know the Use of a Drum &amp; fife on
      board, nor do I imagine that any of the other Vessels have got them, but if it will give Capt
      Martindale any pleasure he Shall be indulged with them - I am with respect Sir [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>The Carpenters of the Fleet that could be spared were at work at the Light House; the Caulkers

      Admiral received a Letter from Commodore <name>Le Cras</name> acquainting him with the Steps taken to
      secure the Cannon, Mortars and other Stores, which at first it was agreed between him and
      Colonel [Joseph] Goreham should be by putting the whole into the Navy Yard; but that Captain
      Spry of the Engineers had just informed him the Mortars only were to go into the Navy Yard.
      Commodore <name>Le Cras</name> transmitted an Account of the Cannon and Mortars there, b{it observes they
      are without Carriages: he also acquaints the Admiral with his having seized a Brig with Salt

   <Title>MAJOR GENERAL <name>PHILIP SCHUYLER</name> TO <name>GEORGE WASHINGTON</name> 1</Title>
   <P>Dear General</P>
   <P><name>Tionderoga Novr</name> 6th 1775.</P>
   <P>Your Excellency's Favor of the 26th Ult I had the Honor to receive on the 3d instant.</P>
   <P>I have long since signified to Congress the Necessity of a Delegation from them to this Place,
      and in their last to me of the 12th Ult:, they (unfortunately for me) say that it did not
      appear necessary then, I took the Liberty to lament that they were not in Sentiment with me on
      the Subject, &amp; to add that I thought it absolutely necessary that one should be sent, so
      that I hope soon to see some of the Gentlemen here, - A Variety of Regulations are necessary
      .to be made in this Quarter. A Task to which I feel Myself greatly inadequate, but which, if I
      had even Judgment enough to arrange with Propreity, the shattered Condition of my Constitution
      is such, that Matters so Momentous as these, should not be left to so precarious an [Event] as
      that of my being able to support the Fatigue, For General Montgomery, tho' endowed with
      shining Abilities will have his Time so totally engrossed with Other Matters that he will not
      be able to attend to these, </P>
   <P>Should Success crown our Endeavours at <name>St Johns</name>, of which there seems to be little Doubt, the
      entire Reduction of Canada will in all Probability be the Consequence, An Event which will
      open new Scenes, An Army to be forme[d] &amp; properly disposed of in that Quarter, Provisions
      Ammunition &amp; every Necessary to be procurd for It, Preparations to be made for the next
      Campaign, Proper Places to be dete~min'd on and Fortifications to be erected to defend that
      Province against any Attacks that may be made on It in the ensuing Year, Small Craft to be
      construct[ed] here, that a Reinforcement may be speedily sent into Canada, in Case it should
      be found necessary to support what Troops may be stationed there, Gallies carrying heavy
      Artillery to prevent Vessels of Force £roll? coming up the <name>St Lawrence</name>, A Mode of Government
      to be adopted in a Country where all will be Anarchy &amp; Confusion without It, and probably
      a Variety of-other interesting Regulations to take Place, that do not just now occur to
      me.</P>
   <P>Your Excellency will do me the Justice to beleive, that I feel in the most sensible Manner the
      favorable Opinion You are pleased to entert[ain] of me, And I am confident General Montgomery
      will not be less affected on what You observe of him. I do myself the Pleasure this Day to
      write that Gentleman &amp; shall convey to him Your best Wishes &amp; Respects. </P>
   <P>The vast Benefit that would result from a successful Conclusion of the Campaign, in this
      Quarter, has been so deeply impressed on me, that I have often regretted, that the Operations
      were not commenced at an earlier Period &amp; when commenced, that so much Tardiness prevailed
      in sending up the necessary Stores &amp; Troops. - That You my Dear General should feel an
      Anxiety, to induce You to ask those Questions, which You have done in so polite, &amp;
      friendly a Manner, is what I can easily suppose. </P>
   <P>The Difficulties under which General Montgomery has laboured, have been in the extream, &amp;
      which he most pathetically laments, in a Letter to me of the 13th Ult: (An Extract of which I
      do Myself the Honor to inclose, Your Excellency, together with the Opinion of a Council of War
      held on that Day &amp; which I forgot to transmit You, in the Hurry with which I sent off my
      last), And in his Letter of the 23d Ult. he says, &quot;Our Reinforcements not yet arrived, at
      this instant I have not in my Camp above 750 Men &amp; I wish much to send a strong Detachment
      to the Island of Montreal,&quot; a Manoevre which would have taken Place sooner, had it been
      in his Power or been prudent to have gone into, neither of which I think it was, &amp; shall
      beg Leave to make the following Observations, in Support of this Opinion. </P>
   <P>At no Period until this has it appeared to me that it would have been prudent to have passed
      <name>St Johns</name>, Altho' a sufficient Force could have been left for forming a Blockade, for previous
      to the Reduction of Chamblee, &amp; the Success of our Troops in replusing the Attack of
      <name>Monsieur Regouville</name> who was sent from Montreal, with two hundred &amp; forty Men &amp;
      expected to be joined by the Inhabitants of three of the most populous Parishes, on the South
      Side of the <name>St Lawrence</name>, in which he was disappointed to a Man, &amp; which has in some
      Measure evinced the Temper of the Canadians towards Us, &amp; given Us better Assurances, than
      any we have had of their friendly Disposition. for until then, their real Sentiments were
      problematical; and about this Time too we sunk their best armed Vessel so that we can now
      spare more Men for an Attack upon Montreal, Which if not prevented by Other Obstacles, was
      General Montgomery's Intention, as soon as the Reinforcement above alluded to should arrive,
      which took Place on the 26th or 27th &amp; Concisted of General [David] Woosters of three
      hundred &amp; thirty five &amp; Major [Barnabas] Tuthill of Colo: [James] Holmes's, with two
      hundred &amp; twenty five, Officers of both in eluded, In the Numbers however he will be
      disappointed, as General Wooster had returned four hundred &amp; eighty four Effectives from
      Albany, but discharged Ninety Nine between this &amp; Albany &amp; left fifty one, sick here,
      &amp; the Others too fell greatly short of what I expected. -</P>
   <P>If a Blockade had been formed, before the above mentioned Events took Place, It must have been
      sufficiently strong not only to have guarded against the Danger of a Sortie, but to have
      prevented the Enemys Armed Vessels, which greatly surpassed ours in Strength, from getting to
      the Southward of Us, &amp; thereby effectually cut off every possibility of Retreat, which if
      they had been able to accomplish, the Canadians I do firmly believe would immediately have
      joined Mr Carlton, but if a sufficient Body had been left, that, to make the Attempt on
      Montreal would have been too weak for such a Service &amp; if they had met with a Repulse, the
      Canadians in that Case would not have hesitated one Moment to have acted against Us, as Colo:
      Allen in his Report to me Observes, and all our Hopes in Canada would have been at an End, But
      another Difficulty presented It self (and which I do not know how the Detachment which General
      Montgomery proposed to send, or has sent will even now surmount) the Want of Craft to convey a
      Body of Troops sufficient to promise Success, to the Island of Montreal across the St
      Lawrence, which is deep, rapid &amp; wide, as no Craft can pass the Fort at <name>St Johns</name> to go
      down the Sorel, Which Obstacles would be immediately removed on the Reduction of that
      Fortress, which I hope has taken place by this Time, &amp; then I shall have the fullest
      Confidence that our labours will be at an End in this Quarter, Except from what Difficulties
      may arise from the intemperate Desire, our People have to return to their Habitations, My
      Fears on which Account I have expressed to Congress. -</P>
   <P>If we had passed it wholly &amp; could have got to &amp; succeeded against Montreal, <name>St Johns</name>
      would undoubtedly have fallen, but what a vast Risk! No less than that of the Loss of the
      whole Army, the Command of Lake Champlain, Tionderoga &amp; Crown Point! for no Retreat could
      possibly have taken Place, the Dependance on the Canadians uncertain &amp; if they had found
      Us incapable of passing to Montreal, for Want of Boats, or of Retreating on the same Account,
      It is certain we should have found them opposed to Us. - </P>
   <P>In this View of Things, I hope it will be thought that either Attempt would have been
      Injudicious. </P>
   <P>I do Myself the Honor to inclose You sundry Extracts of my Letters to Congress, with Extracts
      of their Answers, by which Your Excellency will perceive that I have hinted at several Things,
      which I conceivd claimed the Attention of Congress - Inclose You also a List of the Officers
      made Prisoners at <name>St Johns</name>, the Return of the Non Commissioned Officers &amp; Privates, is
      either Mislaid or by Mistake inclosed to Governor Trumbull. </P>

   <P>South-Carolina, Charlestown District:</P>
   <P>This day personally appeared before me, <name>John Wanton</name>, Captain of a sloop from Rhode-Island, who
      being duly sworn, sayeth, that on or about the twelfth of October last, he arrived in
      Rebellion Road, near Charlestown, in the Colony aforesaid, when Captain Thornbrough of the
      Tamer sloop of war, caused his vessel to anchor under his stern; and caused him, the said
      Deponent, to go on board the Cherokee, to speak with Lord <name>William Campbell</name>. That after the
      said Lord <name>William Campbell</name> had inquired into the Deponent's case, he told him, that by the
      late acts of parliament, his sloop was liable to be seized; and, that he should, in discharge
      of his duty, send him to St. Augustine; this Deponent apprehending, in order to be condemned.
      And afterwards, his mate informed him, that an officer from on board the Tamer privately
      acquainted him, the said mate, that Lord <name>William Campbell</name> had determined to send the
      Depenent's vessel to St. Augustine, in order to be condemned.</P>
   <P>That the said Lord <name>William Campbell</name>, against the consent of the said Deponent, caused an armed
      force to be put on board his vessel, to conduct her to St. Augustine. That Lord William
      Campbell did not make him, the Deponent, a bearer of any letter to Governor Tonyn. That he,
      the Deponent, never did tell Lord <name>William Campbell</name>, that he had two landsmen on board; having
      in reality two good seamen and a boy, who were fully sufficient to guard his vessel. That on
      the passage towards St. Augustine, one Walker, who, by Lord <name>William Campbell</name>, was put on board
      his, the Deponent's vessel to command her, told him, the Deponent, that he had a letter from
      Lord <name>William Campbell</name>, to Governor Tonyn; with strict orders, that if he was in any danger of
      being taken by the Americans, he should be sure to sink the said letter in the sea, with cwo
      swivel bullets, which the said Deponent saw; and which, the said Walker told him, had been
      delivered to him for that purpose. And the said Walker also told him, the Deponent, that Lord
      <name>William Campbell</name>'s Secretary had told him, that the letter was, to desire that soldiers should
      be sent to Charlestown from St. Augustine. And further this Deponent sayeth not. </P>

      Drayton, Esq; in answer to a letter of the 3d instant, wrote by him as President, contains
      expressions as unmerited as unbecoming the pen of a gentleman, and therefore unexpected from
      Capt. Thornbrough. - That because Lord <name>William Campbell</name> has favoured Capt. Thornbrough
      &quot;with an extract of his letter to Governor Tonyn,&quot; it does not thence follow, that
      the extract was faithfully made: and this Congress not having seen the original letter, or any
      other extract from it, ought to remember, we have just cause not to credit any thing from Lord
      <name>William Campbell</name>, which is not supported by absolute proof: neither does the extract prove,
      that Lord <name>William Campbell</name> did not write another letter to Governor Tonyn, to desire that
      troops should be sent against the good people of this Colony, and that Capt. Wanton's sloop
      should be condemned at St. Augustine. On the contrary, in the affidavit this day made by the
      said Capt. Wanton, and laid before this Congress, there is reason to conclude, that Lord
      <name>William Campbell</name> did actually write to Governor Tonyn, as well to procure troops, as to cause
      Capt. Wanton's sloop to be condemned: And as this important letter has never appeared to the
      public, it is not improbable, either that Governor Tonyn has received it, or that Walker has
      destroyed it, and that the extract in question, even if it is a faithful one, is from a letter
      written only as a mask to the other, and with intention, if necessary, to be delivered up to
      the public.</P>
   <P>Ordered, That Captain Wanton's affidavit, and resolution thereupon, be printed and made
      public, with the other papers already ordered and relative thereto. </P>

   <P>It is my Duty to inform your Lordship that the North Americans are amply supplied with Gun

      hazarding my humble opinion, that if the Americans have been proclaimed in Great Britain in
      actual Rebellion that it would have been much to the Advantage of His Government in this

      will be very obvious to your Lordship. </P>

      left England their Lordships were exceeding uneasy least the Rebels should make an Attempt to

   <P>Head Quarters [Cambridge], November 7, 1775.</P>
   <P>You are to proceed immediately to Portsmouth in New-Hampshire, and complete the Works already
      began, to secure that and the other Towns at the Entrance of Piscataway River, from any
      Attacks by Ships of War. For this Purpose, you are to fix Ships and Fire Rafts in such Places
      as you find most convenient to prevent the Enemy from passing up the River. As great
      Calamities and Distress are brought upon our Sea Port Towns, through the malicious Endeavours
      and false Representations of many Persons, holding Commissions under the Crown, who, not
      content with bringing Destruction upon some of our principal Towns, are xet using every Art
      that Malice can devise to reduce others to the same unhappy State; in Hopes, by such
      diabolical and cruel Conduct to please an arbitrary and tyrannical Ministry, and to receive
      from them in Return, a Continuance of such Places and Pensions as they now hold at the Expence
      of the Blood and Treasure of this distressed Continent.</P>
   <P>You are, therefore, immediately upon your arrival in that Province, to seize such Persons as
      hold Commissions under the Crown and are acting as open and avow'd Enemies to their Country,
      and hold them as Hostages for the Security of those Towns, which our ministerial Enemies
      threaten to invade. In Case any Attack should be made upon Portsmouth, or other Sea Ports in
      that Quarter, you are immediately to collect such Force as can be raised, to repel the
      Invasion; and at all Hazards prevent the Enemy from landing and taking Possession of any Posts
      in that Quarter. When you have completed the Works at Portsmouth, and secured the Passage of
      the-River there, you are to return without Delay to the Army, unless you find the Enemy are
      about to make an immediate Attack upon that or the neighbouring Towns; [the above is rather to
      be considered as matters of advice than orders; as I do not conceive myself authorized to
      Involve the Continent in any Expence for the defence of Portsmouth, or other place out of the
      Line of the great American defence; particular Colonies being called upon by the Congress to
      prepare for their own Internal Security. Given under my Hand, etc.] 2 </P>

   <P>[Boston] 7 [November]</P>
   <P>The <name>King George</name> Victualler for the Fleet arrived from England. The Swan with the Two Brothers
      Transport fell down to Nantasket, but the Wind coming Easterly they could not go to Sea. By
      the Swan the Admiral in several Letters of the 4th instant, acquainted Captain Wallace, that
      he would leave his supernumerary Marines with him all the Winter to strengthen his Force; That
      there was great difficulty in getting Vessels condemned, &amp; that the Judge of the Admiralty
      began to doubt his own power, but if the Phoenix (a Seizure of the Roses) should be cleared
      the Admiral would detain. her; That the day after the Viper sailed the Raven had arrived with
      Orders to seize the Property of Inhabitants of the four New England Governments &amp;c, which
      occasioning the Old General Orders to be discontinued, the Admiral had now sent a New Code for
      each Ship of his Squadron; That altho' the Swan was much out of Repair, yet he had sent her
      back to convoy the Transport and add to his Force until the Admiral could send another good
      Sloop or Frigate t&lt;;&gt; him; That the Admiral had sent a particular Account of all the
      Provisions Slops and Stores, as well what was supplied to the Swan as what was in the
      Transport, that Captain Wallace might be fully informed of the State of his Ships with respect
      to Stores, Slops and Provisions, as it might not be practicable to send him any further
      Supplies until the Spring; and that the admiral would have him clear the Transport as soon as
      possible, and load her with Hay and Wood for Boston, but if that could not be done to put
      useless and unserviceable Stores into her </P>

   <P>CAPTAIN <name>WILLIAM COIT</name> TO MAJOR <name>SAMUEL BLACHLEY WEBB</name> 1</P>
   <P>Sir: - </P>
   <P>Plymouth, Nov. 7th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Since I parted with you, I have made blackguard snatch at two of their provision vessels, and
      have them safe at Plymouth, and if you were where you could see me and did not laugh, all your
      risible faculties must perish. To see me strutting about on the quarter-deck of my schooner! -
      for she has a quarter-deck - Ah, and more than that too - 4 four pounders, brought into this
      country by the company of Lords Say and Seal, to Saybrook when they first came. A pair of
      cohorns that Noah had in the Ark; one of which lacks a touch-hole, having hardened steel drove
      therein, that she might not be of service to Sir <name>Edmund Andros</name> - Six swivels, the first that
      ever were landed at Plymouth, and never fired since.2 </P>
   <P>Now, that is my plague; but I can tell you somewhat of my comfort. My schooner is used to the
      business, for she was launched in the spring of 1761, and has served two regular
      apprenticeships to sailing, and sails quick, being used to it. Her accomodations are fine;
      five of us in the cabin, and when there, are obliged to stow spoon fashion. Besides, she has a
      chimney in it, and the smoke serves for bedding, victuals, drink and choking. She has one mast
      too, which is her foremast; she had a mainmast, but it was put in so long ago, that it has
      rotted off in the hounds. She has a deck, too. When it was first made, it was new; and because
      it was ashamed of being old, the first time we made use of a clawed handspike, it broke a hole
      through; notwithstanding, the wench knew it was directly over the magazine. Upon the whole, if
      there comes peace, I would recommend her and her apparatus, to be sent to the Royal Society;
      and I dare eat a red-hot gridiron if ever they have had, or will have, until the day of
      judgment, and curiosuty equal to her. I havn't time to give you her character in full, but, in
      short, she is the devil. But while I can keep the sea and light only on unarmed vessels, she
      will do very well. But if obliged to fire both guns of a side at a time, it would split her
      open from her gunwale to her keelson. </P>
   <P>Pray make my compliments to all friends. Tell friend White, Plymouth is better. than all the
      Rhode [Island] and Newport to boot. My mast will be finished to-morrow, I hope, and then away
      goes your most humble servant </P>

   <P>I am doubtful of Success at Quebec of Col. Arnold &amp; his 1400 Troops, which marched about
      18 or 20 Sept. and on 2d Oct. were at Norridgwalk. I find that Gov. Carleton formed (on 17
      Sepr) the Inhabitants of Quebec into Eleven Companies of Canadians &amp; six of British
      Inhabitants. Total 17 Campa (about 60 each) makg Eleven Hundred Men, &quot;many of whom
      neglect &amp; others think the duty hard, &amp; the greatest part are dissatisfied with the
      Conduct of Government.&quot; Now if 300 are heartily for the King, they can defend the City
      against Col. Arnolds 12 or 1400. The most of the British Campa I suppose are Europeans and
      Scotchmen, almost all these perhaps 350) are against us &amp; full of Vengeance. The Courtiers
      among the Canadians are also against us. So it is probable Carleton has eno' to defend him.
      But as to <name>St Johns</name> there is hope. Gen. Montgomery is round it with an Army of between 3 and
      4000. </P>

      you may then send the Vessels eastward thro the Sound to New London or Norwich in order to be
      armed and fitted. Should this be the case you will repair immediately to the place where the
      Ships are to be fitted, and there use every means in your power to procure this to be done
      with the utmost expedition. In the Colony of Connecticut you are to procure powder for both
      these Vessels, and such other Military Stores as can there be had. You will procure the Cannon
      and other Stores at New York or any other place where it can be done in the best and most
      expeditious manner. You will also procure Officers and Men suitable for these Vessels, As soon
      as these Vessels can possibly be fitted for the Sea, you will order them immediately into
      Delaware Bay. You will by every opportunity give us the most exact intelligence of all your
      proceedings by conveyances the most safe and secure that can be obtained. You are empower'd to
      draw on Governor Hopkins for such sums of money as may be necessary for the above business. </P>

      Governor General of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia, and Vice Admiral of the same. </P>
   <P>A Proclamation.</P>
   <P>AS I have ever entertained Hopes, that an Accommodation might have taken Place between
      Great-Britain and this Colony, without being compelled by my Duty to this most disagreeable
      but now absolutely necessary Step, rendered so by a Body of armed Men unlawfully assembled,
      firing on His Majesty's Tenders, and the formation of an Army, and that Army now on their
      March to attack His Majesty's Troops and destroy the well disposed Subjects of this Colony. To
      defeat such treasonable Purposes, and that all such Traitors, and their Abettors, may be
      brought to Justice, and that the Peace, and good Order of this Colony may be again restored,
      which the ordinary Course of the Civil Law is unable to effect; I have thought fit to issue
      this my Proclamation, hereby declaring, that until the aforesaid good Purposes can be
      obtained, I do in Virtue of the Power and Authority to Me given, by His Majesty, determine to
      execute <name>Martial Law</name>, and cause the same to be executed throughout this Colony: and to the end
      that Peace and good Order may the sooner be restored, I do require every Person capable of
      bearing Arms, to resort to His Majesty's Standard, or be looked upon as Traitors to His
      Majesty's Crown and Government, and thereby become liable to the Penalty the Law inflicts upon
      such Offences; such as forfeiture of Life, confiscation of Lands, &amp;c. &amp;c. And I do
      hereby further declare all indented Servants, Negroes, or others, (appertaining to Rebels,)
      free that are able and willing to bear Arms, they joining His Majesty's Troops as soon as may
      be, for the more speedily reducing this Colony to a proper Sense of their Duty, to His
      Majesty's Crown and Dignity. I do further order, and require, all His Majesty's Leige
      Subjects, to retain their Quitrents, or any other Taxes due or that may become due, in their
      own Custody, till such Time as Peace may be again restored to this at present most unhappy
      Country, or demanded of them for their former salutary Purposes, by Officers properly
      authorised to receive the same. </P>

      could not be supplied with 15 Days Provisions, &amp; that I intended proceeding the Next Day
      with 15 Men to Sartigan to Send back Provissions to the Detacht I accordingly Set Out the 28th
      Early in the morng &amp; Descended the River, amazingly rapid &amp; Rocky for Abt 20 Miles
      when we had the Misfortune to stave three of the battoes and lose their provisions &amp;c but

      I heartily Congratulate you On your Success, thus farr, I think you have Great reason to be
      Apprehensive for me - the Time I mentioned to <name>Genl Washington</name> being so long Since elapsed, I
      was not then apprised, or indeed Apprehensive of One half of the Difuculties we have had to
      en[c]ounter, of which I cannot at Present Give you a Particular Detail, can Only Say we have,
      hawled Our Battoes up Over falls, up rapid Streams, over Carrying Places &amp; Marched thro'
      Morasses, thick Woods &amp; Over Mountains, About 320 Miles, many of which we had to Pass
      several Times to bring Our Baggage. These [di]fuculties the Soldiers have with the greatest

      with <name>Colo Enos</name> Returned from the Dead River Contrary to my Expectation, he having Orders to

      &amp; as I have had no Answer from either &amp; he Pretends being taken at Quebec, I make no
      Doubt he has betrayed his trust, which I am Confirmd in as I find They have been Some time
      Apprised of Our Coming in Quebec &amp; have Destroyed All the Canoes at Pt Levy to prev[ent]
      Our Passing, this Dificulty will be obviated by Birch Canoes as we have abt 20 of them with 40
      Savages who have Joined us &amp; profess Great Friendship as well as the Canadians, by whom we
      have been very Friendly received, &amp; who will be able to furnish Us with a Number of
      Canoes. </P>

      secure, and take possession of, and keep Falmouth Neck in our own power, if possible, by our
      utmost exertions. Accordingly, we advised and ordered the most of the soldiers in the Colony
      service on these sea-coasts to be immediately set to work to make an intrenchment, to prevent
      boats from landing for the future, and, at the same time, appointed a Committee to view an
      eminence on said Falmouth-Neck, in order to begin to build a fort, and keep possession and
      advantage of the ground from our enemies, with directions to continue what number of men was
      necessary and proper, besides the soldiers, to carry on the affair, and apportion the same on
      the several towns, according to their circumstances, situation, and abilities. While these
      things were in agitation, and before we had well got through, the Cerberus man-of-war hove in
      sight, and ran into Falmouth harbour and Captain Symons, the commander, sent orders and
      letters on shore, copies of which Mr. Freeman will be able to lay before you, if needed. The
      several towns in the County were sent to, by letters originating from the Honourable Colonel
      Freeman, with orders and advice to raise half the Militia. A number of the Militia and
      soldiers repaired to Falmouth, as soon as their distance and situation would admit; but, the
      weather being very stormy, nothing could be done till Saturday [November 4], when the ground
      was viewed, the men put under some regulation, and tools prepared to begin an intrenchment
      that night, (while Captain Symons, not thinking it proper to stay and see his orders put in
      execution, came to sail in the evening, and went out of the harbour.) The men accordingly
      broke ground, and worked the most of the night, and have continued so to do ever since, in all
      proper times for working, each town having successive drafts from the Militia to supply the
      place of their former drafts, so as constantly to carry on the work; while we have some who
      are fitting out the few cannon we have for use, with a small matter of powder we have got; but
      our want of men, and want of powder, and other military stores, throw us into great anxiety.
      We would further beg leave to suggest that this part of the country may be of some importance
      to all the other parts, and perhaps we might say great; here are large stocks of cattle, of
      all kinds, and fuel and lumber of every kind, together with masts, which have been beneficial
      to almost all the seacoasts on the Continent, and to Britain, and may be so again, and which
      would be extremely advantageous to our enemies, should they get the possession of it. We would
      likewise beg leave further to suggest, that although Casco-Bay is ten leagues across from cape
      to cape, yet Falmouth harbour is the most likely shipharbour in the bay to command the country
      around; and must, in all probability, command great part of the Province of Maine, be it in
      whose hands it will. </P>
   <P>Thus have we very briefly presumed to lay before you our distresses and wants, and also our
      important situation in the present and future scale of American affairs. Praying that your
      Honours would take our peculiarly distressing circumstances into consideration, as soon as may
      be, and grant us relief, by affording us men, and such warlike stores, of every kind, as you
      shall judge proper, together with an able, faithful, and an experienced head officer, and an
      engineer and other officers, as you shall think needful; and also organize the Militia in this
      County, that they may with the more ease and expedition be drawn out, on any emergency; or
      otherwise relieve us, as, in your known wisdom, you shall think fit and see meet. And your
      petitioners, as in duty bound, shall ever pray. Signed by order of the Convention: </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Cambridge, November 8th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Dear Sir, -</P>
   <P>The shipwreck of a vessel, said to be from Philadelphia to Boston, near Plymouth, with 120
      pipes of wine; 118 of which are saved - another from Boston to Halifax, near Beverly, with
      about £240 worth of dry goods - the taking of a wood vessel, bound to Boston, by Captain Adams
      - and the sudden departure of Mr. [Edmund] Randolph (occasioned by the death of his uncle
      [<name>Peyton Randolph</name>]), are all the occurrences worth noticing, which have happened since you left
      this.</P>
   <P>I have ordered the wine and goods to this place, for sale; as also the papers; the latter may
      unfold secrets that may not be pleasing to some of your townsmen: and which, so soon as known,
      will be communincated. 2 </P>
   <P>I have been happy enough to convince Captain McPherson, as he says, of the propriety of
      returning to the Congress - he sets out this day, and I am happy in his having an opportunity
      of laying before them a scheme for the destruction of the naval force of Great Britain. </P>
   <P>P.S. - I had just finished my letter when a blundering Lieutenant of the blundering Captain
      Coit, who had just blundered upon two vessels from <name>Nova Scotia</name>, came in with the account of
      it, and before I could rescue my letter, without knowing what he did, picked up a candle and
      sprinkled it with grease; 3 but these are kinds of blunders which one can readily excuse. The
      vessels contain hay, livestock, poultry, &amp;c., and are now safely moored in Plymouth
      harbour. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P><name>Cambridge Novr</name> 8th 1775.</P>
   <P>The immediate Occasion of my giving the Congress the Trouble of a Letter at this Time, is to
      inform them, that in Consequence of their Order signified in your Letter of the 20th Ult. I
      laid myself under a solemn Tye of Secrecy to Capt. [John] McPherson, and proceeded to examine
      his Plan for the Destruction of the Fleet in the Harbour of Boston, with that Care and
      Attention, which the Importance of it deserved, and my Judgment could lead to: but not being
      happy eno' to coincide in opinion with that Gentleman, and finding that his Scheme would
      involve greater Expence than (under my Doubts of its Success) I thought myself justified in
      giving into, I prevailed upon him to communicate his Plan to three Gentlemen of the Artillery
      (in this Army) well acquainted with the Knowledge &amp; Practice of Gunnery. By them he has
      been convinced that inasmuch as he set out on wrong Principles, the Scheme would prove
      abortive. Unwilling however to relinquish his favourite Project of reducing the naval Force of
      Great Britain, he is very desirous of building a Number of Row-Gallies for this Purpose. But
      as the Congress alone are competent to the Adoption of this Measure, I have advised him,
      (altho he offered to go on with the Building of them at his own Expence till the Congress
      should decide) to repair immediately to Philada with his Proposals, where if they should be
      agreed to, or Vessels of superiour Force agreeable to the Wishes of most othere should be
      resolved on, he may set instantly about them with the Materials upon the Spot. Here they are
      to collect. To him therefore I refer for further Information on this Head.</P>
   <P>A Vessel said to be from Philada and bound to Boston with 120 Pipes of Wine (118 of which are
      secured) stranded at a Place called Eastham in a Gale of Wind, on the 2d-Inst - another from
      Boston to Halifax with dry Goods &amp;c amounting per Invoice to about £ 240 lawful got
      disabled in the same Gale near Beverly.2 These Cargoes, with the Papers, I have ordered to
      this Place, the Vessels to be taken Care of till forther Orders. I have also an Account of the
      taking of a Wood Sloop bound to Boston, and carried into Portsmouth by one of our armed
      Vessels, Particulars not yet come to Hand; and this Instant of two others from <name>Nova Scotia</name> to
      Boston with Hay, Wood, live Stock &amp;c by another of our armed Schooners. These are in
      Plymouth. </P>
   <P>These Accidents and Captures point out the Necessity of establishing proper Courts without
      Loss of Time for the Decision of Property, and the Legallity of Seizures: otherwise I may be
      involved in inextricable Difficulties. </P>
   <P>Our Prisoners by the Reduction of <name>Fort Chamblee</name> (on which happy Event I most sincerely
      congratulate the Congress) being considerably augmented and likely to be encreased, I submit
      it to the Wisdom of Congress whether some convenient inland Towns remote from the Post Roads
      ought not to be assigned them the Manner of their Treatment - Subsistance &amp;c defined, and
      a Commissary, or Agent, appointed to see that Justice is done both to them &amp; the Public -
      proper Accounts rendered &amp;c. Without a Mode of this Sort is adopted, I fear there will be
      sad Confusion hereafter, as there are great Complaints already. </P>
   <P>I reckoned without my Host when I informed the Congress in my last that I should in, a Day, or
      two, be able to acquaint them of the Disposition of the Soldiery towards a new Inlistment. I
      have been in Consultation with the Generals of this Army ever since Thursday last [November
      2], endeavouring to establish new Corps of Officers, but find so many Doubts &amp;
      Difficulties to reconcile, I cannot say when they are to end, or what may be the Consequences,
      as there appears to be such an Unwillingness in the officers of one Government mixing in the
      same Regiment with those of another, and without many must be dismissed who are willing to
      serve, notwithstanding we are deficient on the whole. I am to have another Meeting today upon
      this Business, and shall inform you of the Result. </P>
   <P>The Council of Officers are unanimously of Opinion that the Command of the Artillery should no
      longer continue in Col: [Richard] Gridley; and knowing of no Person better qualified to supply
      his Place, or whose Appointment will give more general Satisfaction, have taken the Liberty of
      recommending <name><name>Henry Knox</name> Esqr</name> to the Consideration of the Congress, thinking it indispensably
      necessary at the same Time that this Regiment should consist of two Lieut Colonels, two
      Majors, and twelve Companies agreeably to the Plan &amp; Estimate handed in, which differing
      from the last Establishment, I should be glad to be instructed on. </P>
   <P>The Commissary Genl not being returned will apologize, I hope, for my Silence respecting a
      Requisition of the Expence of his Clerks &amp;c which I was to have obtained, together with
      others and forwarded. </P>
   <P>I have heard Nothing of Col: Arnold since the 13th Ult. His Letter of, and Journal of that
      Date will convey all the Information I am able to give him. think he must be in Quebec. If any
      Mischance had happened [to] him, he would, as directed, have forwarded an Express. No Account
      yet of the armed Vessels sent to <name>St Lawrence</name>. I think they will meet with the Stores inward or
      outward bound. </P>
   <P>Capt. Symons in the Cerberus lately sent from Boston to Falmouth hath published the enclosed
      Declaration at that Place, and it is suspected intends to make some Kind of Lodgment there. 3
      I wrote immediately to Col Fennie [<name>Edmund Phinney</name>] (of this Army) who went up there upon the
      last Alarm, to spirit up the People, and oppose it at all Events. Falmouth is about 130 Miles

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> Novr 8, 1775,</P>
   <P>The small Squadron under the Command of Lieut. Mowat mentioned in my Letter October 9 returned
      to Boston the 2d instant. I transmit a Copy of Lieut. Mowats Account of his Expedition, and am
      extremely concerned the badness of his Vessels and Stores prevented his doing more than
      destroy[ing] the Town of Falmouth. This however is a severe Stroke to the Rebels Falmouth
      having long been a principal Magazine of all kinds of Merchandize, from whence, besides
      supplying the scattered Villages in the Provinces of New Hampshire and Massachusets Bay, large
      Quantities of Goods were usually transported in small Vessels to Newbury Port and froll).
      thence by Land to the Rebel Army round Boston. This is our first Essay, we shall in a little
      time be better provided, and you may be assured we shall not allow the Rebels to remain
      quiet.</P>
   <P>The Master of the Halifax having died on board of the small Pox,2 and many of the Schooners
      Crew having never had that Disorder, I have ordered her to anchor at a distance from the
      Ships, and to have no Communication with them while any Infection remains.</P>
   <P>On the 3d instant the Viper came in from New York with the Mails, but last from Rhode Island.
      Captain Wallace in a Letter October 25 tells me that Affairs remain there in much the same
      situation as mentioned in his last; That the Towns People take great pains to remove the
      Rebels off the Island, and to that end sent a Deputation to the Camp, where there is a
      Committee from the Continental Congress, and obtained Orders for the Rebels to be removed a
      greater distance from the Town and by no means to enter; and to supply his Majesty's Ships
      with every thing they want, upon the Ferry Boats and Market Boats being permitted to pass; but
      Captain Wallace says this he does not accept, but insists upon their leaving the Island and is
      flattered he shall succeed. </P>
   <P>Captain Vandeput informs me an Association was proposed, about a Fortnight before the date of
      this Letter (October 18), to three Regiments raised in Philadelphia requiring them to sign to
      obey all Orders of the Congress, and to submit to military Discipline, which was refused to a
      Man. ---- at New York has publickly changed his Plan and is now one of the most strenuous for
      supporting the Governor, who I find took Shelter on board the Packet, upon being informed the
      Congress had recommended it to make him a Prisoner; and though on writing to the Magistrates,
      he had the strongest Assurances that nothing of that sort was intended, and that he might
      depend upon the Support of the Citizen, yet he does not think these Assurances a sufficient
      Security. </P>
   <P>I hear also that the Sailors at Philadelaphia are much dissatisfied with the branch being
      taken from their Pilots, they say they are to be made Galley Slav[es;] for the Town has built
      large Boats with a great Gu[n] in each, which are called Gallies. I transmit a Letter wherein
      particular mention is made of the Construction and intended use of them. </P>
   <P>The Swan sailed the 7th with the Transports mentioned in my Letter Novr 2d laden with
      provisions and Stores. I sent Directions by her to Captain Wallace to make use of any method
      in his power to prevent the Rebels fortifying Rhode Island, and to acquaint the Inhabitants
      that whatever Resentment they may apprehend from the whole Continent, their not assisting to
      drive out the Rebels will inevitably bring upon them the destruction of the Town of Newport,
      in its consequences more to be dreaded by them than any punishment the Congress can inflict;
      and that they will avert the impending Blow by instantly declaring themselves to be on the
      Side of Government, and heartily uniting with us in repelling the common Enemy. I have desired
      Captain Wallace to let every other Consideration yield to the preserving this Island, and to
      endeavour by sinking Rebel Vessels in the Channel to destroy the Navigation of the River
      leading to Providence, which I hope he will be able to do. </P>
   <P>The Hinchinbrooke Schooner commanded by Lieutenant [Alexander] Ellis arrived from Halifax the
      6th instant, compleatly fitted. Lieut. Ellis having taken in Six Pounders at Halifax, I have

      and having frequently observed, that the plan we at present pursue is a very lame one, for the
      remedying of which I have often offered my discourse, but as we are momentarily interrupted by
      our discontented gentry, I resolve to pen down and lay before you the following considerations
      in our present situation, at the post of Martelaars Rock, in the Highlands: </P>
   <P>The number of men now employed on the fortifications are 137; they being distributed as
      follows, vizt: </P>
   <P>Carpenters, 36 Stewart, 1 Masons, 27 Cooks, 5 Blacksmiths, 2 Overseers, 3 Miners, 4 Seamen
      employed as such on shore, 2 69 Do. in vessels, 4 Mortar makers, 2 Actual labourers, 51 </P>
   <P>68 Artificers as above, 69 </P>
   <P>, Total, 137 </P>
   <P>This distribution is the most erroneous that can possibly be imagined, and must tend to retard
      our works; nor can we pretend to do any thing, till better regulations take place. </P>
   <P>This will appear from the following estimate, which I judge to be right, but am willing to
      submit the same to the opinion of any able engineer or engineers: Each mason ought to have as
      attendants 2 stone breakers, 2 stone carriers, 1 mortar carrier - 5 in all. </P>
   <P>With this assistance, each mason will with ease make 100 cubical feet of stone wall in 12
      hours' time, provided to every 4 masons, one miner be allowed to work in the quarry. </P>
   <P>Thus it is evident, that our 27 masons, attended by 135 labourers and 7 miners, would have
      completed the 2400 perches of stone wall, contained in my estimate in 28 days of 12 hours
      each; but to allow for extra occurrences I will say 30 days. </P>
   <P>Then it follows that 27 masons, suppose them to have 9s.6d. per day each, including
      provisions, will daily cost £12 16s. 6d. Seven miners, suppose them 6s. provisions included,
      is daily £2 2s. which will amount in 30-days to £454 10s. </P>
   <P>N.B. Please to observe that in my estimate the labourers' work stands as a separate article.
      But instead of such a regular arrangement, a very different one has unhappily taken place at
      this post, by which means only about 700 perches are done. What need have I to animadvert on
      so palpable an absurdity, as that of half of 51 labourers to attend on 27 masons? I say
      one-half; for surely the other half must be allowed for the attendance on our carpenters. But
      what makes it worse, this very day on which I write, I am reduced to the dilemme of keeping
      only 7 masons on the principal work; the other 20 are necessarily employed in breaking and
      carrying stone, by reason that all the labourers are employed in unloading of vessels there
      being now 3 craft at the pier head; and for fourteen or fifteen days past there have generally
      been 2; nor are we ever without one (at least,) to unload; thus the labourers are all taken
      off, and men, who are hired at 7s.6d. per diem, do that labour for the doing of which men may
      be had at 50s. per month. Where then is the wonder, that we advance not as we should do, and
      that the expense becomes great. </P>
   <P>With regard to the timber work, I have the following to offer. </P>
   <P>We are on an island where we have not a single stick of timber fit to do any thing with,
      except making firewood, and not even that, as most is a shrubby kind of pine. If we had it,
      the expense of carrying it out of the woods and bringing it to the work, would be to the
      amount of 10s. per 100 feet, especially if done by the labour of men (only) without oxen;
      whereas now we have good oak delivered at the landing, at 6s. </P>
   <P>I will undertake and promise to build a block house, such as we have now erected, in 6 weeks,
      with 6 hands and 2 oxen, including 1 week as allowance for bad weather; whereas now 12
      carpenters and 20 labourers have been employed on the timber work thereof since the 10th of
      October, and will not have completely done till the 10th of November; nor happens this by
      reason that the men are idlers; no, but they are not conversant with similar work. It is true,
      they receive the timbers in a muddy dirty state, with a bad appearance; but it is hewn truer
      than they are able to do it; then to reduce it to what they judge to be a true square, they
      line it and hew half way down; afterwards turn it, line it again, and hew the other half way:
      thus a piece of timber is lined eight times, and hewed to these eight lines, to make it worse
      than it was; next the piece, through lack of oxen, is drawn by 20 men, to the place where it
      is wanted; here the carpenters discover it not to be hewn in the square, and line it and hew
      it again eight times over; then the dovetail is cut, and when put together, they see it makes
      bad joints, therefore have it to dub over again; whereas the country carpenters, (used to such
      work) hew the whole side through by one line, and thereby leaves it, when he parts with it,
      truer than our people (unacquainted with such work,) can possibly do. </P>
   <P>The expense of one block house stands as follows: £ s. d. The timber and plank, 14,000 feet,
      at 6s. per 100, 42 00 0 2,000 shingles, at £5 per M, 10 00 0 Much against my inclination and
      advice, 256 iron bolts have been used instead of so many trundles, These weigh each 5 lbs. is
      1,280 lbs. at £28 per ton 17 18 4 Carried forward, 53 00 0 Brought forward, Necessary iron 275
      lbs. at £28 per _ton, 53 ,3 00 17 0 0 200 weight of nails at 9d. 7 10 0 Work of twelve
      carpenters, 30 days at 9s. 6d. per day, provisions in- eluded 185 00 0 In my estimate no value
      of labour in timber work is mentioned, as it is of the masons, therefore I must add, 20
      labourers, at 3s. per day, for 30 d::t.ys, provisions included, 90 0 0 </P>
   <P>£365 5 4 </P>
   <P>But according to my method of building, with such people as I could find, The timber,
      necessary iron, shingles and nails would be £63 7 0 Instead of 256 bolts, as many trundles
      would not exceed , 1 10 0 Six carpenters, 36 days, at 9s. 6d. per day, provisions included,
      102 12 0 A yoke of oxen, teamster included, 12s. per day for 15 days 9 00 0 </P>
   <P>£176 9 0 </P>
   <P>The country carpenter is still inferior to the ship carpenter for our work, provided we can
      get him equally honest. </P>
   <P>From the above small specimen it is evident that even in the cheapest method, timber at this
      place comes infinitely higher than the masonry, and I am now convinced that stone towers of
      the nature of block-houses, would not amount to above £100 each complete at this place, and
      when finished they are preferable. </P>
   <P>Among other bad regulations that have taken place here, there is one most grievously against
      the sound policy that ought to prevail; beside the carpenters from the city, some country
      carpenters are employed who have a chief as well the former, and being a more diligent set of
      people than those from the city, have very deservedly (though somewhat injudiciously) some
      marks of special favour shown them. </P>
   <P>From this distinction sprung envy, who never fails in all similar cases to rear her head. I
      will only remark that such favours ought to have been shown in a manner somewhat less open;
      yet in favour of the country carpenters. I must say that they labour harder and do not stand
      on the punctilium of stated hours. Likewise I believe had the country carpenters been first
      engaged, they might have been hired for 6s. per day, and thus been an example to the others.
      The breach is already pretty large between them; should it continue to widen so that it
      becomes necessary to remove one party, my advice is to remove those from the city. </P>
   <P>We have seen that the two oxen in one day drew twelve pieces of timber and four pieces of
      cannon from the landing to the block house, a labour which would have employed, according to
      our experience, twenty men for two days. In other matters this holds exactly similar.
      Therefore twenty men, at 3s. per day, provisions included, is for two days, £6; and two oxen,
      with the teamster, cost, if hired for one day, 12s.; here rises a balance of £5 8s. per day. </P>
   <P>Your winter's firing will be impossible to get without oxen; in getting that and drawing of
      timber, each yoke will do the work of thirty men at least. </P>
   <P>This makes the reason appear evident why I have so strenuously recommended the procuring of
      oxen. They will cost thirty bushels of corn and one load of hay per head in four months, equal
      to about £7; and then, if care is taken of them, they will sell for the original price; but if
      they are kept in the same manner as the two we have now are, I confess they had better been
      left alone, for you will want new oxen every fourteen days. </P>
   <P>The next and greatest grievance to be considered is the erroneous principle on which our
      labourers are procured. Instead of hiring them for a month, and thereby giving them an
      opportunity of harrassing us in the shocking manner they do, I humbly think, gentlemen, that
      you ought to recommend it, that they be enlisted for a limited time, suppose six months, be it
      under the denomination of pioneers, or whatever else may be thought a proper appellation for
      such a body. </P>
   <P>I cannot omit mentioning that when I first took a superficial view of the ground, I judged it
      to be less rough than it proves to be. I likewise thought that there was more wood, which made
      me put down more axes, billhooks and spades than I now find it necessary, we being here in the
      very extreme of rough ground; yet the number sent up is more disproportioned than even my
      rought estimate. I will point out the just proportion of tools as they ought to be given to
      the workmen; it may be of use.</P>
   <P>In extreme rough ground. In extreme fine soil. 1-10 shovels. 1-4 spades. 1-20 spades. 1-2
      shovels. 1-16 miner's hammers. 1-8 grubbing hoes. 1-8 Jumpers. 1-16 pickaxes. 1-16 wedges and
      cold chissels. 1-40 axes. 1-8 small crowbars. 3-80 billhooks. 1-40 larg~ crowbars with claws.
      1-8 mauls. 1-16 pickaxes. 1-8 grubbing hoes. 7-80 axes. 1-20 billhooks. </P>
   <P>The mediums must be calculated according to the nature of soils between these two extremes. </P>
   <P>We cannot work here without powder. I know it is scarce, but suppose it to cost even 10s. per
      pound, and that four miners make eight holes per diem with an inch augur, which require each 2
      ½ inch of powder, this will make twenty inches of powder; now twenty-one inches of powder in
      an inch hole makes three pounds; therefore three times 10 is 30s. and four miners at 6s. per
      day is 24s. together £2 14s. and these four miners will break more stone than thirty men with
      mauls can do; yet these thirty men would cost you, provisions included, 3s. each, which
      amounts to £4 10s. per diem. </P>
   <P>Another thing I have to remonstrate to you, gentlemen: this is, that the steward never yet has
      been made to keep a regular book of the accounts of his delivery of provisions, &amp;c. which,
      however, in my opinion, is highly necessary; likewise that a person ought to be appointed who
      should take an exact account of what tools are delivered out in the morning, and to whom,
      observing at night that the same person returns a similar tool, be it whole or broken. This
      method is far preferable to that of throwing by a broken axe, maul, or crowbar, while nobody
      knows how tools are expended. In my humble opinion, the steward could do this without adding
      much vexatious labour to his present employment. </P>
   <P>The number of strangers who come nolens volens to visit us, is a gross grievance. A rascal,
      who does not vouchsafe to lift his hat to us, nor even avoids to insult us, comes in to our
      innermost recess and interrupts us perhaps at a time when we are consulting the welfare of the
      community. </P>
   <P>By noticing the above mistakes and properly amending them, I make no doubt but we will, in
      this day of need, save a great sum of money for our country. </P>
   <P>I entreat you therefore to endeavour the making the necessary alterations, in which I am
      highly interested, by reason that the rank I hold endangers me of being made the butt against
      which all resentment may break; because if the present measures continue, my calculations will
      prove erroneous; but if these mistakes in proceedings are altered as I propose, my estimate
      must prove true, or nearly so; the power lies with you, gentlemen. I have never received any
      kind of instructions from the Congress or Committee that may serve me as a line for the
      regulation of my conduct, except that I understood their intentions were that I should give
      you my advice, and therefore consider myself in duty bound to be content under your direction
      of affairs in every particular; but I could not forbear taking this liberty in telling you
      what I think the most eligible path to pursue. I am, with the greatest respect, gentlemen,

   <P>P.S. The draft of the above writing was prepared before Capt. Bedlow and Grenell came up;
      since that some variation in our distribution of labourers and masons has taken place; though
      it is better than the former, it is still very absurd and only serves to shew the instability
      of our plan. </P>

   <Title>JOURNAL OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS 1</Title>
   <P>[Philadelphia] Wednesday, November 8, 1775 </P>
   <P>On motion made, Resolved, That the Secret Committee appointed to contract for the importation
      of arms, ammunition, &amp;c. be empowered to export to the foreign, West Indies, on account
      and risque of the Continent, as much provision, or any other produce (except horned cattle,
      sheep, hogs, and poultry) as they may deem necessary for the importation of arms, ammunition,
      sulphur, and salt petre.</P>
   <P>The Congress taking into consideration the report of the Committee to whom were referred the
      letters from the convention of New York and the state of that colony,</P>
   <P>Resolved, That a commander with the rank of Colonel, be appointed to take the command of the
      fortifications or fortresses on the Highlands on Hudson's river.</P>
   <P>Resolved, That it be recommended to the convention of New York, to empower him the said
      commander to call together and command two hundred men of the militia of Duchess, Orange, and
      Ulster Counties, and one Company of artillery from the city of New York, who shall be
      stationed in the high lands until relieved by the company of Artillery, directed by this
      Congress to be raised in the city of New York, and such other continental troops as may
      hereafter be directed to take possession of the same.</P>
   <P>Resolved, That it be recommended to the Convention of New York, if they have not already sent
      forward a sufficient number of cannon for the defence of the fortresses erecting in the
      highlands, that they immediately send forward to those fortresses so many of the cannon at
      King's bridge of the best quality and largest bore, as they may think necessary for that
      purpose.</P>
   <P>On motion made, Resolved, That the bills of sale, for the vessels ordered to be bought, be
      made to the continental treasurers, or those who succeed them in that office, in trust
      nevertheless for the use of the Continent, or their representatives in Congress met. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That the appointment of a commander of the fortresses at the highlands on Hudson's
      river be deferred till to Morrow morning. 2 </P>
   <P>Mr. [Eliphalet] Dyer having, on account of his indisposition, excused himself from going to
      the northward, the Congress proceeded to the election of another when Mr. R[obert] R.
      Livingston was chosen. </P>

   <P>By Captain [James] Leech, arrived here from New-Providence, we learn, that a man of war and
      two transports lately arrived at that island from Boston, and demanded all the powder and

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>By the General Gage who sails this day I have the Honour of informing you of my Arrival here
      of the 5th inst, as also the Brig Elizabeth loaded with Arms, Ammunition and Cloathing &amp;c.
      The Dispatches I had on board for General Carleton I delivered to Lieut. Governor Carnake 2
      who has sent them to the General at Montreal. </P>
   <P>I had under Convoy the Jacob Brig with Arms, Ammuniti[on] &amp;c for Quebec. I parted with her
      the 26th Ulto in a Fog, but she is this Morning arrived, and, as I have Orders on the delivery
      of the Jacob to put myself under your Command, should have put them in execution immediately,
      was it not for the distressed situation of this City and Province. The Canadians unfaithful,
      and destitute of Guns in the Garrison, the Lieut. Governor has represented to me the use of
      his Majesty's Ship Lizard, and desiring my Stay to protect, as much as lay in my Power, the
      Garrison of Quebec against the Rebels, who are advancing fast towards it; and as I have
      thought it necessary to comply therewith, I shall execute such Orders as I shall receive from
      General Carleton for his Majesty's Service to the utmost of my power. The Lieutenant Governor
      has requested the Marines on board the Lizard might be landed, as he had no Men in the
      Garrison to be depended on, and I accordingly ordered them to disembark which they did. I
      found here his Majesty's <name>Sloop Hunter</name>, Captain Mackenzie, who has your Orders which I shall be
      guided by. The Money I brought the Governor has directed me to keep on board, thinking it not
      safe on shore, but to be supplied as Occasion shall serve: neither does he think it fit to
      land the Arms &amp;c out of the Storeships but remain on board under the protection of my
      Guns. </P>
   <P>Yesterday the Governor sent me advice of the advanced Guard of the Rebels being within two
      Leagues and a half of the Main River, and desiring the Sloop might move higher up the River to
      keep a good look out on the Enemy. I therefore ordered Captain Mackenzie on that Service; he
      is within our Signals. </P>
   <P>All the Intelligence that I can learn from the Lieut. Governor is that <name>St John</name> surrendered
      themselves Prisoners of War on the 2d instant, and are to be sent to Harford [Hartford] in
      Connecticut, that General Carleton intended leaving Montreal, and has embarked in the Gaspee
      for that purpose. The Officer that commanded at Sorrell has likewise abandoned that Post. By a
      Battoe last night with Dispatches for the Lieut. Governor I am informed that Montreal is
      invested by the Rebels and must soon surrender, it being a Place of no Strength and in Want of
      Provisions; the Rebels are now in possession of Point Levi, which stops all Communication, and
      I am afraid the Town of Quebec will be invested in a short time. The Vessel waiting for my
      Dispatches prevents me from being more particular. I am Sir [&amp;c.] </P>

   <Title>NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL <name>SAMUEL GRAVES</name> 1</Title>
   <P>[Boston] Novr 9 1775 </P>
   <P>His Majesty's Ship Phoenix Captain Parker arrived from England; she had sailed from thence
      with a Convoy of Victuallers and two Ordnance Transports for Boston, all of which had parted
      from her on the Passage. The Nancy a Brig laden with Ordnance Stores was one of the Convoy. </P>
   <P>By the Phoenix the Admiral received Directions dated September 2d, to give Orders to the
      respective Captains and Commanders of his Majesty's Ships and Vessels under his Command
      &quot;to seize all Ships and Vessels belonging to New Hampshire, Massachusets Bay, Rhode
      Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pensylvania, the three lower Counties on Delaware,
      Maryland, Virginia North and South Carolina, or owned by the Inhabitants thereof, except only
      in cases where it should clearly appear, from their papers or from other evidence, that they
      were bound to or returning from some Port or place in Great Britain, Ireland, or his Majesty's
      Islands in the West Indies, but this Exception was not to extend, or be applied to such Ships
      or Vessels as might have Arms or Ammunition on board, which were to be seized in all Cases
      whatsoever, unless it should appear that the Arms and Ammunition had been shipp[ed] with
      license either from his Majesty in Counsil, from the Master General and Principal Officers of
      the Ordnance, or under the usual Clearances from the Commissioners of the Customs: and he was
      to cause all Ships and Vessels, which should be seized in the cases beforementioned, to be
      carried to some British Port, not within the twelve associated Colonies, and there detained
      'till further Orders, or be proceeded against according to Law, as the nature of the case
      should require. </P>
   <P>But, as by the above Order the Rebels might draw Supplies of Provisions, Rum, Melasses, Salt,
      Naval Stores, Cloathing, and in short every thing except Arms and Ammunition, from either
      Great Britain, Ireland or his Majesty's Islands in the West Indies; And as it would, if given
      to the Captains of the Kings Ships, invalidate those Orders from the Admiral, which they had
      long before acted under, to bring all Vessels laden with the Articles above enumerated to
      Boston: The Admiral thought proper to forbear carrying any part of it into Execution until he
      could receive their Lordships further Instructions thereon. Indeed the Clause directing
      Vessels seized to be carried &quot;to some British Port not within the twelve associated
      Colonies&quot; was almost impossible to be obeyed in the then State of things; for it would
      have employed half the force under the Admiral's Command to convoy the Prizes into Places of
      Security apart from the twelve associated Colonies. </P>
   <P>The Admiral also received by the Phoenix their Lordship's Orders dated September 7th to
      increase the Complements of the Ships of Twenty four and Twenty Guns and also of the Sloops
      The Ships by the addition of twenty, and the Sloops by the addition of ten Men each: And their
      Lordships Order July 14, 1775, to cause all Ships and Vessels to be examined for Letters, and
      to send to their Lordships all such as should contain any matter tending to aid, abet, or
      advise the rebellious proceedings of the Kings Subjects in North America. </P>
   <P>The Admiral was also acquainted by Mr Stephens in his Letter of July 24, with the Navy Board
      having Directions to send a flat bottomed Boat in each of the Vessels hired to bring
      Provisions for the Squadron and in a Letter of July 25, with the Names of the Ships which
      their Lordships had ordered out as a Reinforcement: that Rear Admiral Shuldham would proceed
      in the Chatham to serve under his Command; and that Captain Arbuthnot was appointed a
      Commissioner of the Navy to reside at Halifax for the better Superintendence of his Majesty's
      Naval Affairs in South [sic] America. In this last Letter were the following Words &quot;I
      have it in Command from their Lordships to acquaint you, by this opportunity, that they
      entirely approve of your Proceedings.&quot; </P>
   <P>By a Dispatch of August the 9th the Admiral was informed that the Navy Board was directed to
      cause twenty flat bottomed Boats to be sent to Boston by the Transport Vessels taken up to
      carry five Regiments of Foot from Ireland: and, by one of September 6th, that the Lizard
      convoyed the Jacob Store Ship with Arms and military Cloathing and Stores for Quebec, and the
      Liverpool the Maria Store Ship laden in like manner for Virginia; In which last Letter is the
      ensuing Paragraph, &quot;I have received and communicated to my Lords Commissioners of the
      Admiralty your Letters of the 16th and 18th of July, giving an Account of your Proceedings up
      to that time; and in return I have the satisfaction to acquaint you their Lordships very well
      approve thereof.&quot; </P>
   <P>By a Dispatch of September the 9th the Admiral was commanded to cause the men belonging to the
      Ships and Vessels seized and detained to be distributed amongst the Men of War to compleat
      their respective Complements, and to bear the Remainder as Supernumeraries until further
      Order. </P>
   <P>Intelligence having come by the Phoenix, that arrived the 9th of some Transports and
      Victuallers under her Convoy having parted from her, the Admiral, being apprehensive that
      these by droping in singly and unacquainted, might be in Danger of the Rebel Cruizers,
      immediately sent Orders to the Mercury, who was the same day come up to Boston, from her
      Cruize, to go out again and keep the Sea a Fortnight longer for their Protection. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Agreeable to the plan laid between you and General Clinton, the light Infantry of the Army
      under his Command, embarked on board the flatt bottom boats at Charlestown ferry, at Eleven
      o'Clock this morning under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel Clark.</P>
   <P>About twelve the Signal being made from the Scarborough the boats formed into two Divisions
      and landed on Phipp's Farm, abreast of where I lay, being led by Lieutenant Hutt of the
      Scarborough.</P>
   <P>Previous to the landing of the Troops I had placed your armed boat which carries two four
      pounders and six swivels, to flank a Causeway, which was occupied by a large body of the
      Rebels who were coming over to attack the Troops but upon her firing upon them, they
      immediately retired.</P>
   <P>As soon as the Troops had made good their landing, I sent a party of Seamen on Shore who
      brought off all the Cattle that was upon the Farm amounting to fourteen head.</P>
   <P>When the Troops were reembarking the Rebels appeared upon the Heights in great numbers and
      begun to fire upon the Troops, but they was soon dispersed by the Scarborough's cannon, and
      two field pieces that General Clinton had placed near the Mill on <name>Charles Town</name> side under the
      direction of Captain Drummond.</P>
   <P>At two o'Clock the Troops reembarked without the loss of a man either killed or wounded.</P>
   <P>As soon as the rear Guard got into the Boats I ordered your Armed Boat in Shore to bring up
      the rear and to fire at the Rebels if they should descend from the Heights, Mr Delgarno
      belonging to the Preston who Commanded her performed that Service very much like an Officer
      and was of great use in covering the Troops by keeping a very brisk fire.</P>

   <Title>DR. <name>BENJAMIN GALE</name> TO <name>SILAS DEANE</name> 1</Title>
   <P>Dear Sir, - </P>
   <P>Killingworth, 9th Nov., 1775.</P>
   <P>In your last you requested I would give you an account of the progress of our machine, and
      whether anything may be expected of it. I now sit down to give you a succinct but imperfect
      account of its structure, which is so complicated that it is impossible to give a perfect idea
      of it. </P>
   <P>The Body, when standing upright in the position in which it is navigated, has the nearest
      resemblance to the two upper shells of a Tortoise joined together. In length it doth not
      exceed 7 ½ feet from the stem to the higher part of the rudder: the height not exceeding 6
      feet. The person who navigates it enters at the top. It has a brass top or cover, which
      receives the person's head as he sits on a seat, and is fastened on the inside by screws. In
      this brass head is fixed eight glasses, viz. two before, two on each side, one behind, and one
      to look out upwards. In the same brass head are fixed two brass tubes, to admit fresh air when
      requisite, and a ventilator at the side to free the machine from the air rendered unfit for
      respiration. On the inside is fixed a Barometer, by which he can tell the depth he is under
      water; a Compass, by which he knows the course he steers. In the barometer and on the needles
      of the compass is fixed fox-fire, i.e. wood that gives light in the dark. His ballast consists
      of about 900 wt. of lead which he carried at the bottom and on th,e outside of the machine,
      part of which is so fixed as he can let run down to the Bottom, and serves as an anchor, by
      which he can ride ad libitum. He has a sounding lead fixed at the bow, by which he can take
      the depth of water under him; and to bring the machine into a perfect equilibrium with the
      water, he can admit so much water as is necessary, and has a forcing pump by which he can free
      the machine at pleasure, and can rise above water, and again immerge, as occasion requires. </P>
   <P>In the bow, he has a pair of oars fixed like the two opposite arms of a wind mill, with which
      he can row forward, and turning them the opposite way, row the machine backward; another pair
      fixed upon the same model, with which he can row the machine round, either to the right or
      left, and a third, by which he can row the machine either up or down; all which are turn'd by
      foot, like a spinning wheel. The rudder by which he steers, he manages by hand, within board.
      All these shafts which pass through the machine are so curiously fix'd as not to admit any
      water to incommode the machine. The magazine for the powder is carried on the hinder part of
      the machine, without board, and so contrived, that when he comes under the side of the Ship,
      he rubs down the side until he comes to the keel, and a hook so fix'd as that when it touches
      the keel it raises a spring which frees the magazine from the machine and fastens it to the
      side of the Ship; at the same time, it draws a pin, which sets the watchwork agoing which, at
      a given time, springs the lock .and the explosion ensues. </P>
   <P>Three magazines are prepared; the first, the explosion takes place in twelve, the second in
      eight, - the third in six hours, after being fixed to the ship. He proposes to fix these three
      before the first explosion takes place. He has made such a trial of the effects of the
      explosion of gunpowder under water, since Dr. [Benjamin] Franklin did me the honor to call
      upon me, as has exceeded his most sanguine expectations, and is now convinced his magazines
      will contain three times so much powder as is necessary to destroy the largest ship in the
      navy.2 </P>
   <P>I now write with the greater freedom, as I conclude by the time this reaches you the machine
      will be in camp. Lately he has conducted matters and his designs with the greatest secrecy,
      both for the personal safety of the navigator as to produce the greatest astonishment to those
      against whom it is designed, - if this projection succeeds, of which I make no doubt, as I
      well know the man and have seen the machine while in embryo, and every addition made to it
      fills me with fresh astonishment and surprize. And you may call me a visionary, an enthusiast,
      or what you please, - I do insist upon it, that I believe the inspiration of the Almighty has
      given him understanding for this very purpose and design. If he succeeds, a stipend for life,
      and if he fails, a reasonable compensation for time and expense is his due from the public. </P>
   <P>What astonishment it will produce and what advantages may be made by those on the spot, if it
      succeeds, is more easy for you to conceive than for me to describe.3 </P>
   <P>I congratulate you and my country in the begun success of our Arms to the northward, and the
      prospects of further success. Make my most respectful compliments to Dr. Franklin and our
      Delegates, your associates; and am, most respectfully Your sincere friend and most humble
      servt, </P>
   <P>Benjn Gale. </P>

   <P>2. In October 1787 <name>David Bushnell</name> wrote of his experiment to <name>Thomas Jefferson</name>, then Minister
      Plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris: </P>
   <P>The first experiment I made, was with about two ounces of gun powder, which I e){ploded 4 feet
      under water, to prove to some of the first personages in Connecticut, that powder would take
      fire under water. </P>
   <P>The second experiment was made with two pounds of powder, inclosed in a wooden bottle, and
      fixed under a hogshead, with a two inch oak plank between the hogshead and the powder; the
      hogshead was loaded with stones as deep as it could swim; a wooden pipe descending through the
      lower head of the hogshead, and through the plank, into the powder contained in the bottle,
      was primed with powder. A match put to the priming, exploded the powder, which produced a very
      great effect; rending the plank into pieces; demolishing the hogshead; and casting the stones
      and the ruins of the hogshead, with a body of water, many feet into the air, to the
      astonishment of the spectators. This experiment was likewise made for the satisfaction of the
      gentlemen above mentioned. </P>
   <P>I afterwards made many experiments of a similar nature, some of them with large quantities of
      powder; they all produced very violent explosions, much more than sufficient for any purpose I
      had in view. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Albany, 9th Nov. 1775.</P>
   <P>By all we can learn from <name>St. Johns</name>, we have the greatest reason to expect that matters will
      turn out well there. General Wooster is to proceed, or is already gone forward to take
      possession of Montreal. General Montgomery keeps <name>St. Johns</name> beseiged, and by the accounts of
      the prisoners, the regulars at <name>St. Johns</name> must have but little provisions, &amp;c. </P>
   <P>1. New York Provincial Congress, II, 99. Visscher was secretary of the Albancy Committee. </P>
   <Title>JOURNAL OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS 1</Title>
   <P>[Philadelphia] Thursday, November 9, 1775</P>
   <P>The Congress resumed the consideration of the report of the Committee appointed to consider
      the application from the Inhabitants of <name>Nova Scotia</name>,2 and after some debate, the same was
      postponed till to Morrow. </P>
   <P>1. Ford, ed., JCC, III, 343, 344.</P>
   <P>2. The Journal is silent as to when the report of the Committee, which had been appointed on
      November 2, was first presented. In the Adams Papers, MassHS, is a long memorandum headed
      &quot;Proposals.&quot; As <name>John Adams</name> was a member of the committee, it is evident that these
      &quot;Proposals&quot; constitute the report in question. It reads as follows: </P>
   <P>Proposals </P>
   <P>That two Battallions of Marines be raised consisting of one Coll, two Lt Colls, two Majors
      &amp;c (officers as usual in other Regiments) that they consist of five hundred Privates each
      Battalion, exclusive of officers. </P>
   <P>That particular Care be taken that no Person be appointed to office or inlisted into said
      Battalions but such as.have actually Served in the Merchant Service as seamen, or so
      acquainted with maritime Affairs as to be able to serve to advantage by sea, when required. </P>
   <P>That they be inlisted and commissioned to be held for and during the present war, between G.
      Britain and the Colonies, unless regularly dismissed by orders of the Congress </P>
   <P>That they be distinguished by the Name of the 1st and 2d Battalion of American Marines </P>
   <P>That a sufficient Number of Vessells be taken up, and provided at Newbury Port, or Portsmouth
      by the 1st day of December next for transporting said two Battalions and three Months
      Provisions, and other Necessaries. </P>
   <P>That said two Battalions be raised and marched to said Place of Rendezvous, by the 1st of
      December, and in Case they are not easily raised or there is likely to be delay, that the
      General Draught out of the Forces under his Command to make up, any such Deficiency, of those
      who have been employed at sea if such are to be had. </P>
   <P>That said Battalions shall be armed in the following Manner vizt a light Fusee, fitted for
      slinging - a large Hatchet with a long Handle - and a Spear, with thirty two Rounds per Man of
      Ammunition </P>
   <P>That a Number of Men be immediately sent into <name>Nova Scotia</name>, to inform themselves of the Temper
      and Disposition of the Inhabitants of that Colony with respect to the Present Struggle between
      G.B. and these Colonies, and how far they may be willing or able to take an active Part in the
      present Dispute. </P>
   <P>That two swift Sailing Boats be employed constantly to ply between Minas and Portsmouth or
      Newbury to bring Intelligence of the State and Situation of the Province, in general, but most
      minutley of every Thing, respecting the Town and Harbour of Hallifax </P>
   <P>That as soon as the said two Battalions, shall be arrived at either of said Ports and the
      situation of that Colony and the Town of Hallifax shall be known the said Battallions embark
      for Minas and make their Voyage with all possible Dispatch. </P>
   <P>That previous to their Ar[r]ival Horses and Carriages, be privately engaged for their Use, and
      that on their Landing they immediately make a forced March for Hallifax and possess themselves
      of that Town and of the naval and other Stores there and if practicable of the Shipping.</P>
   <P>Note. Coll Arnolds Expedition was supposed in Boston to have been against this Place, which
      caused the General to send thither Shipps, and Troops, but not enough to make Resistance to
      two such Battallions. further the Country are entirely in our favour, a few scotch Traders and
      renegade [Ichabod] Jones excepted. Should this Expedition by any Accident be found
      impra[c]ticable, these would be two Battallions of the Utmost service, being capable of
      serving either by sea or Land </P>
   <P>Should the Expedition succeed, the Consequences will be of the Utmost Importance, nothing less
      than the greatest Distress, if not the Utter Ruin of the ministerial Navy in America - the
      Naval Stores in that Place are said to be of such Value, the Docks and Barracks and yards cost
      the Nation more than one Million sterling, and is the only Place at which shipps of War can
      refitt in America. These Battalions should consist of Ten Companies each of fifty privates in
      a Company - the Reason for this is, that in fitting out any ship of War one of these Companies
      would compleatly man a small Vessell and two of them make a large Proportion of Marines for
      the largest.</P>
   <P>Should this Expedition succeed, which it most unavoidably will, if prudently managed, the
      Destruction of the Docks and Yards, and the stores, which may be brought off, will be an
      immense affair, and a Retreat can ever be made with Safty. But if a ship or two of Warr,
      should be taken, in the Harbour, of which you may be certain, and the Place by Reinforcements
      held, untill a force superiour can be brought from G.B. it will unavoidably destroy, and
      defeat any operation of our Enemy for the next Campaign, as all their Transport ships may by a
      few Armed Vessells from this Port be intercepted before they can have Intelligence to avoid
      them -</P>
   <Title>INSTRUCTIONS TO <name>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON</name>, ROBERT TREAT PAINE AND <name>JOHN LANGDON</name> 1</Title>
   <P>Gentlemen </P>
   <P>The Congress expect that you repair, with as much dispatch as the necessary preparation for
      your journey will admit, to Ticonderoga, in order to consult General Schuyler, what number of
      forces will be necessary in Canada and of the best and most efficacious method for procuring
      or continuing such forces in the Northern Department During the ensuing Winter, of engaging
      the inhabitants of the colony of Canada to accede to the association of the United Colonies
      and of protecting them for the future against their and our enemies </P>
   <P>If upon such a conference it shall be judged necessary You are authorized to direct Mr.
      Livingston the Deputy Commissary General to furnish the necessary Provisions for an Army of
      three thousand Men for Six Months </P>
   <P>You are also authorized to offer two Months pay as a bounty to such officers and soldiers as
      shall reenlist to be paid upon their taking the Fortress of <name>St Johns</name> and Montreal, and you are
      to make use of every argument to induce them to reenlist or at least to stay until they can be
      relieved, and to assure them that the Congress have taken care to supply them with proper
      cloathing </P>
   <P>You are to direct the fortresses at Ticonderoga and Crown Point to be put into such a posture
      of Defence as the State of our affairs may require. - You are to advise the General to
      Purchase of such officers and soldiers who have arms and are sick, their arms for the use of
      those who have none or bad ones and are well </P>
   <P>Ammunition it is hoped since the late capture will not be wanting; if it should the Congress
      will send the first that shall arrive </P>
   <P>If there should be occasion of re-enforcements you are impowered, in concert with General
      Schuyler to raise any number that can be procured in Canada, New York, or any of the New
      England governments in order to possess themselves of Montreal and Quebec </P>
   <P>The Congress desire you to exert your utmost endeavours to induce the Canadians to accede to a
      union with these Colonies and that they form from their Several Parishes a Provincial
      Convention and send delegates to this Congress. And as in the Present unsettled state of that
      country a regular election can hardly be expected, the Congress will acquiesce in the choice
      of Such Parishes and districts as are induced to join us. -</P>
   <P>You may and you are hereby empowered to assure them that we shall hold their rights as dear as
      our own, and on their Union with Us, exert our utmost endeavours to obtain for them and their
      Posterity the blessings of a free government and that Security to their Persons and Property
      which is derived from the British Constitution - </P>
   <P>And you may and are hereby empowered farther to declare that we hold sacred the rights of
      conscience and shall Never Molest them in the free enjoyment of their religion - </P>
   <P>In case General Schuyler has not yet raised the regiment recommended to him to be raised in
      Canada, or in case he cannot proceed to Canada you are to use all the means in Your Power to
      perfect the raising a Regiment of Canadians to join the Continental forces; and you are for
      that purpose to take with you blank Commissions, which, taking the advice of the General
      Officers in that Department, you are to fill up with the names of Such Persons as have the
      most merit and the best qualifications for the Service </P>
   <P>Congress direct you to acquaint General Schuyler that they approve of his appointment of Capt
      [David] Dimon to be a Brigade Major and have ordered him a Commission accordingly-</P>
   <P>The Congress moreover are desirous that you should take an accurate view of the state of our
      fortifications upon Hudsons river and make a report of it as soon as it can conveniently be
      done -</P>
   <P>If the circumstances of the Army should be such that a ton of Powder may be spared, you are to
      direct that quantity to be sent back to New York; and all such Cannon &amp; Military stores as
      shall not be wanted in Canada or in the fortifications on the Lakes to be sent to Albany,
      there to remain until Congress give further direction concerning them. And for this purpose
      you are herewith furnished with a list of the ordinance &amp; military stores which were at
      those places when taken - 2 </P>
   <P>You are to inform the General that the pay of some of the Officers is raised and to take with
      you from the Minutes the additional establishment - </P>
   <P>You are to Direct all such officers and soldiers as shall re-enlist to be paid all arrears
      that may be Due to them according to the rolls to be sent by Governor Trumbull, who in the
      mean time will be requested by Congress to send the rolls to the General ascertaining how long
      the men have been in the Service -</P>
   <P>The disposition of the Prisoners is approved of by the Congress; but the Officers are not to
      be permitted to reside in or near any Seaport </P>
   <P>You are authorized to assure Major Brown and Major Livingston that Congress have a just sense
      of their important services and will take the first proper opportunity to reward them </P>
   <P>You are also to acquaint the General that General Montgomery's request as to the pay of the
      company of Artillery by him appointed is complied with. </P>
   <P>A Committee will be appointed to procure as much hard Money as will be necessary to be
      transmitted to the Deputy Pay-Master General in the Northern Department to be used in Canada.

   <P>Before Lord Dunmore enclosed in his letter of 30 Novr 1775 </P>
   <P>1. US Revolution, LC.</P>
   <P>2. That Porter did not tell all, is evident in the narrative of <name>Luther Little</name>, who was a
      seaman on board the captured sloop. Little's account reads: </P>
   <P>After we had taken the powder and ball, and other articles for which we had orders, we
      proceeded on our return to North Carolina. The news of our expected arrival had been noised
      abroad, and the King's tender lay within the bar in wait for us. When we reached within a few
      miles of the bar, it became calm. Twelve pilot boats from Ocracoke came off to us, and
      informed us that the tender was coming out to take us. We loaded the twelve pilot boats with
      powder and they pushed off for Ocracoke, and arrived safe. The balls, which were in kegs, we
      hove overboard. By this time the tender made her appearance; it being calm, with their sweeps
      they rode alongside us, and ordered us all on board; made prize of the sloop, and ordered her
      to Norfolk, where lay the English fleet. The pilot on board the tender begged the Captain to
      discharge him. He refused, telling him he should keep him for a coasting pilot. He pleaded
      that he had a wife and eight children dependent on him, and begged hard for his release,
      which, through the influence of a lady on board, was finally granted. When the pilot and his
      crew went to take the boat, I mingled with them, and walked orderly on board without being
      observed, and immediately took one of the oars and went hard to rowing. The Captain and the
      rest of the crew were taken to Norfolk, prisoners. </P>
   <P>The pilot boat landed at Ocracoke, where I found that the pilots who took the powder ashore,
      had embezzled ten casks; which induced me to borrow an old musket, and keep guard over it that
      night .. I had eaten nothing the whole day; at ten in the evening I discovered a light in the
      woods about half a mile's distance. I directed my course, by a foot path, to the light. When J
      got near the house, a large dog issued from it, and jumped upon my shoulders, and I feared
      would have torn me in pieces. I tried to coax him, by patting him, but he still hung to my
      clothes, until I reached the door. There I knocked and called loudly; two women came to the
      door, who appeared the only inmates; they said it was a wonder the dog did not tear me to
      pieces. Here, for the first and last time in my life, I begged for something to eat. They gave
      me some hominy and milk, for which I was thankful. After requesting them to detain the dog
      until I was clear, I returned to the powder, which I faithfully guarded the remainder of the
      night. </P>
   <P>The next morning the pilots finding they could plunder no more of the powder, agreed to carry
      it up the Pamlico river, to the several County Committees for whom it was destined; myself
      accompanying them. We landed this powder in three Counties. I was invited by the several
      committees to take up my abode with them while I stayed; I gladly accepted their invitations,
      having left everything I had on board the sloop taken by the British. I stayed chiefly with
      the overseers of the plantations. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Charlestown, Nov. 9th, 1775. </P>
   <P>The late cruel cannonade of Bristol by the British ships of war, to enforce an arbitrary
      demand of sheep - the general depredations on the American coasts, by ministerial authority -
      the late advices from England of large military armaments by land and sea, for the hostile
      invasion of the Colonies upon this continent - and, the proclamation of the 23d of August
      last, at the Court of <name>St. James</name>', by which the good people of America are unjustly described
      as in avowed rebellion - superadded to the former American grievances - together, with Lord
      <name>William Campbell</name>'s threats of hostilities against us - have sunk deep in the minds of a people
      who, seeing themselves by the royal act, in effect put out of the regal protection, are at
      length driven to the disagreeable necessity of ordering a military opposition to the arms of
      the British ministry. But the people of South-Carolina remembering, that those who point the
      British arms at their breasts, and against their invaluable liberties, are their dear
      countrymen, and once were their friends; unwilling, yet determined, vigorously to oppose any
      approach of threatening danger to their safety; have directed me to intimate to you, Sir, as
      Commander in Chief of the British armament on this station, that orders are issued to the
      Commanding officer at <name>Fort Johnson</name>, by every military operation, to endeavour to prevent any
      ministerial armament from passing that post. </P>
   <P>We thus think it proper to warn you from an approach, that must be productive of the shedding
      of blood; which, in other circumstances, we would endeavour to preserve. I have the honour to
      be, Sir, [&amp;c.] </P>

      a seige - Their Lordships may depend on my Care &amp; Attention and ready Service to

   <Title>COMMISSIONERS FOR FORTIFICATIONS AT THE HIGHLANDS TO CAPTAIN BERNARD RoMANS 1</Title>
   <P>Sir-</P>
   <P>Martlers Rock, Nov. 10th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Your considerations on the conspicuous light you have been placed in at this post, your
      watchfulness for the interests of America as far as in your power lies, suppose you mean in
      the expense that must attend our present works, with the many et ceteras therein, we beg leave
      to make the following reply: </P>
   <P>1st. As to the erroneous distribution of 137 articifers and labourers at the post when you
      drew up your con'siderations, about 28 carpenters and 19 masons have come to this post since
      the 20th Octr. You arrived here the 10th, and think it would have been your duty to have let
      the commissioners know the proportion of labourers wanted to the artificers, before the
      addition of the latter were sent from New-York, and we do not recollect that even then you
      mentioned it; it has been latterly your complaint, on seeing the season advance, and our
      uneasiness that we had no place of any defence finished. To your judgment we submit what
      quantity of cubical feet of stone a mason properly attended may lay in twelve hours? We
      confess our ignorance in this calculation. But this we certainly are judges of, viz. If the
      work is well done, and the artificers keep close to it the proper time of working. The
      disappointment of one hundred men, expected up soon after we landed here, you are no stranger
      to. A proper attention should have been paid, in your mind, to the labourers that would
      necessarily be wanted frequently to unload timber, lime, brick, shingles and stores. </P>
   <P>2nd. In regard to your promise to build a block house in six weeks, with 6 hands and 2 oxen,
      you may perform; but rerriark, that your account of the number of carpenters and labourers
      employed on the one now nearly finished is certainly much exaggerated, as to the whole time
      since the 10th Oct. The carpenters not doing the work of it in a workmanlike manner you were
      to notice, and to have pointed out the most expeditious method, as we were frequently
      expostulating with you on the backwardness of our having some place of defence finished. As to
      oxen being cheaper than labourers to carry timber from the pierhead up to the heights of the
      rock where the block house is erected, may be just; but you know that when we began said block
      house we scarcely had a road up to it, from said pier, for men, then a cart was proposed to be
      drawn by labourers; a road was with great labour made for that, and a cart procured. About
      three weeks ago you proposed the hire of oxen, and three pair to be got directly; one pair was
      agreed to, and every step in our situation taken to get them. A letter was wrote to the
      committee of the Fishkills to assist us; a boat and people employed in messages to procure
      them. Three pair of oxen, or even one, ought to have bet;n provided with forage, (none being
      on this rock,) before they were brought to this place to be worked hard amongst rocks: this is
      not the work of a day where we are placed. Your calculation of the extra iron in lieu of
      trunnels may be just; but you will be pleased to observe, it was a case of absolute necessity,
      as you had never mentioned any thing of trunnels till they were wanted, and then informed us
      that nothing here was fit for such use, that only locust trunnels would answer; those not
      being to be got, after many applications up here, the block house could not be left waiting
      for them, as our orders from the Provincial Congress, dated the 28th September, was to get at
      least twelve guns directly mounted for defence, which you were made acquainted with on your
      return to this post, and frequently urged to get performed. </P>
   <P>3d. Your calculations of the expense of the block house, now near built, for this being the
      10th of November, it is not yet finished, we think not exact in many articles. Necessary iron,
      we believe, you will find to exceed your estimate. All that we have to say farther on this
      head, is, that we were of opinion, and told you so, that there was no necessity of making a
      temporary work have an elegant outside appearance, and the inside to be lined with so much
      nicety and expense. </P>
   <P>You say, with your method of bqilding and workmen, you would find you could build such a
      blockhouse for £176 9s. something less than half of what, by your estimate, you say the
      present one will cost. We should be glad to know who but yourself constructed, ordered, and
      particularly directed that building (except in the case of the iron bolts in lieu of
      trunnels.) Had the timber for it been ordered in pieces of length equal to the sides, instead
      of pieces of eighteen feet long, unwieldy for men to move and bring up on the rock, we should
      have had those pieces brought up with more despatch, and not have seen so great a waste of
      timber sawed from every piece, laying about the works; no trifling extraordinary expense this. </P>
   <P>4th. We are at a loss to conceive what you mean by - amongst other bad regulations - one, and
      that grievously against sound policy, has taken place here, respecting some special marks of
      favour shewn (by us, suppose that is your meaning,) to the country carpenters, above the [New]
      York carpenters. Now we request you would point out this special mark of favor? Sure we are,
      that the country carpenters have not been so comfortably accomodated as the others, having no
      fireplace to this day, November 10th, to go to, and according to your own confession they are
      the most faithful workmen. We have always understood that it was both just and sound policy to
      reward merit; we have rather been deficient in this to those deserving men. If you had heard
      any unreasonable murmurs from the York carpenters, why was it kept from us? As a proper
      inquiry might have been made, and if unjust murmurs, the persons guilty should been discharged
      from the service. </P>
   <P>The rest of this long carpenters' affair we shall leave, thanking you for your advice at the
      conclusion, which we think would be very impolitic in these times to put into execution. </P>
   <P>5thly. As the oxen are again introduced with an estimate of the difference of twenty men's
      labour, and two oxen with the teamster one day in which you make a balance of £5 8s. Od. in
      favour of oxen. But you have forgot that this one teamster cannot put on a stick of timber 12
      in. by 12, eighteen feet long on the carriage by himself, nor put it down when at the place
      wanted. We have had a pretty good sample this day in the oxen carrying off stone, when six men
      were employed to put the stone on and support it all the way to where it was thrown off. We
      are apprehensive your calculations of the cost of hay and corn for two oxen, four months is
      below the mark, as we will soon be convinced of. However, on the whole, we join with you in
      the necessity of having them at this place, and that a vast saving will be made by using such.
      The reason why they were not procured sooner we have already mentioned. </P>
   <P>6thly. In regard to the erroneous principle you say our labourers are hired on, you may be
      very right in, could it have been carried into execution on our first coming here (if you had
      then mentioned it), which is some doubt with us as the times are. </P>
   <P>7thly. The superficial views you say you took of the ground when you first came up here was a
      great error. It should have been minutely examined to have made a proper estimate of works to
      be erected here. As to the estimate, you never favoured us with it, we wish you had, it might
      have been of some service then, it can be of little now, amongst your considerations presented
      to us. All the necessary tools, wheel-barrows, &amp;c. brought to this post were procured
      without any direction from you. In your estimate of the expenses of the barracks and stores
      you have forgot glass for the windows, iron, the freight of boards and shingles, unless the
      freight of the two latter articles are included in your incidental requisites. </P>
   <P>8thly. As to the article of not being able to do without miners is a doubt with us, we,
      however, submitted to some being employed for taking away a large part of a rock to the NW. of
      the block house, although powder was scarce with us and not sent up for such service, twenty
      odd weight of which has been already expended. We are satisfied to have two miners employed
      for the purpose of taking away rocks that can not be removed without, as soon as we have
      powder sent up for that service, which we have applied for; but to have four employed to blast
      stone for the works we presume would be very expensive indeed, as stone enough can be procured
      all around us and brought with the team to the works. When after a blast is made the large
      pieces are to be worked upon by labourers with mauls to make them portable. </P>
   <P>9thly. On what view you have interfered with the steward's office you best know, in your
      directions about delivering out the provisions. We know what provisions are received, what
      number of hands every day to be victualled, and he keeps an account of provisions expended. If
      it has proceeded from a suspicion that more provisions may be delivered out than is necessary,
      by which an extraordinary expence will arise. We wish you would consider how often we have
      requested you to send from this post your negro which we now insist on, who is a nuisance, and
      has caused more dissatisfaction amongst the people than ever we could learn from any
      particular favour shown to the country carpenters, Your addition of a clerk for yourself is an
      officer we can by no means allow of, and for the above reason desire if you retain him, to pay
      and provide provision for him at your own expense. You cannot have forgot when you recommended
      Mr. Vandome to Messrs. [Samuel] Bayard [William] Bedlow and [John] Hanson, that he was to
      assist you in your writing. </P>
   <P>10thly. As to the number of unwelcome guests we so frequently have had, you know it has never
      met with our approbation and have frequently informed the Provincial Congress of the
      impropriety of suffering it. </P>
   <P>Lastly. As to your entreaty to make the necessary alterations you have recommended in your
      conclusion, we think the above a sufficient reply, and could any alteration in this advanced
      season of the year take place to advance the fortification, no persons would more gladly
      embrace them to further the public service we are engaged in, as we think ourselves as much
      interested to do it in the rank the Honble Provincial Congress of this Province have placed us
      in, as possibly you can be. We know the power we are invested with, and will be glad to see
      you not interrupt them by assuming the sole direction in every thing here. Upon the whole we
      assure you, sir, we have no other desire than to treat you as a gentleman who has an important
      trust comitted (with us) to your charge; therefore, to avoid every thing that should interrupt
      that harmony that ought to subsist among persons employed in the cause of American liberty, do
      desire that when you want to have any piece of work done we may come together and consult
      about it, that we may approve or not. We are, sir, [&amp;c.] </P>

      and transports there belonging to the enemy. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That two Battalions of marines be raised, consisting of one Colonel, two Lieutenant

      required: that they be inlisted and commissioned to serve for and during the present war
      between Great Britain and the colonies, unless dismissed by order of Congress: that they be

      by the rifle guard stationed at that place; upon which they immediately tacked about, and made
      for the ship. The ship and tenders then began a heavy cannonading, and one six-pounder went
      through the storehouse at the water-side; many of the shot likewise hit the ferry-house, in
      which was a large family. Providentially, however, no person was hurt, either then, or about
      three hours afterwards, when they began a second cannonading, and fired - three or four

   <P>The Secretary, as Chairman of the Committee of Observation, reported, that in consequence of
      the late correspondence between the Congress and Capt. Thornbrough, of his Majesty's sloop
      Tamer, and some information laid before the Congress, by <name>Jonathan Scott</name>, Esq; he had thought
      it his duty, and did, last Tuesday evening [November 7], cause all the fishing boats to be
      stopt from proceeding beyond <name>Fort Johnson</name>; as he observed, that instead of avoiding, they
      mostly went in the way of the men of war, and were frequently along-side - and that he had

      coasters, and persons desirous of going into the Road, lest in one case, a seizure of the
      schooners should ensue, according to Capt. Thornbrough's threat; and in the other, an improper

   <P>I was afterwards sent with the prisoners taken with me to an armed vessel in the river, which
      lay off against Quebec, under the command of Capt. M'Cloud, of the British, who treated me in
      a very generous and obliging manner, and according to my rank; in about twenty-four hours, I
      bid him farewell with regret; but my good fortune still continued. - The name of the captain
      of the vessel I was put on board, was Littlejohn; who, with his officers, behaved in a polite,
      generous and friendly manner. I lived with them in the cabin, and fared on the best, my irons
      being taken off, contrary to the order he had received from the commanding officer; but
      Captain Littlejohn swore, that a brave man should not be used as a rascal, on board his

      Capt. Littlejohn and his officers, I was obliged to bid him farewell, parting with them in as
      friendly a rnanner as we had lived together, which, to the best of my memory, was the eleventh
      of November: when a detachment of Gen. [Colonel] Arnold's little army appeared on point Levi,
      opposite Quebec, . . . I was then taken on board a vessel c;alled the Adamant, together with
      the prisoners taken with me, and put under the power of an English merchant from London, whose
      name was <name>Brooke Watson</name>: a man of malicious and cruel disposition, and who was probably
      excited, in the exercise of his malevolence, by a junta of tories, who sailed with him to
      England; along whom were Col. <name>Guy Johnson</name>, Col. Closs, and their attendants and associates, to
      the number of about thirty. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P><name>Cambridge Novr</name>. 11th. 1775</P>
   <P>I had the Honour to address myself to you the 8th. Inst by Capt. Macpherson, since which I
      have an Account of a Schooner laden chiefly with Fire-Wood being brought into Marblehead by
      the armed Schooner Lee Capt Manly. She had on Board, the Master, a Midshipman, two Marines,
      and four Sailors from the Cerberus Man of War, who had made a Prize of this Schooner a few
      Days before, and was sending her into Harbour. 2 </P>
   <P>Inclosed you have a Copy of an Act passed this Session by the Honble Council &amp; House of
      Representatives of this Province. It respects such Captures, as may be made by Vessels fitted
      out by the Province, or by Individuals thereof.3 As the armed Vessels fitted at the
      Continental Expence do not come under this Law, I would have it submitted to the Consideration
      of Congress to point out a more summary Way of proceeding to determine the Property and Mode
      of Condemnation, of such Prizes as have been, or hereafter may be made, than is specified in
      this Act. </P>
   <P>Should not a Court be established by Authority of Congress, to take Cognizance of Prizes made
      by the Continental Vessels? Whatever the Mode is which they are pleased to adopt, there is an
      absolute Necessity of its being speedily determined on; for I cannot spare Time from military
      Affairs to give proper Attention to these Matters. The Inhabitants of Plymouth have taken a
      Sloop laden with Provisions &amp;c. from Halifax bound to Boston, and the Inhabitants of
      Beverly, have, under Cover of one of the armed Schooners, taken a Vessel from Ireland, laden
      with Beef, Pork, Butter, &amp;c. for [the] same place.4 The Latter brings Papers &amp; Letters
      of a very interesting Nature, which are in the Hands of the Honble Council, who informed me
      they will transmit them to you by this Conveyance. To the Contents of these Papers and
      Letters, I must beg Leave to refer you and the Honble Congress, who will now see the absolute
      Necessity there is of exerting all their Wisdom to withstand the mighty Efforts of our
      Enemies. </P>
   <P>The Trouble I have in the Arrangement of the Army is really inconceivable. Many of the
      Officers sent in their Names to serve in Expectation of Promotion. Others stood aloof to see
      what Advantage they could make for themselves, whilst a Number who have declined, have again
      sent in their Names to serve. So great has the Confusion arising from these, and many other
      perplexing Circumstances been, that I found it absolutely impossible to fix this very
      interesting Business exactly on the Plan resolved .on in Conference, tho I have kept up to the
      Spirit, as near as the Nature &amp; Necessity of the Case would admit of. The Difficulty with
      the Soldiers is as great, indeed more so, if possible, than with the Officers. They will not
      inlist until they know their Col:, Lieut. Col, Major, Capt. &amp;c so that it was necessary to
      fix the Officers the first Thing, which is, at last, in some Measure done, &amp; I have given
      out inlisting Orders. You, Sir, can much easier judge, than I can express the Anxiety of Mind
      I must labour under on this Occasion, especially at this Time, when we may expect the Enemy
      will begin to act, on the Arrival of their Reinforcement, Part of which is already come, and
      the Remainder daily dropping in. I have other Distresses of a very alarming Nature. The Arms
      of our Soldiery are so exceedingly bad, that I assure you, Sir, I cannot place a proper
      Confidence in them. Our Powder is wasting fast, notwithstanding the strictest Care, Oeconomy,
      &amp; Attention, are paid to it. The long Series of wet Weather we have had, renders the
      greater Part of what has been served out to the Men, of no Use. Yesterday I had a Proof of it;
      as a Party of the Enemy, about four or five Hundred, taking the Advantage of a high Tide,
      landed at Lechmore's Point, which at that Time was in Effect an Island. We were alarmed, and
      of course ordered every Man to examine his Cartouch box, when the melancholy Truth appeared,
      &amp; we were obliged to furnish the greater Part of them with fresh Ammunition. The Damage
      done at the Point, was the Taking off a Man, who watched a few Horses and Cows - two of the
      latter were carried off. Col. [William] Thompson marched down with his Regiment of Rifle-men,
      and was joined by Col. [Benjamin Ruggles] Woodbridge with a Part of his, and a Part of [John]
      Patterson's Regiment, who gallantly waded thro' the Water, and soon obliged the Enemy to
      embark under Cover of a Man of War, a floating Battery, and the Fire of a Battery on
      Charles-Town Neck. We have two or our Men dangerously wounded by Grape Shot from the Man of
      War; and by a Flag out this Day, we are informed the Enemy lossd two of their Men. 5 I . have

   <P>Your favor of the 9 Inst to his Excellency came this morning to hand - As the people object to
      your taking charge of the Schooner from Ireland, 2 &amp; as having any thing to do with
      Vessels brought in as the North Briton was, will give both you and the General trouble, It is
      his advice that you will have nothing to do with such by any authority under his Excellency -
      By what <name>Col Glover</name> Informs us, Capt Manly has a claim on this Schooner, in that case you have
      an undoubted right to take possession of her; you must be a better judge of this matter being
      on the spot, than we possibly can. If it }s clear to you that Manly's claim is a just one, it
      must be prosecuted: If it is not very apparent, dont you Trouble yourself or the General with
      a Litigious dispute - I wish you could get rid of the Trouble you must have with the Cargo by
      the <name>North Britton</name>. Suppose you was to give it Vessel &amp;c up to the Committee of Safety? In
      Short get rid of the Trouble in the best manner you can, &amp; Let us hear nothing further
      thereon. I hope for some good Captures by the Armed Schooners will pay you for the plague you
      must have had. That the agency for the Continental Vessels may be very beneficial to you, is

   <P>Sir </P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> November 11, 1775.</P>
   <P>I have received by the Viper your Letter October 18, with a Letter from Governor Tryon and Mr
      [David] Mathews 2 inclosed, giving me an Account of your having apprized Captain Wallace at
      Rhode Island of the Rebels intention of conveying Cloathing and dry Goods through the Sound to
      New London, to supply their Army. It was a proper Precaution and I hope Captain Wallace will
      contrive to prevent their Scheme taking Effect. I had the same information from another
      Quarter, and had also sent it to Captain Wallace, but it was not so early as yours. I very
      much pity Governor Tryons Situation, and think with you he had better take up his abode on
      board the Asia until he can reside on shore with Security, for the Magistracy of the City
      however disposed are not in a condition to protect him.</P>
   <P>The Philadelphians will no doubt try every method to prevent the Kings Ships coming to the
      City. I have a description of the Triangles, and of the Boats constructed to guard the River,
      but I hope to shew them next Spring we can surmount every difficulty to chastize such an
      ungrateful Set of People. The Refusal of the third Regiment to submit to the Orders of the
      Congress and military Discipline hath an exceeding good Aspect. I hope the example will be
      followed, and then we cannot fail of Success.</P>
   <P>I inclose an Order to discharge Bicker, upon the Information you have transmitted, and all
      things considered I think it would be unjust to detain him any longer, but as to <name>Ensign Tyley</name>
      [<name>Edward Tilley</name>] his Recommendation is sufficient to authorize his detention, therefore he
      shall have a Voyage to England. What is become of Captain [Samuel] Holland and his Officers on
      the Survey? I observe you mention that his most valuable Draughts are sent home, but he must
      notwithstanding have many Articles remaining of too great Consequence to fall into the hands
      of an ignorant, infatuated Mob. If you can get a Line to him, let him know that I would not
      have him put too much Confidence in the Perth Amboyans, and desire him to place what he wishes
      to preserve on board you. </P>
   <P>You have no doubt gained a good deal of information respecting Hudsons River, where the Passes
      are, the distance from each other, when the Navigation is generally open, it's Depth of Water,
      how far navigable for Ships and other Vessels, what landing Places are on its Banks, what
      Number of Vessels are in the River, their Size, how rigged and navigated? I shall be glad to
      receive what Intelligence you can procure respecting the whole or any part of the aforegoing
      Queries; and every necessary information respecting the other Rivers you can get, and shall be
      obliged to you to purchase for me a good Chart of the River as high up as possible. The
      Phoenix or some other Ship will very soon relieve you, and bring Orders for your proceeding to
      England; therefore collect and commit to writing every intelligence necessary to be given to
      Captain Parker, that after his Arrival you may get away without being delayed. </P>
   <P>All your Marines are to be left behind, your Swivel Guns and the Stores belonging to them,
      Your Moaring Swivel, and every thing that can be useful to the Phoenix or smaller Ships, and
      the Asia can spare; but Captain Parker on his Arrival will give you particular Orders about
      these things. Remember to send me Copies of such Intelligence as you leave with your
      Successor; and as I am resolved upon having the Phoenix and Viper this Winter at New York, I
      would have you facilitate this Matter as much as lies in your power before Captain Parkers
      Arrival, by getting the best Pilots for him, and discovering a Situation least exposed to
      Danger by Ice, where he can at once fix himself. I am &amp;c </P>

   <P>By the Orders and Instructions now sent you will learn that his Majesty is firmly resolved to
      reduce the Colonies to obedience; I therefore desire you will steadily and vigorously pursue
      every means in your power for that purpose. Let me know what Sort of Ships you would have, how
      many more, and in general every thing that you can desire to carry on your Operations against
      the Rebels; Endeavour by all means to secure the possession of Rhode Island free from Irrup
      tions from the Continent, let no method be left untried. The Ports within the Sound must be
      destroyed if possible, and the Stock on the Islands round you preserved. I know this is an
      arduous task; but I likewise know that whatever is possible to be done you can effect; take
      every opportunity of getting Cattle for us, for our existence this Winter depends on Supplies
      of fresh Provisions for the People. If you can procure Potatoes, Turnips, Carrots, whether by
      Ravage or Purchase, send them here, I will supply all the Seamen with Roots or Vegetables if
      they can be had. I repeat my Reliance upon your Activity and Zeal for the Kings Service, and I
      desire if I have omitted to send you any Supplies or Directions that you will poi!1t it out to
      me with any Observations tending to the good of the Service. I am &amp;c </P>

   <P>2. Ibid., I, 165, BM; [Graves's note] &quot;By the foregoing Letters and various others a
      little before and after this Period (in the Appendix), it will appear how anxious and alert
      the Admiral was on the prospect of an effectual Reinforcement and the receipt of positive
      Orders from Home. His Ships were kept cruizing under many difficulties in all Weathers, their
      Commanders received frequent and full directions for their Conduct; every method was tried to
      annoy the Enemy and to secure New York &amp; Rhode Island, as places of the greatest
      importance; Convoys were always ready at the shortest Notice, and every assistance given that
      was practicable to the Army, insomuch that no Stratagem was left unessayed to provide the
      Garrison with provisions and fuel for the Winter. And here it may not be improper to recall
      the Readers Observation that all the several Directions given by the Admiral in consequence of
      the Rebellion until the arrival of the Raven on the 4th of October issued from himself without
      the least instruction from Administration that he constantly anticipated the Orders of
      Government by his foresight of Exigencies &amp; that now he ventured at his own peril, &amp;
      for the sake of the public, to disobey the Admiralty Orders brought by the Phoenix.&quot; </P>

   <P>[Plymouth, November 11, 1775] 2</P>
   <P>The British quartered in Boston began soon to suffer much from the scarcity of provisions, and
      General Washington took every precaution to prevent their gaining a supp'y - from the country
      all supplies could be easily cut off, and to prevent their receiving any from Tories and other
      disaffected persons by water, the General found it necessary to equip two or three armed
      vessels to intercept them; among these was the brigantine Washington of 10 guns, commanded by
      capt. Martindale - as seamen at this time could not easily be obtained, as most of thein had
      enlisted in the land service, permission was given to any of the soldiers who should be
      pleased to accept of the offer, to man these vessels - consequently myself with several others
      of the same regiment went on board the Washington, then lying at Plymouth, and in complete
      order for a cruize. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Tyonderoga November 11th 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>I did Myself the Honor to address You on the 7th instant, Since which I have received No
      Advices from General Montgomery, I believe he left <name>St Johns</name> on the sixth with the whole Army
      in Order to attempt Montreal, and from what I have been able to learn from the Prisoners, he
      has the greatest Prospect of reaping Fresh Laurels. - </P>
   <P>Colo: Arnold was not arrived at the <name>St Lawrence</name> on the 30th Ult., I am apprehensive that he
      suffers much from the Length of his March, Unforsoon Difficulties &amp; bad Weather. -</P>
   <P>We have already had snow here &amp; I fear that the Earth in Canada, is covered with It, a
      very trying Situation for an Army so very deficient in Clothing as ours is. I feel so much for
      them in their unhappy Situation, destitute of every Necessary to guard against the Inclemency
      of the Season, that I have ventured to desire <name>Genl Montgomery</name> to purchase Clothing for all
      those who will remain in the Service; When I gave this Order I had not forgot that You had
      conveyed Me the Resolution of Congress &quot;That they would endeavour to attend to the
      Cloathing of the Troops,[&quot;] but the Necessity was so pressing, that a Delay mig[ht] have
      proved Fatal to Us &amp; which I hope will be a sufficient Excuse for my Presumption. - </P>
   <P>Inclose You a Return of the Officers that were made Prisoners at <name>St Johns</name>, that of the Men is
      mislaid but I think they' exceed four hundred exclusive of the Canadians. - </P>
   <P>The 7th &amp; 26th are on their March to Connecticut the Canadian Officers wait the Arrival of
      their Bagga[ge] &amp; I propose sending them to Trentown, I am much at a Loss what to do with
      the Canadian Privates, they are almost naked &amp; beg hard to return to their Families, I
      have wrote to General Montgomery on the Subject, If they are to be kept, there will be a
      Necessity of Clothing them. -</P>
   <P>The Officers of the 7th &amp; 26th applied to me for Blankets &amp; Shoes for their Men, who
      are almost barefooted. I have no such Articles here &amp; If I had I should not have thought
      Myself Justifiable in giving them, as We are in great Want Ourselves; - They then asked Money,
      &amp; I have ventured to give Major <name>Preston One</name> hundred and seventy two pounds six Shillings
      New York Currency as much to Capt: Kinnear who commanded the seventh, To Capt: Godwin of the
      Artillery forty Pounds six to the Officers with Major Stopford about Eighty Pounds; I thought
      It best that they should supply themselves especially as they consider themselves accountable
      to me for the Money. -</P>
   <P>... And our affairs wear so favorable an Aspect in Canada, that if Colo: Arnold should
      penetrate to Quebec, the whole Country will in all Probability be in our Hands soon. An Event
      that will doubtless be attended with the most salutary Consequences to the Colonies provided
      we can keep our Ground in that Province the ensuing Campaign. I shall therefore venture, to
      descend a little more into Particulars, &amp; to give you my Opinion of What may be necessary
      in this Quarter; But I assure you Sir, that I do this with the greatest Diffidence &amp;
      Defference to the better Judgment of Congress. -</P>
   <P>Three Thousand Men I conceive would not be too many to remain in Canada this Winter One of
      these at Quebec, Another at Montreal, five hundred at Trois Reiviers, as being the Principal
      Places in that Country, the Remaining five hundd at Chambly &amp; <name>St Johns</name>, but the Season is
      so far advanced that Necessity will oblige Congress to be content with such Numbers out of the
      Army now there as can be prevailed upon to stay, but why so large a Body of Troops, when
      Nothing is to dread'd this Winter? It will confirm the Canadians of the Opinion they begin to
      entertain of the Strength of the Colonies, an Opinion which should be carefully cultivated,
      that they may act with Vigour &amp; Spirit next Year against the Attacks which will in all
      Probability take Place early in the Spring, as the Regular Troops which will then be in
      America, can be easily conveyd to Quebec. And they ought also to be on the Spot in order to
      repair the Fortifications (which I am informed want it much) as soon as the Winter gives Way. </P>
   <P>The Command in Canada should be given to a prudent and active Officer &amp; one that has
      Talents to conciliate the Affections of that People. None More equal to the Task, than the
      Gentleman who now Commands the Army there, if he will remain. </P>
   <P>But as three thousand Men may not be sufficient even with the Aid of the Canadians, on whom it
      may be prudent not to place too much Dependance, to resist a Vigorous Attack, a Number of
      Batteaus should be constructed here in Addition to those we have sufficient to convey a large
      Body of Men into Canada when ever it may be found necessary. - I believe one hundred will be
      sufficient, Every thing should be prepared this Winter for Building these Batteaus, a Quantity
      of Provisions &amp; Stores should be carryed to <name>Fort George</name>. -</P>
   <P>The proper Places for erecting Batteries on the <name>St Lawrence</name> above Quebec should be determined
      on and such Craft constructed as will prevent Armed Vessels from coming up, should the
      Garrison of Quebec be unable to resist the Force that may be brought against It. -</P>
   <P>Every Military Department in this Quarter should be put on a proper Footing and widely
      different from what it is at present, at once to save Expence &amp; that the Service may be
      carryed on with that Order, the Want of which in this Campaign, the Country will feel in the
      Extra-Expence and Your Commanders have experienced with Pain, Nor will their Successors have
      fewer difficulties to encounter U[nless] such Regulations are adopted as have a Tendency [to]
      promote good Order, Subordination, Discipline &amp; Oecono[my,] For the Bulk of Mankind,
      whatever their Principles may be, forget to act up to them, when it is most necessary that
      they should not deviate from them. </P>
   <P>I am Building ten Sleds to be employd At the Saw Mills in Drawing Oak Timber for the Bottoms
      &amp; Garboard Streaks of Batteaus, or in Conveying the Cannon from hence to Canada or to
      Hudsons River or in Drawing Ffre wood for the Garrisons, the Season is so far advanced, that I
      could not wait for the Sanction of Congress &amp; have therefore sent to Canada for twenty
      Horses, which are much cheaper there than with Us. -</P>
   <P>At each of the lower Ferries on Hudson's River, above Albany there are two Boats, the two
      Uppermost have only one &amp; they are small &amp; worn out, so that the Detention of the
      Provisions &amp; Baggage causes not only a very considerable Expence, but retards the Service.
      this Evil might be guarded against by Building four Good Scows like those on Schuyl-Kill
      [River] &amp; have them managed by Soldiers picked for that Purpose, and I believe the Expence
      will hardly exceed that of the Ferriage we now Pay, should Congress approve of Building these,
      they will please to order two Shipwrights up, who know the Construction, the soonest possible
      that the Timber may be procured &amp; the Boats if possible built in the Winter. I am Sir

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Wmsburg Novr. the 11th. [1775]</P>
   <P>Col. Woodford offered to go and take the Command of all the Forces which were there [Hampton]
      or might be called in. With the Assistance of waggon Horses and rnch as were lent by the
      Gentlemen of the Town the Col., Captn. Bluford [<name>Abraham Buford</name>] and his Rifle Company were
      enabled to reach Hampton about 7 O'Clock A.M. [October 27.] They rode through an incessant and
      heavy Rain. When the Col. entered the Town, having left the Rifle Men in the Church to dry
      themselves he rode down to the River took A view of the Town, and then seeing the Six Tenders
      at Anchor in the River went to Col. Cary's to dry himself and eat his Breakfast. But before he
      could do either the Tenders had cut their Way through the Vessel's Boltsprit which was sunk to
      impede their Passage and having a very fresh and fair Gale had anchored in the Creek and
      abreast of the Town. The People were so astonished at their unexpe[cted] and sudden Arrival
      that they stood staring at them and omitt[ed] to give the Col. the least Notice of their
      approach. The first Intelligence he had of this Affair was from the Discharge of a 4 Pounder.
      He mounted his Horse and riding down to the Warf found that the Peop[le] of the Town had
      abandoned their Houses andthe Militia had left the Breast Work which had been thrown up across
      the Wharf and Street. He returned to order down Captn. Nicholas's Company and Bluford's and
      meeting Nicholas's, which had been encamped near Col. Car[y's] he lead them pulling down the
      Garden Pails through Jones's Garden under Cover of his House, and lodged them in the House
      directing them to fire from the Window which they did with great Spirit. He then returned and
      lead Bluford's Company in the same manner under Cover of Houses on the other Side of the
      Street placing some in a House and others at a Breast Wark on the Shore. Here he found the
      Militia had crowded in, and incommoded the Rifle me[n] He therefore ordered them off and
      stationed them with Captn. Lynes on the back of the Town to prevent a surprise, by an Attack
      of Regulars who it was said had landed at Back water. Captn. Barron with the Town Militia and
      Part of Nicholas's Company were stationed at the Breast Work on the Wharf and across the
      Street. The Fire was now general and constant on both Sides. Cannon Balls Grape Shot and
      Musket Balls whistled over the Heads of our Men, Whilst our Muskets and Rifles poured Showers
      of Balls into. their Vessels and they were so well directed that the Men on Board the Schooner
      in which Captn. Squires himself commanded, were unable to stand to their 4 Pounders which were
      not sheltered by a Netting, and gave but one Round of them but kept up an incessant firing of
      smaller Guns and swivels, as did 2 Sloops and 3 Boats for more than an Hour and ¼, when they
      slipt their Cables and towed out except the Hawk Tender a Pilot Boat they had taken some Time
      before from a Man of Hampton, which was taken. In her they found 3 wounded Men 6 Sailors and 2
      Negros. Liutent. Wright who commanded her had been forced to jump over Board and was attended
      to the Shore by 2 Negros and a white Man, one of the Negros was shot by a Rifle Man across the
      Creek at 400 yds. distance. If Col. Woodford's Men whom he had ordered rou[nd] to the Creeks
      Mouth could have got there soon enough they would undoubtedly have taken the little Squadron,
      for the Sailors could not possibly have towed them through their Fire. Although the nearest of
      the Tenders was 3 Hundred Yds. and the farthest about 450 from our Me[n,] yet our Fire was
      [so] well directed that the Sailor[s] were not able to stand to their Guns and serve them
      pr[operly] but fir[ed] them at Random at an Unaccountable Degree of Elevation. The same
      Squadron came up Jas. River some Days after [November 1] and attempted to land at Jas. Town
      but were prevented by about [<gap/>] Rifle men and as many Country People who happened to be
      there. A few Rifle Balls con[... ] the 34 Four Pounders with Which our Ea[rs] were saluted.
      Our Men brought up a 4 lb [Ball.] And yesterday the King Fisher and 3 Large Tenders-(which had
      come up to B----s [Burwell's] Ferry to prevent the Passage of our 2d. Regiment and the
      Culpep[er] Batalion which were ordered down to Norfo[lk] fired on a Vessel at the Ferry
      Landing order[ing] her to come along side, but our Rifle men stationed there ordered the
      Skipper to stay where he was. The Vessel lay about 3 Hundred Yds. from our Men and about ¾
      Mile from the Man of War, which began to fire on her, and finding that her Shot had no Effect
      sent off a Barge full of Men to take her, but as soon as the Barge had got within a small
      Distance of the Vessel the Riflemen fired and say they killed three Men. However it be, the
      Barge put back and then made a 2d Attempt which was defeated in the same Manner except that
      the Rifle[men] say they killed but one man the 2d. Time. The Man of War fired many 6 Pounders
      at our Men however but 2 of them struck near them. One went through a Stone House and the
      other lodged.in the Bank over the Heads of our Men which they dug out and sent by Captn. Green
      to Col. Henry. I can assure you that about 20 Rifle Men have disputed witp the Man of War and
      her Tenders fbr this Vessel 2 Days and they have hitherto kept her and the Ferry Boats safe,
      which it is supposed they wish to burn. It is incredible how much they dread a Rifle. Before
      the Man of War had come up the River, 250 of our Men had crossed over with their Baggage. The
      Remainder are to join them as soon as possible either by venturing over before the Enemies
      [Faces?] or by passing over higher up. </P>
   <P>The People at Norfolk are under dreadful Apprehensions of having their Town burnt by this
      Detachment. They know they deserve it, but we seem to be at a Loss what to do with them. Many
      of them deserve to be ruined and hanged but others again have acted dastardly for Want of
      Protection. But at all Events rather than the. Town should be garrisoned by our Enemies and a
      Trade opened for all the Scoundrels in the Country, we must be prepared to destroy it. If we
      had but Salt enough to satisfy our Country Men who begin to complain for want of it, and Arms
      and Ammunition, we should be able to make a very good Stand against all the Forces that can be
      sent to Virginia, for I can assure you notwithstanding the Affair of Norfolk and Kemps
      Landing, Your Country Men are brave and hearty in the Cause. </P>
   <P><name>John Page</name> </P>
   <P>P.S. I have just seen the K---s Proclamation. I forgot to mention that Yesterday a Man came to
      the Camp and said that Captn. Montag[u] desired to speak with one of our Officers, and sa[id]
      he would come ashore, or receive our Officer on Board._ Upon this Col. Bullet was permitted by
      Col. H---y to go down to the River and enquire into this Matter. The Co[l.J dressed himself in
      Red, rode down to the Sh[ore]) at a Distance from every Person, bowed to the Ship and waved
      his Hat, but they immediately run out all their Guns primed them and discharged one at him.
      The Col. however paraded it for some ti[me] to shew he was not afraid and then came ba[ck]
      satisfied that he had been misinformed or that it was intended as an insult altogether. </P>

      included in that regulation, as we are informed From all parts that the Clamours of the people
      begin to be high on Accot of that Article, and we greatly Fear the consequences if some method
      cannot be fallen on to Supply their wants - we are sorry to say we hear nothing promising From
      Mr Tate, and are told <name>Ld Dunmore</name> has already collected a large quantity &amp; is embracing
      every Opportunity, by seising what comes in his way, of increasing his store, we doubt not
      with an intention to. test the Virtue of our people, when the want of that necessary Article,
      becomes more sensible among them.</P>
   <P>Tho' we se[e] the Utility of the measurs adopted by the Congress For the importation of these
      necessaries, we at the same time - cannot avoid contemplating the danger &amp; almost
      insuperable difficulties, which in Our Opinion will attend the carrying it into Execution
      here, in our defenceless State without a single Armed Vessell to give the exports &amp;
      imports even the Shadow [of] Protection - this circumstance, with the bad prospect we have of
      the Former experiment in the Bills of Exchange, induces Us not to take upon Ourselves the
      adoption &amp; Execution of this proposition, but to submit it to a Convention which is to
      meet the first day of December, And the determination shall be communicated to you if your
      continuing to sit in Congress shall prevent our having the pleasure of yr. Assistance. </P>
   <P>Our best Accounts make the Force of <name>Ld Dunmore</name> &amp; the Navy to be this. The Otter &amp;

   <P>We Sympathise with you in the disagreeable Feelings you must sustain On the disgraceful
      patience &amp; Suffering of some of our people, which tho' confined to a very few will be
      charged to the Colony. The only Appology For them is the exposed Situation of their Families
      &amp; property, the want of Arms &amp; Amunition &amp; their intermixture with Torys, who
      instead of Assisting were ready every moment to betray them. We could not protect them We had
      men enough, but , were left to ransack every corner of the Countrey For Arms, tents &amp;
      other necessarys. The few we collected were unavoidably retained here For the protection of
      our Magazine Treasury &amp; Records; both Regiments are now tolerably Armed &amp; Our Troops
      are marching to Norfolk - let Us have Credit For driving them off at Hampton, &amp; For having

   <P>Portsmouth 12 Nov. 1775</P>
   <P>Dear Sir</P>
   <P>As I never keep copies of familiar Letters, its probable I may sometimes repeat what I may
      have given you in the preceding one, if that shod be the case I flatter myself your candour
      will forgive such an error, without any further apology I shall proceed to give some account
      of matters here; we have an exceeding Good Battery on Peirce:S Island mounting three 32
      pounders one 24 one 18 six 6s four 4s well provided with all necessary implements, on Seavy we
      have only one 24 six 4s, &amp; 6s the work on the Batteries are well executed, and were nearly
      finished when we were alarmed with the news from Falmouth of the destruction of that place
      some account of which you have had in the Papers, but least you should not have had the
      particulars of that cursed piece of barbarity, I'll give it you here by way of digression, as
      I had it from a Gentn who left that Town two days after that act of Cruelty. The pirates
      arrived in the harbor on Monday afternoon [October 16] but lay some distance below the Town.
      on Tuesday P.M. they got under sail and came before and as near as they can lay to the Town
      and sent.a Boat ashore with that pretty piece of Composition published in the Essex Gazette
      with the signature of <name>H Mowet</name>, on the receipt of which a committee of three gentlemen, who had
      been particularly kind to the Barbarian who commanded went on board in hope that their
      influence might prevail so far as to have the distruction of the Town delayed 'till they might
      have time to move their women &amp; children &amp; effects out, but their efforts were to
      little purpose, indeed the savage made them this generous offer, that if they would deliver up
      all their arms &amp; ammunition, &amp; swear allegience (I don't know to who but suppose it
      must be to the Devil as it is evident they must act under the influence of his Infernal
      Majesty) send on board four of the principal gentlemen as hostages, he would delay the
      destruction of the Town 'till he could hear from the Admiral, on the whole, the best terms
      they could obtain; was if they would deliver up part of their arms he wod suspend the
      execution of his infernal orders 'till 9 o'clock, next morning, they being intirely
      defenceless; not one cannon fit for use &amp; very short of powder for their small arms
      comply'd so far as to send him eight Muskets. At the time set next morning the agents of Hell
      began their work and kept a constant fire 'till evening. .A:bout ¾ths of the Buildings were
      destroyed and about half the effects, the news reached us about 8 o'clock on Thursday morning,
      &amp; that Mowatts orders were to come here next. This alarmed many people so that they set
      about moving out of Town, expresses were immediately dispatch'd to all parts of the country to
      call in assistance the summons was readily obeyed; people flocked in from all quarters, &amp;
      in a few days were in such a situation as to wish the approach of the enemy, that we might
      have it in our power to revenge the abuse of our Brethren of Falmouth. We also sent a
      messenger to General Washington telling him our situation and begging a little powder as we
      had only 17 lbs but none could be obtained. I am certain it gave the General great pain that
      it was not in his power to assist us, however, we were tolerable easy with what we had as the
      crookedness of the river and strength of the tide is a great security to us, the flouer ship
      is sunk in crooked Lane to stop up that passage. A boom placed obliquely across the River from
      Henderson Point to Peirce's Island, four vessels moored just above the boom to set fire to if
      there should be occasion twenty pr fire rafts ready to burn off whenever called for; this is
      our scituation at present, there has been 1000 men in pay ever since the ;larm (about a
      fortnight:[)] The [Provincial] congress voted yesterday eight companies of 100 men each,
      exclusive of 200 montrosses before ordered to be enlisted, for two months the Expenses
      attending these preparations are immense for this poor colony, but I hope the benevolence of
      the United Colonies will consider us on some future day, at present it seems to me to be the
      determination of every one to risque his all in support of his liberties &amp; priviliges, the
      unheard of cruelties of the enemy have so effectually united us that I believe there are not
      four persons now in portsmouth who do not justify the measures persuing in opposition to the
      Tyranny of Great Britain - the men of war arc frequently cruzing of[f] in the Bay, but dare
      not or at least do not venture in, about a week ago a frigate 2 anchored between Bass Rock
      &amp; Odiornes point; when she first appeard it was thought she was coming into the Harbor but
      she disapointed us by going off early next morning. About 250 men are stationed on New Castle;
      the inhabitants have all left that place There is a Battery of six guns on Kittery point. 12
      pounders is the heaviest mettle there. I am very sorry they are not better provided; however
      on the whole our harbor is in such a state that if the Enemy shod think proper to make us a
      visit we should give them a warm reception 3 </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Cambridge, November [12] 2 1775.</P>
   <P>A number of Transports are just arriv'd at Boston, and from our Acct. from thence, 2500 Troops
      are Landed; the truth, as yet, we know not. Our time of late hath been much taken up in
      building Barracks, and putting our Men undr. Cover; which, in ten or twelve days more I hope
      will be compleated. Whether Genl. How[e] after receiving such a Reinforcement will remain
      quiet in his Quarters, is a matter to be determined; on thursday last [November 9] about four
      or five hundred of them taking advantage of a very high Tide, landed at a place called
      Litchmores Point (opposite to Boston and then an Island) distant about ¾ of a Mile from our
      Lines on prospect Hill, but upon the appearance of two Regiments advanced towards them, over a
      Cause[wa]y (waste deep in Water) they retreated having first killed and carrd. of[f] 10 head
      of Cattle, but with the loss of two of their Men (so near were our Regiments to them). We had
      three men wounded; two I fear mortally. </P>
   <P>The destruction of Falmouth, and the Inclination which has been shewn of bestowing the same
      favour on other Towns (which, by being prepared for their reception, have averted the blow) is
      evident proof of the diabolical designs of Administration to prosecute, with unrelenting Fury,
      the most cruel, and Savage War that ever a Civilized Nation engaged in as it also is, of the
      necessity of adopting every means which can be devis'd for the preservation of property; this
      led me to hint to your part of the Country through Lund Washington, the expediency of stopping
      the Navigation of the Potomack without loss of time; conceiving that at an Expence, not
      amounting to one tenth of the damage which the Estates on the River may sustain in the course
      of next Summer, such obstruction's may be laid as to prevent any Armed Vessel from passing. I
      do not pretend to point out the place where or precise manner how, this is to be effected. In
      Delaware they have attempted it by sinking of Chevaux, de Frieze, and Row Gallies. In Potomack
      I think it might be done by Chevaux de Frieze (or sinking of vessels) and Batteries on one, or
      both sides of the River as Circumstances might require. I have often heard, that some where
      below Quantico the Channel was so narrow as to [] so, and the Land adjoining is proper, what
      [] the attempt? Highland is the [] these kinds of Batteries; because [] from thence [] at the
      same time [] it [] receive no kind of Injury; where Batteries upon a Level are [] Silenced.
      Guns dismounted by the ships. If such a Situation [] Colo. Fairfax could be found [] it would
      be impassible; because [] 3 Vessel is Raked from Stern to Stern from the time she gets within
      reach) of your Guns, till she is directly under them; and from Stem to Stern till she is out
      of reach of them, after passing; and this without bringing more than one or two guns to bear
      on you, without heaving too which would protract her passage. I mention this matter, because I
      am very willing to have my property taxed to its proportionate amount to effect a Plan of
      defence to it. </P>

      to intercept her) to look particularly into <name>Cape Anne</name> Harbour, and, if she should be there and
      could not be cut out, to set her on Fire, but if not arrived to cruize for and conduct her to
      Boston. It happened that the Canceaux had not Water sufficient to go to Sea with, and the
      Weather was too bad at the time to take any aboard, so that she was unavoidably obliged to
      tarry until it became more moderate. Indeed the last Week had been so tempestuous that it was

   <P><name>My Lord</name> I have the honor to inform Your Lordship that I received on the 28th day of last month
      from the Post House in Wilmington a Packet from Your Lordship's Office, bearing the most
      palpable evidence of violation and no Post mark whatever, but (Hampton 25/6) written on the
      upper corner of the cover. This being the name of the first town within the Capes of Virginia,
      I am led to conclude, that the Packet I have received is part of what Your Lordship taught me
      to expect by Your last dispatches by a store Ship that was about to sail for that Province,
      which being there put on shore has fallen into the hands of the Committees who have
      transferred it from one to the other after purloining it of what they have thought meet, until
      it has been finally deposited in the Post Office at Wilmington, as it carries no marks of the
      intermediate Post Offices at Norfolk Suffolk Edenton and New Bern. I shall use my utmost
      endeavours to discover by what means and through what channel this Packet came to the Post
      Office at Wilmington, and if I am able to ascertain that point, of which I own I have no great
      hopes, it may be possible to trace back its whole progress to the first violation. </P>
   <P>I flattered myself that my representations to Your Lordship of the violences which had been
      done by Congresses and Committees throughout this Continent would have arrived timely to
      prevent Your Lordship trusting Your Dispatches to any other conveyances than the Packets to
      South Carolina the ordinary Channels of Your Lordship's correspondance, (whose letters for me
      are lodged by my directtion, on board The King's Ship there) or by his Majesty's Ships bound
      thither, or to this Port.</P>
   <P>The Scorpion Sloop of War arrived here yesterday from Boston, 2 and brought me letters of old
      date from General Gage discouraging my expectations of any aids from him. This Ship is come to
      relieve the Cruizer Sloop which is certainly in too bad condition to proceed to Boston at this
      Season of the year, and is necessary as well as The Scorpion, and may be usefully employed
      here to guard against the introduction of wilitary Stores that I learn are very deficient
      among the Rebels here who are in constant expectation of Supplies by Vessels which have been
      sent for them. these circumstances I have represented to Captain Thornborough at <name>Charles Town</name>,
      who is the Commanding Officer of The King's Ships in the Southern Provinces at present, and I
      hope he will order things accordingly. I have also advised that a Transport, which General
      Gage has sent here under Convoy of The Scorpion, to remove the Artillery from <name>Fort Johnston</name>,
      should remain here 'til the Spring, after receiving those Stores on board, as her return to
      Boston at this time of the year, will be very hazardous, and uncertain. </P>

   <P>Capt. Tufts, of the colony scooner Defence, who had been ordered to cover and protect the
      sinking of a number of hulks, prepared for that purpose, on the bar of Hog-Island creek, so as
      to obstruct the passage of ships of war through the said creek - reported.</P>
   <P>That having yesterday, about two o'clock in the afternoon, proceeded with four hulks, in order
      to sink them upon the bar of that creek, being about gunshot from the King's ships Tamer of
      16, and Cherokee of 6 guns - as he approached the place of his destination, the Tamer fired
      six shots at him, which he, just coming to an anchor, returned with two; that the Tamer
      continuing the cannonade, he contented himself with returning only one shot more, and then
      proceeded to sink the hulks. That he accordingly sunk three of them, but the fourth not coming
      up early enough in the tide, he continued the night on his station, in order to sink her also,
      at a proper time of tide. That about a quarter after four this morning, the Tamer and
      Cherokee, having warped nearer to his vessel in the night, discharged their broadsides at him,
      and continued the cannonade until about seven o'clock; when having, notwithstanding so heavy a
      fire, carried her to her proper station, and having scuttled her in various places, left her
      sinking, and then having no further duty to perform, he retreated. That however, as the hulk,
      being loaded with sand, was a considerable time in sinking; and as he was considerably
      retreated, the Tamer sent an armed boat, which fired the hulk, towing her into shallower
      water, where she shortly after sunk. That, in his retreat, he ineffectually fired a shot at
      this armed boat, but finding his shot would not be of any service, he refrained from such an
      expenditure of ammunition. That notwithstanding so long and severe a cannonade from the Tamer
      and Cherokee, he received no other damage, but one shot under his counter, one in his
      broadside, and a third which cut his fore starbard shroud. That he had not one man wounded.
      That in general, the shot pas.sed between his rigging and struck the main land. And that
      amidst this imminent danger, the officers and men on board, although in general, new in the
      service, displayed the greatest chearfulness, tranquility and coolness. 2 </P>
   <P>Ordered, That the thanks of the Congress be returned to Capt. Tufts, for his spirited and
      prudent conduct upon this occasion: And also to Capt. <name>William Scott</name>, who acted as a volunteer
      in the command of the marines on board the schooner Defence; And that those gentlemen be
      requested to return the thanks of this Congres.s to all the officers and men who acted under
      their respective commands. </P>
   <P>Ordered, That Mr. [John] Edwards, Capt. [John] Joiner, Capt. [Thomas] Shubrick, Mr. [John]
      Neufville, and Mr. Verree, be a Committee to consider the expediency and expence of
      immediately fitting, arming, and manning the ship Prosper in the service of the colony, for
      the purpose of taking or sinking the men of war now in Rebellion Road. And that the said
      Committee do immediately sit, and report thereon without loss of time. </P>
   <P>Mr. Edwards, from the Committee to consider the expediency and expence of immediately fitting,
      arming, and manning the ship Prosper, in the service of the colony, delivered in their report. </P>
   <P>Which being read. Ordered, That the same be taken into consideration this afternoon.</P>
   <P>Adjourned to five o'clock this afternoon. </P>
   <P>Sunday Evening, November 12, 1775.</P>
   <P>The report of the Committee to consider the expediency and expence of fitting, arming, and
      manning the ship Prosper in the immediate service of this colony, for the purpose of taking or
      sinking the men of war now in RebellionRoad, being taken into consideration. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That the ship Prosper be immediately impressed and taken into the service of the
      colony, and fitted and armed as a frigate of war, with the utmost expedition. </P>
   <P>Ordered, That Mr. Edwards, Capt. Shubrick, Capt. Joiner, Mr. Neufville, and Mr. Verree, be,
      and they are hereby appointed commissioners, under whose direction Capt. [Edward] Blake and
      Capt. [Robert] Cochran are to proceed to fit, arm, and man the ship Prosper, with all possible
      expedition.</P>
   <P>Whereupon Mr. President was requested to write to Col. [William] Moultrie, as follows:</P>
   <P>Charles-Town, November 12, 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir, </P>
   <P>You are hereby ordered to post a detachment of fifty able men from the regiments under your

   <P>By Order of Congress. </P>
   <P>Gentlemen,</P>
   <P>South-Carolina, Charles-Town, November 12, 1775.</P>
   <P>The actual commencement of hostilities by the British arms in this colony against the
      inhabitants, is an event of the highest moment to the southern part of the United Colonies on
      this continent: therefore, lest so important an event should be misrepresented, I am directed
      to inform you of the particulars of it, and of a subsequent action.</P>
   <P>As it was found necessary to obstruct the channel of Hog-Island creek, being one approach to
      this town from Rebellion-Road, Capt. Tufts, commander of the colony scooner Defence, mounted
      with two nine-pounders, six six-pounders, and two four-pounders, having on board seventy
      seamen and marines, proceeded yesterday, about two in the afternoon, with four hulks, in order
      to sink them upon the bar of that creek, being about gunshot from the King's ships Tamer of
      sixteen, and the Cherokee of six guns. - As Captain Tufts approached the place of his
      destination, the Tamer fired six shot at him, which Capt. Tufts, just coming to an anchor,
      returned with two; and the Tamer continuing the cannonade, Capt. Tufts contented himself with
      returning only one shot more, and then proceeded to sink the hulks. He accordingly sank three
      large scooner hulks, but the fourth not coming up early enough on the tide, he continued the
      night on his station in order to sink her also, at a proper time of tide. About a quarter
      after four in the morning, the Tamer and Cherokee, having warped nearer to Capt. Tufts in the
      night, discharged their broadsides at him, and continued the cannonade until about seven
      o'clock, when Capt. Tufts, having notwithstanding so heavy a fire, carried the hulk to her
      proper station, and having scuttled her in various places, left her sinking, and then, having
      no further duty to perform, he retreated. However, as the hulk being loaded with sand, was a
      considerable time in sinking, and as Capt. Tufts was considerably retreated, the Tamer sent an
      armed boat which fired the hulk, towing her into shallower water, where she shortly after
      sank. Capt. Tufts in his retreat, ineffectually fired a shot at this armed boat, but finding
      his firing would not be of any service, he very prudently refrained from such an expenditure
      of ammuntion. Notwithstanding so long and severe a cannonade from the Tamer and Cherokee, on
      board of which last Lord <name>William Campbell</name> has for some time past fixed his residence, Capt.
      Tufts received no other damage, but one shot under his counter, one in his broadside, and a
      third which cut his fore starboard shroud, not a man was wounded. In general the shot passed
      between his rigging and struck the main land; and amidst this imminent danger, the officers
      and men on board, although in general new in the service, displayed the greatest chearfulness,
      tranquility and coolness during this heavy fire. <name>Fort Johnson</name> discharged some twenty-six
      pounders at the Tamer and Cherokee, but the cannon requiring an elevation of ten degrees to
      reach them, rather than continue to discharge such random shot, the firing from that post was
      discontinued. </P>
   <P>The inhabitants of this metropolis were in general spectators of the latter part of the
      cannonade. The drums beat to arms, and the militia in a body assembled under their officers,
      with such alertness, and so properly armed, as gave the highest pleasure and confidence to the
      public. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>My dear General,</P>
   <P>The Badness of the Weather &amp; worse Roads have put it out of my Power to get here before
      Yesterday - A favorable Wind the Night before enabled Mr Carleton to get away with his little
      Garrison on Board ten or eleven little Vessels reserved for that Purpose &amp; to carry away
      the Powder &amp; other important Stores. - I don't despair of getting hold of the Powder yet -
      No Diligence shall be wanting for that Purpose - By Intercepted Letters I find Colo: Arnold is
      certainly arrived in the Neighberhood of Quebec, that the King's Friends are exceedingly
      alarmed &amp; expect to be beseiged. - Which with the Blessing of God they shall be if the
      severe Season holds off &amp; I can prevail on the Troops to accompany me - The Lizard Man of
      War is arrived there she has brought £20,000 Sterling &amp; 100 Marines They have had some
      other little Reinforcements of Recruits for McClean's Regiment &amp; Artificers to the Amount
      in all of including Marines &amp; Sailors [of] 450 Men - one of the Brigs is arrived with
      Cloathing &amp; Arms for the faithful Canadians as Mr Carleton with Propriety terms them.- </P>
   <P>This Morning we have taken Possession of the Town I send You their Articles of Capitulation
      with my Answer &amp; hope It may meet with Approbation. -</P>
   <P>I can't help feeling great Uneasiness till I know the Determination of the Troops with respect
      to engaging for six Months longer - I was obliged at <name>St Johns</name> to promise all such their
      Dismission as chose it, to coax them to Montreal Indeed Wooster's Regiment shewed the greatest
      Uneasiness. I make no Doubt of retaining as Many as will hold the Ground already gotten - but
      it is of the utmost Importance to finish this Business at once that the Ministry may have no
      Hopes left of carrying on their infernal Plan[s] in this important Quarter - At any Rate it
      will be highly expedient to throw in a large Body of Troops as soon as the Ice will bear in
      order to make a Vigorous Attack on Quebec before the arrival of Succours in the Spring should
      It not fall into our Hands this Winter - but should this Instance of good Fortune crown our
      Labours, some Advantageous Post must be chosen below Quebec, where a large Corps of Troops
      strongly posted, a Boom over a Narrow Channel &amp; floating Batteries may baffle all Attempts
      from Europe, I am told a difficult pass, termed the Traverse will Answer this Purpose, if your
      Health will not permit You to engage in this Affair. - I think [Charles] Lee ought by all
      Means to have the Command here. I send some Choice Letters of that Worthy &amp; steady Freind
      to the Colonies, <name>Brook Watson</name>, whose Zeal is only to be equalled by his Sincerity - You will
      think them of Importance enough I believe to be communicated to General Washington &amp; the
      Congress, Your Freind Mr <name>William Smith</name> has been pretty well humbugged by this Gentleman. </P>
   <P>I am exceedingly sorry Congress have not favored me with a Committee - It would have had a
      great Effect with the Troops, who are exceedingly turbulent &amp; indeed Mutinous. - My
      Vexation &amp; Distress can only be alleviated by reflecting on the great Public Advantages
      which must arise from my unparallel'd good Fortune. -</P>
   <P>I shall clothe the Troops compleatly who engage again. I find with Pleasure that my Politicks
      have squared with the Views of Congress, &amp; shall loose no Time in calling a Convention,
      when my intended Expedition is finished. -</P>
   <P>Will not Your Health permit You to reside at Montreal this Winter? I must go home If I walk by
      the Side of the Lake, this Winter, I am weary of Power &amp; totally want that Patience &amp;
      Temper, so requisite for such a Command. -</P>
   <P>I will take it as a Favor, If You will send <name>Henry Livingston</name> with Your Dispatches for
      Congress. -</P>
   <P>I wish some Method could be fallen upon of engaging Gentlemen to serve, a Point of Honour
      &amp; more Knowledge of the World to be found in that Class of Men, would greatly reform
      Discipline &amp; render the Troops much more tractable. </P>
   <P>The Officers of the 1st Regiment of Yorkers &amp; Artillery Company were very near a Mutiny
      the Other Day, Because I would not stop the Clothing of the Garrison of <name>St Johns</name>. - I would
      not have sullied my own Reputation Nor disgraced the Continental Arms by such a Breach of
      Capitulation, for the Universe - there was no driving It into their Noddles, that the Clothing
      was really the Property of the Soldier, that he had paid for It &amp; that Every Regiment (in
      this Country especially) saved a Years Clothing to have decent Clothes to wear on particular </P>

      ministerial navy in this harbour, weighed anchor and went up the Bay, near Warwick Neck, where
      they met two Provincial sloops, who engaged them warmly for a short time, when night coming
      on, and the wind blowirig excessively hard at S.E. they parted; and next morning the brig,
      schooner, &amp;c. came down again.</P>
   <P>'Tis said two of the tenders were hull'd, and received some considerable damage in their sails
      and rigging; the Provincial slo[ops, we h]ear, received scarcely any in jury at all. </P>

   <P>Last Friday arrived here the Sloop Defiance, Captain <name>Lamuel Hatch</name>, from Antigua, who informs,
      that on his passage near the Capes of Virginia, on the 2d Instant at five in the afternoon, he
      spoke a sloop from that place outward bound, the Master of which informed him, that the men of
      war were then battering down the town of Norfolk, and advised him not to go in, which he
      otherwise would have done. 1 </P>

   <P>The affair of the ships taken at Portsmouth 2 has not been considered by Congress, by reason
      of urgent Business; But I expect soon, that that &amp; several other captures will be taken
      under consideration &amp; some General Rules adopted; when any thing is Determined on it, will
      inform you by the first opportunity ... </P>
   <P>Tho' probably the Continent will be well supplied with Powder in the Spring, yet it is best by
      all means to put it out of the power of our enemies to Defeat us of that necessary article, by
      supplying ourselves, and if we have a double or Treble Quantity it will be no Damage, and in
      future save our Cash from being sent abroad after it. </P>

   <P>The Committee of Safety meet tomorrow Morning at 9 oClock And attend the Committee of Assembly
      at 10 - On Wednesday Morning 9 oClock the Board meet and go into the Consider[ation] of the
      appointment of a Commodore, at which time the Mem[bers] are requested to meet punctually</P>
   <P>Wm Gavett Secry </P>
   <P>1. Franklin Papers, XLIII, 190, APS. Govett was secretary of the Pennsylvania Committee of
      Safety. </P>
   <P>2. The date is approximated. The Committee of Safety, in a Memorial to the Pennsylvania
      Assembly, September 29, 1775, recommended appointment of a commodore. The memorial was
      received and tabled and the Assembly adjourned the next day. It reconvened on October 14, and
      on October 20 approved the Committee's recommendation and asked it to suggest or nominate a
      suitable person for the post. Captain <name>Thomas Read</name>'s name was submitted to the Assembly on
      October 23. On October 30 the thirteen galley captains presented a memorial urging the
      Assembly to select, on the basis of seniority, one of their group, rather than an officer
      previously unconnected with the service. Franklin, who had been on a mission to Cambridge,
      returned on November 1, but did not attend a Committee of Safety meeting until Wednesday,
      November 15. The Assembly adjourned November 25. As neither the Assembly journal nor, the
      Committee minutes refer further to the controversy over the commodore, and as Read was not
      confirmed, the above letter probably was written Monday, November 13. Franklin also attended
      the Committee on Friday, November 17. </P>

   <P>After Lord Dunmore, supported by the North British Tories, had long committed every outrage at
      Norfolk unopposed, our people not having Arms or amunition until lately; his Banditti at
      length attempted Hampton, where they met with the chastisement you will see described in the
      part of Dixons paper inclosed.2 The Lieutenant Wright there mentioned has been since found
      dead on the Shore, a bullet having been placed in his body before he jumpt over board. We have
      not yet heard the consequence of their next intended attack, but it seems a very heavy
      Cannonade was heard there the next day. If the Devil inspired them to come on shore, I make no
      douq.t but we shall have a good account of them. I have a very particular reason for
      entreating that you will inform me by return of Post, what number, and what strength of Armed
      Vessels could possibly be procured from the ports where you are to be in Delaware Bay, if
      Congress should desire it, by the middle or last of December at furthest. Two or 3 Vessels of
      tolerable force, issuing from hence, may effect a stroke or two of great consequence to us at
      that Season. </P>

   <P>The tenders which came up to Jamestown the week before last, being hindered by our riflemen
      from burning the ferryboats at that place, went down the river, and in the night destroyed the
      boats at Mulberry island, and at Hardy's, on the opposite shore; where there was no notice of
      their arrival, and consequently no opposition. And last Thursday [November 9], a large
      schooner, and two sloops, carrying small cannon and swivels, sailed up to Burrell's ferry,
      under convoy of the Kingfisher, capt. Montague; and coming to, in line of battle, abreast of
      the ferry-house, warehouse, and boats, hailed a small boat which lay at anchor about 300 yards
      from the shore, ordering her alongside of the man of war; but ten riflemen, who happened to be
      stationed near this place, marching up to the bank, as near as they could get to the boat,
      ordered the skipper to stay where he was. Upon this the man of war fired at the boat, to
      enforce her orders, which so frightened the skipper that he would willingly have obeyed; but
      the riflemen also firing, their superiour metal prevailed. The man of war then sent off a
      barge to bring her off, which, as soon as within reach of our rifles, was so warmly saluted
      that she thought proper to row back with precipitation, having lost, as was thought, from
      their falling down, three men; upon which a smart cannonade ensued, but luckily did no other
      execution than sending a six pound ball through both sides of the warehouse, very near to some
      of our men, and several struck and buried in the bank under them. Soon after, the man of war
      made a second attempt to take the boat; but the rifle guard having received a reinforcement of
      ten men, it proved as ineffectual as the first, for the barge, on receiving a smart fire, was
      immediately called back to the ship. Thus, by the bravery of a mere handful of men, the
      ferry-boats have been preserved from destruction; and the boat in dispute still remains where
      it was, and where our people ordered it should stay. These 20 brave fellows declare they want
      no assistance if even all the men on board the ship and tenders should attempt to land,
      provided they come on shore fairly before them, and not land at several places, too far above
      and below them at once. </P>

   <P>Watertown, November 14th 1775</P>
   <P> . . . great Numbers of the Whalemen are gone on Voyages which we permitted after haveing
      taken Bonds for the Landing their Oil &amp; Bone in some Port here other than Boston, &amp;
      Nantucket. Some of them are in the Army, &amp; Sea Coast Service many of them, &amp; the
      greater part of our Fishermen &amp; Seamen at Home &amp; in no Service Earnestly wishing to be
      Employed in the Privateering Business. what Numbers might be Inlisted on that Service I cant
      readily Compute, but I have no difficulty in supposeing that at least three Battalions might
      be raised in this Colony. the taste for it runs high here. As to ships &amp; other vessels, I
      believe there are great Numbers very suitable to Arm Already on hand. Almost every Port of any
      Consequence could furnish more or less, either great or small. perhaps Ships might be
      difficult to find that could mount 20 Guns or Upwards, but Vessels to Carry from 6. to 16 Guns
      I think we abound in, &amp; I think they would soon furnish us with others. these Vessels are
      of all Burthens, drafts of water, &amp; dimensions &amp; are many of them Excellent Sailors,
      &amp; may be either purchased, or hired, on very reasonable Terms. I think the General gives
      only 5/4. p Ton p Month. I am not Acquainted at Haverhill Newberry &amp;c. but from what I
      have heard Vessels might be Built there, safe &amp; with great dispatch, and perhaps at
      Kennebeck and No River &amp;c &amp;c. we have no want of the best Shipwrights. as to the Time
      for Compleating them, much will depend on the winter but they may be ready as soon as wanted
      in the Spring if Immediately engaged in. As for your Next Question, the Names, &amp;c. of
      those fit to Command, I am not quite so ready to answer You know we have not practised
      Privateering so much here as they have in some of the other Colonies &amp; it is A Business I
      never was Concerned in, but I have no doubt that many fine Fellows can be found, who have been
      Masters of Vessels &amp; at some time in their Lives served on Board Men of War &amp;
      Privateers. I have one Capt Sam[p]son [<name>Simeon Sampson</name>] in my employ who has serv'd in both,
      &amp; perticularly with Capt [John] Mcpherson the last War. him I. would venture A Vessel
      with. there is [Daniel] Souter who you know. Time wont premit me to recollect many others, but
      from the Nature &amp; Circumstances of this Colony there must be many. I will Endveavour to
      recollect some for my Next. I am glad to see the Policy of Congress turned this way, &amp; to
      see you Engaged you must know I think you qualified for any thing you will undertake. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Philadelphia, Nov'r 14, 1775</P>
   <P>I had yesterday the pleasure of your letter of the 4th inst. by Captain [Thomas] Price, for
      which, as well as the former kind letter, I heartily thank you.</P>
   <P>The report you mention that Congress have resolved upon a free trade, is so far from being
      true that you must have seen by the public papers before now that they have resolved to stop
      all trade until next March. What will be done then time will discover. This winter I hope will
      be improved in preparing some kind of defence for trade. - I hope the Colonies will do this
      separately. - But these subjects are too important and intricate to be discussed in a narrow
      compass, and too delicate to be committed to a private letter.</P>
   <P>The report that Congress has resolved to have no more connections, &amp;c. untill they shall
      be indemnified, for the damage done by the tyranny of our enemies, will not be true perhaps so
      soon as some expect it. Verbal resolutions accomplish nothing. It is to no purpose to declare
      what we will or will not do in future times. Let reasoning Man infer what we shall do from
      what we actually do. </P>
   <P>The late conduct, in burning towns, so disgraceful to the English name and character, would
      justify anything, but similar barbarity. Let us preserve our temper, our wisdom, our humanity
      and civility, though our enemies are every day renouncing theirs. - But let us omit nothing
      necessary for the security of our cause. </P>
   <P>You are anxious for Arnold. So are we, and for Montgomery too, untill this day, when an
      express has brought us the refreshing news of the capitulation of <name>St. Johns</name> - for Arnold I am
      anxious still - God grant him success. - My compliments to Gen. [Artemas] Ward and his Family.

   <P>Dear Sir,</P>
   <P>Roebuck at Halifax 15th Novr 1775 </P>
   <P>It will, I am sure, give you pleasure to learn that I am not only arrived in America, but that
      I am also perfectly recovered from a dangerous &amp; obstinate fever, which began the day
      after we parted at Yarmouth, and did not leave me untill we reached the Western Islands,
      however the Air &amp; Refreshments of Fyal (which by the bye is a delightful spot for Climate,
      soil &amp; fine Views) together with a constitution naturally a good one, got the better of
      the disorder, and made the latter part of the voyage, which was tolerably short, not
      unpleasant to me.</P>
   <P>I arrived here the last day of October, in order to land Comodore &amp; Com missioner
      Arbuthnot who was my Passenger, and should have proceeded immedi ately for Boston, but we
      found this place in so defenceless a state; liable each Night to be surprized by the Rebels;
      that it was thought necessary the Roebuck should remain here, for a further security to the
      Kings Dock yard, untill the Admirals pleasure should be known. I need not point out to you,
      Sir, the great importance this Colony is of to Great Britain, as besides the immense supplys
      of Cattle Wood &amp; Hay it has sent to the Army at Boston, it is the only one acknowledging
      at present the Kings Government; therefore how necessary it is to secure it!</P>
   <P>By our last accounts from Boston, every thing remained as General Gage had left it, or at
      least nothing material had happened. From all I am able to learn here, I cannot help
      concluding that the whole conduct of the Summer Campaign has been nothing but a scene of
      repeated blunders, I speak chiefly of the Sea department. The affair of <name>Bunker Hill</name> was owing
      to the removal of the Somerset from <name>Charles Town</name>, as whilst she lay there, the Rebels could
      not take Post on Bunker hill; and the loss we sustained there was caused by a manifest mistake
      of sending the small Vessels up a River to the left when they ought to have gone-to the river
      on the right, which would have carried them within two hundred yards of <name>Charles Town</name> Neck. The
      Frigates were also wrong placed, calculated merely to cover the landing, and neglected
      proceeding to a spot where they might have enfiladed the Rebels behind that fatal farm which
      did us so much mischief.</P>
   <P>I write in a great hurry to save an opportunity that offers of sending this letter by a ship
      that has called in here merely to clear out of the Custom House, and is now under sa,il. I
      have therefore only time to desire you will present my respect ful regards to Mr Jenkinson, Dr
      Oylez [&amp;c.] </P>
   <P><name>A. S. Hamond</name> </P>
   <P>P.S. We are extreamly anxious to hear from Canada. The People here dont think it unlikely that
      should the Rebels fail there they will pay this place a visit on their return. This I think is
      but barely possible, but if they should we shall be prepared for them. </P>

   <P>From the Little acquintance I had with you in Trade when here a few Years Ago, I now Imbrace
      this Oppotunity to Address You In this Manner. As Capt Dovall [Douville] Informs Me You have a
      Vessel at <name>St Peters</name> 2 where you Dwell, I have to propose to You to take of you a Load of Good
      Merchtb Codfish Deliverd here any time between this and the first of March Next at 15/ L M, p
      Quentle [Quintal] Dollars at 6/-and Liver Oil will now fetch a Very grait Price - Common
      Pins(calld Calking pins)is worth 10/ a Pack Course Linnen &amp; Checks are worth 50 pt more
      than they Used to be - and Good soldier Guns compleetly fitted with Iron or Steel Ramrods
      &amp; Bayenets are worth 10 Dollars apiece, &amp; pistles swords &amp; Hangers in proportion -
      But Above all that Most Wanting is Cannon &amp; Pistle Powder Mr Dovall tells Me he thinks You
      Might be Able to pick up five Tons &amp; bring here before March if so I would Warrant that
      you get half a Dollar p lb for every lb If Deliverd here by the first of March, provided you
      would let Me be One half Consern'd in the Powder, or if you Choose it I would be half
      Consern'd in the Whole Cargo, which should be bought on the Best Terms at <name>St Peters</name> &amp;
      shiped onbord a Good Vessel yourself Master, That is to say One half on My Accot &amp; Resque
      my part to be all Insur'd at <name>St Peters</name> - There will be no grait Danger except the Seas, to
      Come, in the Winter As the English Men of War &amp; Tenders will Doubtless be All in Winter
      Quarters before that Time. </P>
   <P>And as they have two Priveteers out of Connecticutt &amp; two from this Colony the Small
      Tenders keep in Close to the Men of War I dont beleave it would be Worth, or that it would
      Cost 10 pCt to Insure it from <name>St Peters</name>, Nor near so much to go to Stoningtown, New London,
      New haven, or Sag harbore on Long Isld at all which places you are well Acquainted &amp; When
      Arrived at Sag Harbore it may be known whether safe to Come in here - You Must know Sr the
      Grand Advantage would be in bringin the Powder, as the Grand Continental Congres.5, have
      Resolved to Allow All Vessels that bring powder into [this] Colony to take &amp; carry away

   <P>An Express having arrived with an account of the surrender of fort <name>St. John</name>'s, the letters

   <P>The Committee to whom the petition from <name>Jasper Griffin</name>, and the petition from Murray, Sansom
      and company and others, were referred, brought in their report as follows: That your committee
      on the memorial of <name>Jasper Griffin</name>, are of opinion, that the examination of the facts, set
      forth in that memorial, ought to be referred to the committee of observation, for Guilford,
      and that the same being sufficiently proved, the schooner Betsey, mentioned in said memorial,
      ought to be permitted to proceed on her voyage, with the cargo purchased and provided for her
      before the 10th day of September last, the master and owner of the vessel previously making
      oath, that they will use their best and utmost endeavours, that the said Cargo shall be landed
      in some foreign port.</P>
   <P>On the memorial of Murray, Sansom and company, <name>Jacob Watson</name>, and <name>Frederick Rhinelander</name>, of the
      city of New York, your Committee having examined as far as they could, into the conduct of the
      parties concerned, find no ground to suspect that the owners of the cargo intended it should
      be landed or disposed of in any other manner than set forth in the said memorial, but your
      Committee think there are just grounds to suspect, that <name>William Barron</name>, the master of the ship
      Peggy, would not be very solicitous to prevent the cargo, which might be useful to the
      ministerial army, from falling into the possession of the men of war, he having been before
      taken in the same ship, in Rhode Island, with a cargo from Chesapeak Bay, for Europe, nor can
      your Committee approve the conduct of the Owner of the Ship who continued the captain
      afterwards.</P>
   <P>Your Committee are therefore of opinion, that another master ought to be appointed to the said
      ship, who shall be approved by the committee of Norwich, and that the time of her sailing, as
      well as her tract be appointed by that committee, and the master sworn to use his best
      endeavours to prevent the said ship falling into the possession of any men of war or cutter,
      and to pursue as far as he can, the orders of the said committee in navigating the said ship,
      on which terms your Committee are of opinion&quot;, the said ship ought to be permitted to

   <P>Last night, a boat full of men attempted to land near the place where two rifle sentinels were
      placed by Capt. [John] Green, on the Jamestown beach, about half a mile below the captain and
      his men. The sentinels immediately challenged them, but received no answer, upon which they
      fired at the boat, than about 50 yards distance, and one cif them ran off to capt. Green, to
      bring him to the place, finding that the boat returned their fire - and was pressing on them.
      The other sentinel loaded again and fired, the boat still rowing on till within 20 yards of
      the shore, when he discharged his rifle a third time, upon which he heard a terrible shrieking
      on board, and found that they tacked about and made off; so that, before capt. Green could
      come up, this brave fellow had repulsed a boat crowded with men. </P>

   <P>You are Immediately to examine into the state of the Artillery of this Anny and take an
      account of the Cannon, Mortars, Shels, Lead, &amp; Ammunition that are wanting. 2 When you
      have done that, you are to proceed in the most expeditious manner to New-York; There apply to
      the President of the Provincial Congress &amp; learn of him, whether <name>Col Reed</name> did any thing
      or. left any Orders respecting these Articles &amp; Get him to procure such of them as can
      .possibly can be had there. The President if he can, will have them immediately sent hither;
      If he cannot, you must put them in a proper Channel for being transported to this Camp with
      dispatch before you leave New-York. After you have procured as many of these Necessaries as
      you can there, you must go to Major <name>Genl Schuyler</name> and get the Remainder from Ticonderoga,
      Crown Point, or <name>St John</name>'s - If it should be necessary from Quebec, if in our hands; the want
      of them is so great that no trouble or expence must be spared to obtain them - I have wrote to
      General Schuyler, he will give every necessary Assistance that they may be had &amp; forwarded
      to this place with the utmost dispatch. I have given you a Warrant to the Paymaster General of
      the Continental Anny for a Thousand Dollars to defray the Expence Attending your Journey &amp;

      were to be sent to me, I desired Mr [Joseph] Reed on his way to Philadelphia, to enquire into
      this Matter; as I have not heard from him on the subject, and the Season advancing fast, I
      have thought it necessary to send Hen: Knox, Esqr who will deliver you this. After he forwards
      what he can get at your Place, he will proceed to <name>Genl Schuyler</name>, on this very important
      business. </P>

   <P>Sir:</P>
   <P>Nantucket, November 16, 1775.</P>
   <P>After my humble respects to you, I am very sorry of the misfortune you met with, as I was
      informed, by the master of your tender, that you had very much hurt one of your eyes, which I
      took this opportunity to let you know that I am still a good friend to Government, and to let
      you know, by writing, that I never have been actor in any things against Government, and have
      never taken up any carnal weapons against the King's troops, but have suffered so as to have
      my gun taken from me, because I have bore my testimony against the measures that the America
      have taken to get their liberties, as they say they do; and, as I will not take up arms
      against the King's troops, and to rightly bear the title of a Rebel against my King, I have
      been threatened of being shot by those that is greatly against Government, yet I never intend
      to take up aims (through Divine assistance, although I may lose my life,) against my King,
      knowing he has undoubted right to be a terror to evil-doers, and I hope he will be a praise to
      them that do right.</P>
   <P>Captain Ayscough, I shall take it a great favour, and should be humbly obliged to you, if you
      would inform the Governour and Admiral of me, as it is not a thing impossible for me (by land)
      to get a letter to Boston, or to come myself, to let them know my mind, without risking my
      life, and wife and children's lives, and to lose all my estate; and, as you took me and my
      schooner, about two or three months ago, as I was going into Nantucket, and did use me with
      great civility, arid I did then let you know my mind about the forces, and you did take my
      name down, and where I lived, which now makes me to take the boldness to trouble you with
      these few lines, desiring you would oblige me so much as to do all you can for me in these
      evil times, that if it should please the King's Majesty to show any mercy to any innocent
      persons, that I might share part with such, as a true King's subject, so that I might save my
      life and estate, if the King should conquer the America. And I would, also, inform you that I
      have got a brother, and a cousin, whose name is <name>Daniel Lovell</name> and <name>Christopher Lovell</name>, which,
      both of them, are good friends to Government, which did desire me, that if I had a chance, to
      inform some of the King's officers of them. </P>
   <P>And now, pray, sir, don't let any body that is of the America party to know that I ever sent a
      letter to you, or that I ever desired you to return my name to the Governour, by no means, if
      you have any regard to my life; and you will, in keeping it private, greatly oblige me

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Your proposals for settling a truce between the town of Newport and Capt. Wallace we have
      received and examined, and as. the word unexamined in your proposals seems to us will not be
      complied with by Capt. Wallace, request you will leave the same out, as we apprehend it
      contrary to his instructions and the acts of Parliament, and are fearful it will greatly
      impede the wished for truce. </P>

   <P>Gentlemen, I received yours this day, wherein you request the word unexamined may be left out

      interest to let it remain. I am, [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>Newport, Nov. 16, 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Your proposals for a truce with this town were laid before us yesterday, by a Committee
      appointed to wait on you for that purpose. We should be happy in complying with them, but our
      very unhapply situation we fear is such, that however anxious we are to comply with your
      proposals, we shall not have it in our power, unless Capt. Wallace will please to consent and
      agree, that whatever provisions, &amp;c. he may have occasion for, should be procured and
      furnished him by <name>Samuel Dyre</name>, Esq; who will wait on you to receive your orders for the same
      whenever you please. Our great fear is, that should your men be suffered by you to come in to
      our market, we should not be able to prevent them from being taken. If Capt. Wallace will
      agree to be furnished by Mr. Dyre, we hope the truce may be preserved; and you may be assured
      every thing shall be done by us, and the greatest part of the inhabitants remaining in town,
      that it shall not be violated on our parts. We also promise that every thing shall be done to
      prevent the troops from coming into town: Capt. Wallace to be furnished with fresh beef,
      &amp;c. for his ships use, lying under his command here; the ferry, market, fish and
      wood-boats to pass and repass unmolested.</P>

   <P>His Majesty's Ship Rose, Nov. 16, 1775. Gentlemen, I have received yours of the 16th inst. It
      is perfectly agreeable to me to take the provisions from any person you choose to appoint. The
      greatest care shall be taken to preserve the truce on our side, for which reason our men shall
      not be permitted to enter the town, unless the rebels enter, and oblige us for the King's
      service. I am, [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>The Council having received the within from Capt. Wallace, consent that he shall be supplied,
      for his ships' use in this harbour, with two thousand pounds weight of beef per week; and has
      now requested six hogsheads of rum, which we think i[t] necessary he should be supplied with,

   <P>CAPTAIN BERNARD ROMANS TO THE COMMISSIONERS FOR FORTIFICATIONS IN THE HIGHLANDS 1</P>
   <P>Gentlemen -</P>
   <P>Martler's Rock, 16th Nov. 1775. </P>
   <P>As I am a great hater of epistolary altercation, I was not willing to answer your long starter
      of difficulties, which seems to me a declared commencement of a paper war instead of an answer
      to my reasonable remonstrances of 2d instant; but as I am determined that you should not think
      yourselves unanswerable, I resolved this morning to honour your long answer with as short a
      reply as the nature of things will allow; at the same time assuring you that this is the last
      paper I shall blacken on this head, and that I will take care that my pen shall proclaim the
      voice of truth. </P>
   <P>Your introduction seems intended to be of the humorous kind. You play on my words and call a
      conspicuous light what I called a rank. I will do no more than think as I did then; and as in
      a private station I have more than once exerted myself for Americ&quot;a, you may rely on it
      that I will do no less, now I am honoured with the post and rank the [Provincial] Congress has
      conferred on me, the dignity of which commission I shall try to preserve with military
      vigilance and spirit.</P>
   <P>To your first, wherein you say, &quot;it was my duty to let the commissioners know the
      proportion of labourers wanted to the artificers.&quot; I knew my duty, I did it, and so I did
      to the Committee of Safety, which last, I dare say remember my complaint about it; and if the
      commissioners' memory fail them, some one of them may remember when one evening we were on
      that topic, I ventured to say, that since my plan was approved of, I thought myself the person
      who should direct all. The polite answer I got on that head I have not forgot, though it made
      me resolve an imposition of silence on myself till the state of affairs would naturally
      dispose matters to flow in their proper channels. How far you are judges of work I know not,
      as I am not acquainted with your extent of experience, but I often heard you complain about
      the freezing out of the masonry. I beg leave to inform you that on a single brick wall of 9
      inches, a frost may take out 3 inches on .each side, but it can not take out quite so much of.
      our wall; because, as the thickness increases, the effect of the frost decreases, and can not
      be more than 2 inches at most on the outside of our works, which must be pointed over again in
      the spring; and this new pointing I mentioned before ten stones were laid in the wall. All men
      who ever were necessitated to work late in thick work, will, from experience, vouch the truth
      of my assertion. </P>
   <P>To your second and third, relating to the block house, I did not exaggerate my number of
      carpenters. I still stand to my promise and can do it. I do not remember any expostulations,
      except shrugging up shoulders can be called so, for that always was the answer to my many
      times repeated plaints in regard of hewing and rehewing of the timber, and whenever that kind
      of expostulation happened, I used to recollect your original polite answer of &quot;We are not
      grown so old to allow you to direct the work.&quot; With regard to a road, you made your
      landing in a wrong place before I came here; and when I used to be angry at so many hands
      working on roads at unseasonable times and unnecessary. places, I always got my labour for my
      pains; and how shortly is it ago since I got the ill will of one of you for barely telling the
      labourers that there was no necessity to remove a certain stone laying near a road which was
      then making? My proposal of oxen was as soon as they became necessary, and I then said buying
      was preferable to hiring, unless people would bring forage along with them. You might have
      bought them, but instead of that, you countermanded some that were bought, as you did of
      getting of timber, even now before one-fifth of the. timber is got that is mentioned in my
      estimate. What you mean by an elegant outside appearance, I cannot conceive. My calculations
      of the necessary iron work is just, except indeed, the rings and staples outside of the ports,
      which I never thought of, nor would have had them there had you not ordered some one to put
      them there. About the &quot;inside lined with so much' nicety and expence,&quot; the extra
      cost of this, is no more than one day and a half easy work for a carpenter, (about 14s.) for
      it must be lined let who will live in it, and as it generally is the residence of an officer,
      as this is now for me, I thought passing the jack plane over one side of the lining was the
      least that could be done. What would you have said, had I lined the roof, divided the lower
      room with panel partitions, and put up a panel ceiling to remove-and put up at pleasure? for
      most block houses are so, and the meanest are partitioned. It seems your ideas of a temporary
      work is, that it ought to last six months - to build a new one again. </P>
   <P>As to trunnels, I ordered 2,000 of oak, when locust was not to be had. I do not know what
      ruined your credit, but the badness of that among the country people prevents your getting
      anything regularly. </P>
   <P>I planned, gentlemen, but remember you ordered even that, though you could not so well direct
      that case as you could when you spoiled my plan of the barracks. What you mean by a waste of
      timber, I am utterly at a loss for; my order of 18 feet long was right, and had I ordered them
      the just length, they might have come 3 inches too short, and then indeed it would have been
      waste; but had they been 3 inches too long, the sawing off of 3 inches would take as long time
      as sawing off 2, 3 and 10 feet, which I wanted elsewhere. </P>
   <P>The day I got your epistle, I looked around the works for waste timber; I saw none but chips,
      and I confess, I was struck with the thought, what a pity it was nature gave our carpenters so
      much trouble. The truth is, gentlemen, you have no business with my calculations of the kind,
      you are to judge afterwards; you have before now, seen what your no trifling extraordinary
      expense of timber goes to. The mention you make of the pieces being unwieldy is curious; I can
      not see what odds it made to the men, to have them sawed at the landing or at the mill; they
      would have been 11 feet in either case; and excepting some trifling iron work, that was not
      finished, I was right in my judgment about the 10th of November, for that day I lived in it,
      and I received your letter there. By what necessity do you introduce the order for mounting 12
      guns? have I ever opposed it, and are we not on the point of having 20? </P>
   <P>To your fourth, I must tell you, that Mr. White, the master carpenter, being an acquaintance
      of Mr. [Samuel] Bayard, was indulged with the liberty to make evening visits to you, and this
      gave rise to a distinction, insomuch that Mr. Addams has been told to let Mr. White go on with
      such and such particular work, he, Addams, need not trouble himself about it; this produced
      two master carpenters, and Addams justly complained of the matter, because White, at first,
      treated him as his superior, but at length became his equal. Yet, still, I think as I did
      then, country carpenters are preferable, and what makes the use of them impolitic, is a
      conception beyond my ideas. </P>
   <P>Fifthly. My calculation of the oxen's work is evident; I can show you how a teamster himself
      and one man may load his cart; but as every country clown knows how, it is below me, even
      while I am the paltry being that is not allowed to direct his own plan, for as the helping of
      the oxen is the finest skulking berth our labourers can find, I do not know whether I would be
      safe in destroying it, while I have no command. But, gentlemen, your wheels were too low, and
      when a new pair was bespoke, I pleaded long to have them timber wheels; but no, they must be
      common cart wheels; and now they are come, they are common cart wheels indeed. As to the six
      men employed to steady the stone, I only tried the oxen (twice) on the wall, and found the
      fear of the animals made it unsafe; I desisted, therefore, and men only have done it. You will
      please to remember, that that machine was no cart, and with it I have brought stones of two
      ton weight to the wall, very different from a piece of timber of 10 or even 8 feet long; it
      was my invention, but any body might have thought of that, as well as of Columbus's egg. If my
      calculation of forage is below the mark, please to know that it is far above what the people
      of the country allow to their cattle. </P>
   <P>Sixthly. Labourers may be had under the regulations I mentioned; I can get 500 if need be. </P>
   <P>In your seventh, you catch at my word &quot;superficial,&quot; as drowning people do at
      straws. I will tell you something, perhaps to you extraordinary; what I call a
      &quot;superficial&quot; view, was such as most other surveyors would call a perfect survey. I
      am, from long experience, enabled to take more exact surveys of places with a piece of paper
      and pencil, than perhaps 99 beside me can, with all the circumstantial apparatus generally
      used. It is true, I forgot the iron for the barracks, but have you mended that mistake by
      using nearly as much on one block house as I intended to use for the whole work? Glass is a
      trifle; 318 panes cost about £6 12s.6d. Transport of stores surely includes freight for board
      and shingles: and work to be made on the spot by the blacksmith, surely shewed, that I was
      aware more iron would be required than I could think of: In short, I am more and more
      convinced, that my estimate is right; the price of the article of lime only, excepted, which I
      calculated at Philadelphia or New-England price, little dreaming that it cost above twice as
      much in New-York. </P>
   <P>To your eighth, I insist upon it, you must have miners here. And as to the labourers mauling
      the stone, need I tell you, gentlemen, that I have of ten been out of all humour, to see them
      work in stone that would not split, as I knew how to get them to the wall of any size; but
      here, again, my authority failed me. </P>
   <P>To the beginning of your ninth, I have perhaps gone a little below the dignity of my office.
      This proceeded chiefly, because I found that many of our gentry took the advantage of drawing
      their provisions when they intended to decamp the very next morning. But what I mentioned
      about tools in this article, is what you ought to have answered: here I spoke in my proper
      sphere; but this you waived, to proceed to a matter, which, had I not been convinced of the
      integrity of your transcriber, I could have never thought would have proceeded from you. It
      looks so much like the little vengeance of disappointed scolds. I deny your ever having
      requested me to send my negro away. Mr. [William] Bedlow once told me this: &quot;Mr. Romans,
      you had better get a place for your negro;&quot; but I could not construe this into a request,
      much less an order from men who have no manner of authority over me. The negro is more rogue
      than fool; but he is so harmless, that while people let him alone, he will be quiet. He is a
      new negro, and by his actions he sometimes diverts your people; but I defy you to point out a
      single instance of dissatisfaction on that score. Once, indeed, there was a complaint against
      him, for which I gave him a severe chastisement, and you know that I had reason to be sorry,
      when (almost immediately after) his innocence appeared. But, gentlemen, he never cost you nor
      the country any thing, as there was never an ounce of provision served out for him; he has
      lived on scraps from others; and he must be a sorry dog indeed, that does not deserve the
      crumbs from his master's table; he might at least, serve me to fetch wood and water. I have
      provided a place for him, but not in obedience to you. </P>
   <P>It is hard indeed that I, who in my private station, have for many years past never been
      without a servant, or even two or three, should be raised to a public one, to be debarred that
      privilege. I know no place where so cruel a prohibition would take place; while I was in the
      service of the King my pay was greater, and I had sundry rations allowed, although my servants
      were in pay and drew provisions besides. Since I arrived last to the northward, now near three
      years ago, I have always maintained and fed a number of people, seldom less than six, at high
      wages, and now not to be allowed any attendance at all, is surely never meant. People whose
      duty it was to ask me whether I was in want of any thing, have been reprimended for coming to
      the block house; but your mention of Mr. Addams astonishes me beyond every thing; was it
      necessary, my copy book would show you his handwriting, to make it appear that he has for
      years back transacted my business; he is a gentleman in whose fortunes I am interested, and I
      will assist him with all my means. You say &quot;He is an officer that you can by no means
      aUow of.&quot; Sure I want him not_ to be your officer, if he is mine it is enough; and to it
      you add, &quot;If you retain him, pay and procure provisions for him;&quot; how mean the
      inuendo ! I have often done it. It is true it was said Mr. Vandome was to assist me; he came
      up to be the clerk of the cheque, and as such you retained him; but since I saw him employed
      as commissary of stores, and as clerk to the commissioners as well as clerk of the cheque, I
      thought it cruel to ask assistance from him, my business well followed is three men's work.
      Perhaps you think me your officer too. Softly, gentlemen; that will never do. The [Provincial]
      Congress appointed me to a rank I esteem more honourable than any I ever held, yet for 14
      years back I have been sometimes employed as a commodore in the King's service; sometimes at
      the head of large bodies of men in the woods; and at the worst of times I have been master of
      a merchantman fitted in a warlike manner. I will in future draw the provisions the Congress
      will allow me, and that will maintain us both. </P>
   <P>To your tenth I have nothing to reply. But your lastly is too important to let pass unnoticed
      - the necessary alterations must be made before the work goes on well; and as for seasons,
      such business as this waits none, if we keep not the work going, we will in spring again be
      new beginners. I interrupt none of your powers; I meddle with none; but you have hindered me
      from having as much again work done, and till I am sole director of my plan, things cannot go
      well. None can be more happy in the union you mention; but if I must be cap in hand,
      gentlemen, to be an overseer under you, it will not do, depend upon it, I have too much blood
      in me for so mean an action, and you must seek such submissive engineers elsewhere. If I
      execute my plan which is approved of, I have no business to consult you any farther than that
      you must find me people and pay them; if in that case, I do not comply with my enterprise,
      then is your [duty] to disapprove and complain, but not before. I am, gentlemen, [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Virga. <name>Caroline Novr</name>. 16th. 1775.</P>
   <P>Last week the King Fisher and four tenders full of men came up to Burwells Ferry and made
      several attempts to land during three days stay, but never came nearer than to receive a
      discharge of the Rifles, when they retired with great pricipitation, and 'tis Supposed the
      loss of some men. They had in [the?] time a droll contest for a small Cyder boat with one man,
      who lay between them about 200 yds. from shore. He attempted to come on Shore, when a Cannon
      Ball from the Navy passed just over his head and deter'd him. He then set.sail for them, when
      a Rifle brought him too; he gave a Signal to the Man of War, who sent a Boat full of men for
      him, but When near, a Volly of Rifle bullets hurried them back without their prize. This was
      several times repeated 'til the Fleet moved up to <name>James Town</name>, when the Riflemen seised the
      Boat, but the Man and Cyder were gone .... Nor do I think Ld. Dunmore will be so sanguine
      about his Piratical War, as he was, since he finds that small Arms in the hands of a few men
      will keep numbers from landing. His slave scheme is also at an end, since it is now Public
      that he has sent off a sloop load to the West Indies, which has made others use every endeavor
      to escape from him, and will stop his further increase of that Crew. </P>

   <P>We hear from Smithfield that this day doctor Foushee, from Norfolk, is just arrived there, and
      gives intelligence that the king of the blacks, alias pirate, alias Dunmore, and his banditti,
      consisting of regular soldiers, sailors, negroes, and Scotchmen, in number about 350, marched
      to Great Bridge, in Norfolk county, in order to take up the bridge, and reconnoitre the
      ground, expecting our troops to meet them by that time, and give them battle; but being well
      informed that they were not near, and hearing of about 150 of the Princess Anne militia being
      on their march to meet our men, instead of waiting for our regulars, marched in quest of those
      few friends in that part of the world, who with bravery, and warmed with the justice of their
      cause, fought with courage, which we hope will shine in every American's heart, till
      overpowered with numbers, were obliged to retreat, with the loss of colonel <name>T. R. Walker</name>, Mr.
      <name>John Reade</name>, and two other gentlemen, who were killed on the spot, and colonel [Joseph]
      Hutchings, and a few others, taken prisoners. There were not men enough left in Norfolk to
      guard the shipping, not even one left on shore to stand as centinel. From this we may conceive
      the strength of our unnatural enemies in that quarter.</P>
   <P>We this. moment learn that colonel Walker and Mr. Read were not killed in the late skirmish at
      Norfolk; but there was but one man that fell. </P>

   <P>This day serjeant Kelly was sent from the camp at Cobham with the account of the affair at
      Princess Anne. He crossed a little above where the man of war and tenders lay, who fired
      several shot at him, but he luckily got safe ashore with his dispatches. This Kelly is a very
      brave soldier, and was the first man that boarded the tender taken at Hampton. - The man of
      war likewise fired a few shot at col. Travis's houses at Jamestmyn, one of which went through
      the kitchen chimney. </P>

   <P>SIR</P>
   <P><name>Edenton Novr</name> 16th 1775 </P>
   <P>I have this day had the honour of receiving your Excellency's Letter signi fying that you had
      been pleased to suspend me from acting as Deputy to Mr Turner in the Naval Office, with the
      reasons for such removal, and it gives me pleasure that I do not find neglect of the duties of
      my Office in the Catalogue of my Crimes. </P>
   <P>At the same time that I hold myself obliged to your Excellency for the Polite manner in which
      you are pleased to express yourself of my private Character, you will pardon me for saying
      that I think I have reason to complain of the invidious point of view in which you place my
      publick Transactions, when you consider the late meeting of the Delegates or Deputies of the
      Inhabitants of this Province at Hillsborough, a Body of my own Creation, Your Excellency
      cannot be ignorant that I was a mere Instrument in this Business under the direction of the
      people, a people among whom I have long resided, who have on all occasions placed the greatest
      Confidence in me, to whose favourable Opinion I owe everything I possess and to whom I am
      bound by Gratitude (that most powerfull &amp; inviolable tie on every honest mind) to render
      every Service they can demand of me, in defence of what they esteem their just rights, at the
      risque of my Life &amp; Property </P>
   <P>You will further, Sir, be pleased to understand, that I never considered myself in the
      honorable light in which you place me, one of the King's Servants; being entirely unknown to
      those who have the disposal of the King's favours, I never enjoyed nor had I a right to
      expect, any Office under his Majesty; the Office which I have for some years past executed
      under the Deputation of Mr Turner was an honest purchase for which I have punctually paid an
      Annual Sum, which I shall continue to pay till the expiration of the Term for which I should
      have held it agreeably to our Contract. </P>
   <P>Permit me, Sir, to add that had all the King's Servants in this Province been as well informed
      of the disposition of the Inhabitants as they might have been and taken the same pains to
      promote &amp; preserve peace, good order &amp; Obedience to the Laws among them, that I
      flatter myself I have done, the Source of your Excellency's unceasing Lamentations had not at
      this day existed or had it existed it would have been in so small a degree that e'er this it
      would have been nearly exhausted; but, Sir, a Recapitulation of Errors which it is now too
      late to correct would be painfull to me and might appear impertinent to your Excellency, I
      shall therefore decline the ungratefull Task, and beg leave, with all due respect to subscribe
      myself Sir [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>Mr. <name>Christopher Champlin</name>, contractor for victualling the ships here, this day informed the

      calivance, which he bought in June last for the use of the ships here, under the command of
      Capt. Wallace; and he informs us, that he some time since informed Capt. Wallace, that he had
      such provisions bought for his service, but as affairs were, he could not deliver them to him;
      and he therefore now informs the Council thereof, that they may act therein as they may judge
      fit: Whereupon we recommend it that said provisions may be delivered to Capt. Wallace, for his
      ships use, as he says he has already charged them, and that his accounts are closed. We
      therefore, if it be agreeable, request that you will give orders for the delivery thereof.</P>

      per week, and the last week he asked for two thousand pounds weight; but when he came to
      receive it took no more than sixteen hundred and twenty-four pounds, he being governed by the

      take no more than for the number of men he now has here, and request you will allow him to

   <P>You are desired to repair immediately to the City of New York and there purchase a ship
      suitable for carrying 20 nine pounders upon one deck, if such a ship can there be found. Also
      a sloop suitable to carry ten guns, which we would choose should be Bermudian built, if such a
      one can be had. If you succeed in purchasing both, or either of these Vessels, you will use
      all possible expedition to procure them to be armed and equipped for the Sea. </P>
   <P>For this purpose you will apply to, and employ such persons as can carry this business into
      the most speedy execution. Should there be danger in fitting these Vessells at New York from
      the King's ships, you may then send the vessels eastward thro the Sound to New London or
      Norwich in order to be armed and fitted, and there, use every means in your power to procure
      this to be done with the utmost expedition. </P>
   <P>In the Colony of Connecticut, you are to procure powder for both these vessels, and such other
      Military Stores as can there be had. You will procure the Cannon and other Stores at New York
      or any other place where it can be done in the best and most expeditious manner. You will also
      procure Officers and Men suitable for these Vessels. </P>
   <P>As soon as these Vessels can possibly be fitted for the Sea, you will order them immediately
      into Delaware Bay. You will by every opportunity give us the most exact intelligence of all
      your proceedings by conveyances the most safe and secure that can be obtained. You are
      empowered to draw on Governor Hopkins for such sums of money as may be necessary for the above
      business.2 </P>

      of several Men of War, or if only a few, but of considerable Force as large Frigates, and you
      are of Opinion you could as soon, or sooner, reach Fort Island than an Express by Land, you
      must in that Case, besides calling at New Castle, run up in all haste to Fort Island, and on
      coming in Sight of the Island hoist certain Signals, which the commanding Officer of the Armed
      Boats there is to be made first acquainted with. </P>
   <P>If on the contrary, the Ships should be few or but of small Force, you are not to quit your
      Station otherwise than in running up to New Castle as above directed, untill they heave in
      Sight. You are to apprise all Vessels of their Danger, unless it should oblige you to run out
      of your way in coming up to lose time in reaching it. </P>
   <P>For these Services, you are to be allowed for your self, Boat and Men, Twenty five Shillings P
      Day. </P>
   <P>It is impossible to instruct you how to act under particular Circumstances and Situations not
      forseen by us, but we depend in all these Cases upon your Zeal for the publick Service, and on
      your Fidelity to the [Trust] reposed in you, which you ought to consider as extremely
      important. We are your humble Servants, </P>

   <P>As the Committee of Safety had adjourned before your Letter arrived here &amp; of Consequence
      no Answer could be had from them, I have taken the Liberty of writing what I conceive to be at
      least the Substance of what they would have written. </P>
   <P>There was as far as I can discover no Foundation for the Report you mention; but unhappily,
      last Night an Express arrived in Town bringing an Account, that on Monday last [November 13]
      Lord Dunmore having heard that a large Body of our Forces were marching to Norfolk under Col.
      Woodford, marched at the Head of 350 Men consisting of Soldiers Sailors Negroes &amp;
      Scotchmen, to the great Bridge to destroy it &amp; prevent the Passage of our Men - that he
      effected this, &amp; then went in prosuit of 150 Militia of Princess Ann who had imprudently
      marched induced by a false Report to join Col. Woodford, who was at that Time with a Part of
      his Regiment in Wmsburg That this Party came up with our Militia, who defended themselves with
      Bravery, but being overpower'd by Numbers were totally defeated several killed &amp; others
      taken Prisoners, amongst whom was Col. <name>Joseph Hutchings</name> -</P>
   <P>This Affair I hope will serve to rouse up our Country Men, &amp; will serve to lead our
      Enemies into such another Scrape as they ran into at Hampton - The Committee had resolved a
      Month ago to send dowp. the 2d Regimt &amp; the Culpeper Batalion of Minute Men to Norfolk -
      but for want of Arms Tents &amp;c &amp;c they were unable to march, the whole of them til the
      Day before Yesterday - A Detachment passed Jas River about 10 days since under Major Spotswood
      - &amp; were ordered to halt at Cobham til joined by the Col. &amp; Remainder of the Forces
      This Junction was delayed several Days for want of Necessaries, &amp; several more by high
      Winds &amp; the Interposition of the King Fisher &amp; several Tenders - which obliged our Men
      to cross the River higher up than was at first)ntended - This Delay for Want of proper Arms
      &amp;c has been very mortifying to us, &amp; has proved fatal to our Friends in the
      Neighbourhood of Norfolk - Purdie's Paper contains a particular &amp; true Account of what has
      been attempted by the Man of War &amp; Tenders &amp; what has passed between them &amp; our
      Men here - The naval &amp; Land Forces of Ld D-are as described in Letter from the Committee
      by the last Post The Committee of Safety would gladly have written you an Account of the State
      of Affairs here by every Post - had they not been hindered by a Multiplicity of Business -</P>
   <P>As I intend to reside here with my Family I will transmit you any Intelligence worth your
      Notice &amp; shall be proud to receive your Commands with Respect to procuring such as you may
      desire to receive - My Health will not permit me to write but a few Lines - I have therefore

   <Title>Purdie's <name>Virginia Gazette</name>, FRIDAY,NOVEMBER 17, 1775 </Title>
   <P>Williamsburg, November 17.</P>
   <P>Col. [Patrick] Henry received an express yesterday morning with the following intelligence,
      viz. that Lord Dunmore, having received advice that about 200 of the Princess Anne militia
      were on the march to join the troops destined for the protection of the lower parts of the
      country, marched from Norfolk last Tuesday [November 14], about 10 o'clock P.M. to intercept
      them; who, not having the least intelligence of his lordship's approach, were obliged to
      engage under every disadvantage, both as to the enemy's superiority in point of numbers, and
      the situation of the ground, being hemmed in by a fence. Our people fought a considerable
      time, and it is thought did great execution; but were at last overpowered, and forced to
      retreat, with the loss of mr. <name>John Ackiss</name> in the minute service, killed on the spot, and col.
      <name>Joseph Hutchings</name>, and one <name>mr. Williams</name>, wounded, who were taken prisoners, with seven others.
      The publick, no doubt, will be exceedingly incensed on finding that lord Dunmore has taken
      into his service the very scum of the country to assist him in his diabolical schemes against
      the good people of this government, all well attached to his majesty, but mortal enemies to
      his infamous ministry and their subordinate tools; but it is to be hoped his sphere of
      mischief will soon be circumscribed within narrow bounds, as col. Woodford, with about 800 as
      brave troops as the world can produce, are now on their march to Norfolk, and, should his
      lordship incline to give them battle, we have not the smallest doubt will give a very
      satisfactory account of him. </P>

   <P>Pensacola 17th Novr 1775</P>
   <P>On our return to this place I was honoured with your Letter of the 9th of July last, wherein
      you acquaint me of your having received the Plan of our Summer's work before last. - By the
      Sloop's coming here so soon we were able to set out early in the Summer, and return here in
      good Season before the cold stormy weather set in. I hope this will always be the case, as we
      can do our Business more effectually, and with greater Satisfaction. </P>
   <P>We began where we left off last year, and have carried on the Survey as far as <name>Cayo Largo</name>, to
      what I believe may properly be called Cape Florida in the Latitude of about 25 degrees North.
      We met with no good Harbours this year, for large Vessels, but a great many dangers to which
      they may be exposed. I shall endeavour to send a fair Copy by the Diligence or the next safe
      opportunity that offers. </P>
   <P>We met with two of His Majesty's Vessels last Summer along the Kays, vizt the Savage Sloop of
      War and the Saint <name>John Schooner</name>, from Providence for Pensacola: both of them went all the way
      between the Reef and the Kays; and as we happened to be at <name>Cayo Huesso</name> when the Savage was
      passing by Mr. Payne piloted her into the Harbour, where we then lay, at the desire of Captain
      [Hugh] Bromadge, who did not expect to find a Harbour there. It were. greatly to be wished
      that it was more generally known on account of its vicinity to the Ravanna, as Frigates and
      even fifty Gun Ships might easily go in. and anchor there in great safety. </P>

   <P>Copy of a Letter from Commissioner Arbuthnot 2 dated Halifax Careening Yard 18h November 1775 </P>
   <P>I pray you will be pleased to acquaint their Lordships that on my arrival at this place the
      1st Instant I found Commodore <name>Le Cras</name> in the Somerset under Orders to proceed to England when
      I came here, who I have detained as well as the Roebuck, which will I hope merit their
      Lordships approbation, I presume Captain Spry an Engineer at this place may have had orders
      from the General to set about securing this Yard because nothing had been done of consequence
      but within a fortnight. It is an unpleasant situation to defend because it is commanded by
      Hills, every way towards the Land which rises with a tolerable quick asscent but very regular
      for 600 Yards in the front of the Yard. </P>
   <P>Captain Spry is raising a platform round the Wall within for Men to fire over besides two
      redoubts one at each end in front to scower the Curtain. We shall likewise lose no time in
      strengthening the N:E &amp; S:W: sides of the Yard the latter having nothing but a few
      trifling pallisades lately put up to keep the Seamen from getting out of the Yard which at low
      water for a considerable way is but 6 Inches deep towards the Harbour, the other is overlooked
      by a steep Hill within forty Yards those we shall raise and put a platform also besides at
      each of those Extremeties are the Somerset and Roebuck moored with springs on their Cables, to
      prevent any impression on those places from succeeding, and likewise for scowering the
      aforesaid Hill upon the whole as soon as the Yard is completed, if those Gentry do not bring
      Cannon which I do not think they can we shall be able to give them a warm reception. </P>

   <P>Last Evening Mr [Benjamin] Grant arrived here with Your Letter of the Second Inst containing

   <P>We are very Sensible that Your Men without some Assistance must Suffer by the Cold in so
      severe a Climate and are anxious to do every thing in our Power for their Relief - From every
      Circumstance of their being ordered to join Genl Schuylers Army we supposed they were to be
      considered as Continental Troops, &amp; therefore no Provision has been made for them by the
      Congress of this Colony You say Paper Money will not pass there - no other can be procured
      here on any Terms: there is a Small sum of Silver &amp; Gold in our Treasury reserved for the
      Purpose of procuring Ammunition beyond Sea - out of which we have put into the Hands of Israel
      Morey Esqr £300 L M to be transmitted to you as he shall judge most safe &amp; convenient, for
      the Benefit of the Troops put under your Command by the Congi-ess of this Colony - which we

      endeavour to prevent their expending it unnecessarily, more especially as it is ali of the
      Kind that they can possibly be supplyd with from hence - We have wrote to <name>Genl Schuyler</name> and

   <P>The enclosed Papers I Received a few days ago. I suppose they came from Mr Hitchborn. 2 He
      appears very certain the Preston might be taken, but from her Situation, and being unrigged,
      it will be very Difficult, if not Impossible to secure her, for as soon as daylight appears,
      she might be Beat to Pieces by the Batteries of the Town, to which she would be a fair mark;
      or she might be retaken by being Boarded from the other Ships and Transports, which can
      furnish (together with the Town) a large Body of Men for that purpose. If she could be taken,
      but not carried off, would it not be an Essential object to Secure her Powder and Small Arms?
      for which purpose a Sufficient number of Whale Boats might Remove them to Chelsea in a short
      time and afterward[s] the Ship be Burnt: first Removeing the men to Noddles Island. -</P>
   <P>If Mr H----'s plan be a good one, might it not be applyed with a better chance of Success to
      the taking of the Boyne? which, According to H----lies near the west End of Spectacle Island
      rigged. If she could be taken, she might be, from her Situation, not only secured, but made
      good use of for taking the Castle, which perhaps in its present dismembered state might be
      attended with no great Difficulty. Here would be probably found a good collection of Arms and
      Amunition, the great Desideratum. - I am with much Esteem your Excys [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>[Boston November 18, 1775] 2</P>
   <P>The Commander of the Hinchinbrook, who arrived [November 17] a few days afterwards, reported
      however that since the first day of sailing from Boston, when he chased a Pirate into Salem,
      he had not seen an Enemy. Nevertheless the Admiral being anxious for the Safety of this
      Vessel, 3 and intent upon using every means to prevent her falling into the hands of the
      Enemy, ordered the Hinchinbrook out again, and the Nautilus; and they sailed accordingly
      within a day of each other. He determined also that the Lively should follow as soon as
      possible, and, as the Fowey and Tartar were hourly expected, he designed to make the latter,
      being clean, relieve the Mercury that was in great Want of careening. These Ships were,
      agreeably to the Admirals constant Orders to the Cruizers in Boston Bay, to protect and convoy
      Vessels arriving with Supplies from England, to visit occasionally <name>Marblehead Harbour</name>, and as
      the Winds and Weather would allow to range close in Shore and endeavour to cut off their
      Cruizers.* </P>

      came out from England with three Companies of Artillery, which, had they been distributed,
      would probably have preserved the whole and every one from being taken. </P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>I do Myself the Honor to congratulate Congress on the Reduction of Montreal &amp; inclose You
      Copy of the Terms the Inhabitants wished to have &amp; General Montgomery's Answer, together
      with Copies of sundry Letters from Mr <name>Brook Watson</name>, &quot;Whose Zeal (as General Montgomery en
      badiner expresses himself) is only to be equalled by his Sincerity.&quot; 2 </P>
   <P>General Carlton took the Advantage of a favorable Wind to go down the <name>St Lawrence</name> the Evening
      before General Montgomery arrived, he took with him his Garrison on Board of ten or eleven
      small Craft reserved for that Purpose &amp; to carry away the Powder &amp; Other Important
      Stores, General Montgomery is nevertheless in Hopes of possessing himself of the Powder &amp;
      I am sure no Diligence will be wanting on his Part to effect It. </P>
   <P>&quot;By Intercepted Letter I find, (says our General) &quot;that Colo: Arnold is certainly
      arrived in the Neighborhood of Quebec: That those who are Inimical to our Cause are
      exceedingly alarmed &amp; expect to be besieged.&quot; Which (he assured me) they will be, if
      the severe Season holds off &amp; he can prevail on the Troops to accompany him. - he adds </P>
   <P>&quot;The Lizard Man of War is arrived at Quebec with £20,000 Sterling and 100 Marines. they
      have had some other little Reinforcements of Recruits f[rom] Colo: McLean's Regiment (called
      the Emigrants) who together with the Artificers &amp; sailors may Amount in all to four
      hundred &amp; fifty Men.&quot; </P>
   <P>&quot;One of the Briggs which sailed some Time since from England is arrived with Cloathing
      &amp; Arms&quot; </P>
   <P>&quot;I cant help feeling great Uneasiness till I know the Determination of the Troops with
      respect to engag[ing] for six Months longer, I was obliged to promise all such their
      Dismission as chose It. I make no Doubt of retaining the Ground already gotten - but it is of
      the Utmost Importance to finish this Business at once that the Ministry may have no Hopes left
      of Carrying on their Plan in this important Quarter, At any Rate It will be highly expedient
      to throw in a large Body of Troops as soon as the Ice will bear, in Order to make a Vigorous
      Attack on Quebec before the Arrival of Succours in the Spring, should it not fall in our Hands
      this Winter; but should this Instance of Good Fortune crown our Labours, some Advantageous
      Post must be chosen, below Quebec, where a large Cor[ps] of Troops strongly posted, a Boom
      over a Narrow Channel &amp; Floating Batteries may baffle all Attempts from Europe. I am told
      a Difficult Pass termed the Traverse will answer this Purpose.-&quot; </P>
   <P>I have a Variety of Regulations in Contemplation but Time does not permit me to Communicate

   <P>In obedience to the order of the Provincial Congress, we the subscribers have valued the ship
      Prosper of Bristol, lately taken into the service of the colony; and it is our opinion, that
      two thousand pounds sterling, or the value thereof in current money, ought to be allowed to
      the owner or owners of the said ship. And we recommend that such sum of two thousand pounds
      sterling, or the value thereof, as aforesaid, be tendered to Capt. ---- Smith, late master of
      the said ship, on behalf of his owners: And that the register of the said ship, and a proper
      assignment, be at the same time demanded from the said Capt. Smith.</P>

   <P>Dear General,</P>
   <P><name>Montreal Novemr</name> 19th 1775</P>
   <P>I wrote to you the other day in a great hurry by express, sending a Letter for General
      Washington from Colo: Arnold - I have this morning had another Express from Colo: Arnold
      acquanting me he has crossed the River to the Quebec side, that he had been near surprizing
      the Town - that it was closely invested, that they were in the greatest confusion within, the
      Inhabitants having refused to take arms, a Scarcity of provisions &amp; Wood must bring the
      Garrison to Terms, were a blockade alone to be the measure adopted&quot; - Mr Carlton is in
      Statue Quo, about fifteen Miles on this side Sorel where I hope they will not let him pass.
      suppose Mr Carlton is on board the Fleet which left this upon my arrival, as I have never had
      any account of his making his escape. I have not yet been able to adjust the new form'd Corps
      or get our warm Clothing ready to go down touching which I am exceedingly impatient, Arnold
      having no artillery &amp; being in want of warm Cloathing. - I have appointed a Mr Mason (One
      of our friends in this Town) Post Master till the pleasure of Congress be known.</P>
   <P>I find Mr Price so active, &amp; intelligent, so warm a friend to the measures adopted by
      Congress, that I wish to have him mentioned in the Strongest terms to Congress - I have set a
      Regiment on foot of Canadians <name>James Livingston</name> Colonel - to be engaged for 12 Months, should
      this unhappy controvery last so long. </P>
   <P>I have made the Inhabitants acquainted with the views of Congress, relative to this Province,
      declaring I shoud call a convention upon my return from Quebec, I have had some conversation
      with <name>Pere Flacquet</name> a Jesuit at the head of the Society here, &amp; Esteemed a very Sensible
      fellow, he complaind of some little indignities shewn their order, particularly in making part
      of their house the common prison by his Majesty's Governors, I promised redress &amp; hinted
      at the same time, the great probability of that Society enjoying their estate (notwithstanding
      Sir Jeffery [Amherst's] pretensions) should this province accede to the General Union - I hope
      this hint may be of Service, the Priests hitherto having done us the Mischief in their power
      in many parishes, they will not yet give the people Absolution - However I have shewn all the
      respect in my power to Religion &amp; have winked at this behaviour in the priests for fear of
      giving malice a handle. </P>
   <P>I wish I could have apprized you in time of your obligations to Capt McKay he generously
      offerd Mr Carlton if he would give him Two hundred Men, to go &amp; burn the New Church at
      Saratoga last Summer, - he is so inveterate a fellow that I think if the other prisoners
      should be indulged in returning to their familys this winter, he ought not to be permitted to
      enter this province, when a Convention is Assembled, I propose requesting the return of the
      other Gentlemen on their parole. The inhabitants are our friends on both sides of the River to
      Quebec, our expresses go without interruption backwards &amp; forwards, a young Man who is got
      out of Quebec informs me that the Lieut: Governor, the Chief Justice &amp; Several others have
      put their baggage on board Ship, &amp; that no ship is permitted to Sail, - this looks as if
      they despaired of making a defence. <name>Colo McClean</name> has threatned a Sortie. Arnold is apprized of
      it, &amp; his troops wish for it -</P>
   <P>I hear there is a considerable quantity of powder at Niagara, perhaps this may be thought an
      object worthy of attention, they have been very apprehensive of an attack from the virginians
      in that quarter, all this Summer. </P>
   <P>I fear Carlton has thrown a great quantity of powder into the River, - I have desird a Severe
      message to be delivered to him on that Subject - Farewell my Dear Sir, &amp; believe me with
      all regard &amp; respect [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>Camp Cambridge, November 19, 1775.</P>
   <P>The Resolve to raise two Battalions of Marines, will (if practicable in the Army) entirely
      derange what has been done. It is therein mentioned, one Colonel for the two Battalions, of
      course a Colonel must be dismissed: One of the many difficulties which attended the New
      Arrangement, was in reconciling the different Interests and Judging of the merits of the
      different Colonels, in the dismission of this one, the same difficulties will occur. The
      Officers and Men must be acquainted with the maritime Affairs, to comply with which, they must
      be picked out of the whole Army, one from this Corps, one from another, so as to break through
      the whole System, which has cost us so much Time, anxiety and pains to bring into ~ny
      tolerable form. Notwithstanding any Difficulties which will arise, you may be assured Sir,
      that I will use every endeavour to comply with their Resolve.</P>
   <P>I beg leave to submit it to the consideration of Congress, If those two Battalions can be
      formed out of this Army, Whether this is a Time to weaken our Lines, by employing any of the
      forces appointed to defend them, on any other Service? </P>
   <P>As there is every Appearance that this Contest will not be soon decided and of course that
      there must be an augmentation of the Continental Army, would it not be eligible to raise two
      Battalions of Marines in New York and Philadelphia, where there must be now numbers of Sailors
      unemployed? This however is matter of Opinion, which I mention with all due deference to the
      Superior Judgment of the Congress. . . . </P>
   <P>There is no late Account from Captains Broughton and Sellman, the other Cruizers have been
      chiefly confined to Harbour by the Badness of the weather; 2 </P>

   <P>Captain Parker informs me that when <name>Lieutt Mowat</name> received his Order last Sunday night
      [November 12] the Canceaux had not sufficient Water in to go to Sea with, and that he was
      unavoidably obliged to remain until the Weather was more moderate to take it on board. I hope
      the Ordnance Brig 2 and all others bound here will get in safe, but it was impossible for any
      Ship to keep her Station in the Bay last Week all things considered. The Hinchinbrook came up
      last Friday Night; Lieutt [Alexander] Ellis assures me that since the first day that he sailed
      from Boston, when he chaced a Pyrate into Salem, he did not see an Enemy. I have ordered him
      out again with the Nautilus. The Lively shall follow as soon as possible; I hourly expect the
      Fowey and Tartar; the former being a clean Ship shall relieve the Mercury, which is in great
      want of being repaired and cleaned. </P>
   <P>I do assure your Excellency I am equally anxious for the Safety of these Vessels we expect to
      arrive, and every precaution shall be used to prevent their falling into the Hands of the
      Rebels. I am &amp;c</P>

   <P>Please to acquaint my Lords Commissrs of the Admty that a Council of War was held at the Lieut
      Governors at Quebec the 11th Inst the result of which I send home as also of another held the
      16th Inst by the determination of which, it was found Absolutely necessary by the Members to
      detain the Kings Ships as it was impossible to defend the Garrison without the reinforcement
      from them, I am therefore prepa_ring to lay them up in the best manner the time will admit of
      as it was determined to defend the place to the last &amp; it appearing it will with
      difficulty hold out til the middle of May, I think it my Duty to represent to their Lordships
      the absolute necessity of sending out a sufficient Force &amp; Provisions as early as possible
      And as Pilots may possibly be wanted have sent home some as likewise the private Signal in
      case the place should be surrendered into the Hands of the Enemy Their Lordships may depend on
      it no means in my power shall be neglected to destroy the Kings Ships if the place should be
      destioyed The Kings Forces are few the Canadians in general in the Interest of the Rebels,
      many of the Merchants indifferent so as they secure their property. The Garrison is extensive
      and in a Wretched State and confusion, Many things wanting par ticularly Match which was said
      to be in the <name>Elizabeth Storeship</name> but unloading her to find it, proved to be Twine &amp; Paper,
      &amp; the whole stock which is supplied by the Men of War; not exceeding 500 Wt as by the
      Council of War an Embargo was laid on all Shipping to prevent the Seamen from going out of the
      Province, as much depends on them in our present situation &amp; have given them directions to
      lay up their Ships as soon as possible as we are in want of their assistance And as they have
      shown great allacrity &amp; zeal for His Majestys Service &amp; now lay under many unavoidable
      losses both to themselves &amp; Owners beg leave to recom mend them to their Lordships for
      redress, And have inclosed their Petition. </P>
   <P>And as I have ordered Capt [Thomas] McKenzie on Duty on Shore with a Party of Seamen under his
      command I judged it for the good of His Majestys Service to order Lieut Tooks [Fooks] to
      command the Hunter in his absence We are in daily expectation of <name>Genl Carleton</name> with about 150
      Men with him from Montreal tho the Rebels have given it out they have taken the General &amp;
      his Men Prisoners -</P>
   <P>As it is not in my power to give their Lordships so full &amp; particular an Account of our
      situation as I could wish &amp; of many things which their Lordships might wish to be informed
      of have dispatched <name>Lt Pringle</name> of His Majs Ship Lizard to whom I beg to refer them who can give
      a very clear &amp; particular Account of the whole I have sent the Polly on this Service as
      none of the Kings Vessels could be spared &amp; have given her the preference on account of
      her Cargo being Flax Seed the property of the two unfortunate Clerks who would be hangd if
      they fell into the Rebel Hands - The Things of use for the Garrison I have taken out of the
      Elizabeth &amp; Jacob Storeships &amp; for fear their valuable Cargoes should fall into the
      Hands of the Enemy have ordered them either to Hallifax, Boston or England as the Weather will
      admit </P>
   <P>I beg leave to inform their Lordships that everything in my power &amp; Ships under my command
      will be used for the protection of the Garrison &amp; Province &amp; hope the steps I have

   <P>Sir </P>
   <P>Consistent with my duty I have the honor to inform you of the result of the Council of War on
      the 11th instant it was resolved to lay an Embargo, on all Shipping to prevent the Inhabitants
      from leaving the Province &amp; to detain the Seamen as they would be of particular Service in
      Our critical situation, to off[e]r a reward of 3 pounds for Seamen entering on board the Kings
      Ships &amp; to [put] all things in the best state possible to protect the Garrison, the
      necessity of detaining the Kings Ships til a Council of War was held which was appointed to be
      on the 16th inst when it was resolved to defend the Garrison to the last. The Inhabitants
      declared it would be i111possible to save the place if the Kings Ships went away as there was
      very few Regulars in the Garrison it was therefore - resolved to lay the Ships under my
      command up and land the _Men to do duty on Shore, I therefore gave the necessary Orders for so
      doing with as great expedition as the time would admit upon a calculation of the Provisions
      laid before the Council We have not more than will hold out with difficulty to. the middle. of
      May therefore it will be absolutely necessary We should be relieved - as soon as possible i~
      the Spring, I have inclosed a private Signal in case this place should be in the hands of the
      Enemy which I think cannot be the case if We are not betrayed, but if it should be so I shall
      do all that lies in my power to destroy the Kings Ships to prevent their falling into the
      Rebels hands. I have with the Governors approbation dispatched the two Storeships to Boston as
      the Stores on board them are of no use in the Garrison but of the greatest consequence to the
      ,Enemy, And as the situation of Affairs will not permit me to be particular beg leave to refer
      you to <name>Lieut Parry</name> of the <name>Elizabeth Storeship</name> who can inform you of every thing you </P>
   <P>might wish to know. by a Deserter from the Rebels we learn they are in want of Ammunition
      &amp; Clothing &amp; that they had retreated into the Woods on hearing a Salley was intended
      from the Garrison. I have the pleasure to acquaint you that his Excellency <name>Genl Carleton</name>

   <Title>LIEUTENANT <name>JOHN STARKE</name>'S SKETCH OF THE WAR IN CANADA 1</Title>
   <P>[Quebec, November 20]</P>
   <P>In the beginning of November 1775, His Majesty's Ship the Lizard with a Store Ship under her
      convoy arrived at Quebec, when that Province was invaded by the Rebels, with two different
      bodies of troops - One of which, under the command of General Montgomery, after taking
      possession of Ticonderoga, and making himself Master of all the Vessels and armed craft on the
      Lake Champlain, entered the Province by that rout - The other under the orders of General
      Arnold, made their appearance before Quebec, having taken their rout by Chaudie[re.] Every
      place of strength was now in their possession, that city excepted, which had no troops in it,
      and the Governor Sir <name>Guy Carleton</name> was absent, who had hastened to endeavour to save Montreal,
      upon receiving information of the progress which <name>Genl Montgomery</name> had made -</P>
   <P>It is not easy to form an adequate idea of the deplorable situation of the Town of Quebec at
      this time. The Governor was absent; the Lieut: Governor a feeble old man was diffident and
      uncertain what measures to pursue; there were no troops to make any defence; all the Artillery
      mounted on the Ramparts consisted of seven pieces of cannon; and the Inhabitants were in a
      state of despondency expecting that the Army under General Arnold, which having crossed the
      River <name>St Lawrence</name>, occupied the heights of Abraham close to the city, wou'd advance and enter
      the gates without resistance, for such was the consternation, that the gates were not shut,
      when the enemy was within a mile of them - And the apprehensions of the Lieut Governor were
      such, that he thought it adviseable to send back the Store Ship, least she shou'd fall into
      the hands of the Rebels-She took her departure, but fortunately as the events afterwards
      turned up, was obliged to return, as the River was so much frozen up that it was impossible
      for her to proceed. </P>
   <P>In this very critical Situation, Captain Hamilton, since created a Baronet, and his Officers
      endeavoured to animate and encourage the Inhabitants to take arms in their own defence, by
      Offering to lay up the Frigate, and disembark his men to do Garrison duty, and to give them
      every Assistance in their power, for His Majesty's Service - At this time, <name>Lieut Col Maclean</name>
      who had crossed the country arrived in the Town with about 100 Men - His activity and
      exertions contributed to give spirits to the people, and rouse them from their despondency,
      and witlr so good an effect, that when Captain Hamilton met the principal Inhabitants to know
      their final determination, they consented to act in their own defence.</P>
   <P>Upon this a Proclamation was published, by the Lieutenant Governor and Captain Hamilton,
      laying an embargo upon all the Shipping in the River; and by way of farther precaution, his
      boats crews were ordered to unbend the sails and carry them on shore, to prevent such Vessels
      as might be so disposed, from leaving the place -</P>
   <P>The Officers and Men belonging to His Majesty's Ship the Lizard, the Hunter Sloop, and the
      Magdalen Schooner were immediately disembarked, which together with those from the Merchants
      Vessels, were formed into a Battalion of 9 Companies consisting of near 400, officers included
      - The Officers took Rank in the Marine Batallion respectively, according to their Rank in the
      Navy, and Mr Starke being then second Lieutenant of the Lizard, served as a Captain therein,
      during the Seige . . . They proceeded immediately to put the fortifications in the best
      possible state of defence; they cleared the ditches and the ramparts, and mounted thereon,
      with great activity and dispatch, the artillery; and constructed Barriers in some of the
      Streets, and other works to strengthen the place. </P>
   <P>While these preparations were carrying into execution, under the direction of Sir John
      Hamilton and <name>Lieut Col Maclean</name>, Sir <name>Guy Carleton</name> arrived at Quebec; after having narrowly
      escaped from being taken a prisoner, by getting into a Canoe, in which he came down the River
      from Montreal with much hazard, and immediately [as ]sumed the command of the Garrison 2 - The
      British and the Canadian Inhabitants were formed into Corps of Militia, which amounted to
      about 700 Men, which being added to Lt Col Macleane's Corps, and the Marine Battalion, made
      the whole to consist of about 1200 Men bearing Arms -</P>

      on you[r] Success, &amp; hope (As fortune has so far be[e]n favourable &amp; is generally so

      before the 18th to make an exact Scrutiny into the Arms &amp; Ammunition of my Detachment,
      When upon examination great Part of Our Cartridges proved unfit for service &amp; to my Great

      Attack Us - And as his Numbers were greatly Superior to Ours, with [a No field p]ieces the
      Limits of Quebec are so Extensive I found it imposable Intirly to Cut of [f] their
      Communication with the Country Without Dividing the Small Number of Men I have (abt 550
      Effectives) so as to render them an easy Sacrifice, to the beseaged, I therefore Concluded it
      most Prudent to retire to this place Untill I receive further Orders from you &amp; Orderd the

      !,make no doubt of you forwarding it as soon as posable - The Inhabitants are Very Friendly
      &amp; Give all the Assistance they dare to do at Present-had we a sufficient Force to Blockade
      the Garrison I make no Doubt of their Coming to our Assistance in great Num bers - As it will

   <P>Sir </P>
   <P>Novr 20. 1775 </P>
   <P>As the present seems the Suitable Season for Endeavouring to procure a Stock of Powder your
      Excy will indulge a few thoughts on this Important Subject, even though they should not be
      wholly pertinent. I beg leave to propose to your Excy's Consideration, that a good Schooner, a
      prime Sailor, should proceed as soon as may be, to Havre de Grace (in the English Channel)
      with a Suitable person on board (your Agent) who should !mediately on his arrival there go to
      Paris or Versailles, about 120 Miles, with Letters from your Excy to the Prime Minister of
      France, Requesting an Immediate Supply of Ten thousand Barrels (Quintals) 0f Powder, with one
      hundred Tons of Lead for the Payment of which the Continental Congress will make Provision.
      Your Reasons to Induce the French Minister to grant this Supply will so strongly coi~cide with
      the National Politics of France, it seems highly probable he will be glad of the Opportunity
      of Supplying or even of giving it, tho' in some covered way. If your Agent Succeeds, he can
      Easily procure under the Auspices of the French Minister. five or Six Vessels, good Sailors,
      of 100 Tons each, to bring the powder and Lead from Brest, or whencesoever the same may be
      Shipped. Each of those Vessels should have a pilot from the Schooner, which for that Purpose
      should be doubly manned with the best m~n: your Agent instructing the Masters and Pilots o the
      sd Vessels how to Con-'duct on falling in with our Coast. - The Reason for going to Havre de
      Grace is to have the shortest and directest comunication with the French Minister. The same
      Advantage cannot be had so well in Spain, as Madrid is so distant from the seaports. But
      another Schooner, alike circumstances, might be sent to Cadiz, and the business perhaps
      Negotiated with the Spanish Governor for a like Quantity of Powder &amp; Lead. - If not, your
      Agent might proceed to Madrid, about 300 miles, and Settle the Business with the Prime
      Minister, by whose favour he could Procure at Cadiz the Powder &amp; Lead, and Vessels
      necessary to bring them. - Your Excy will probably think, that your Agents should treat only
      with the Principals, as Sub-managers are Scarcely to be trusted in so Important a Business. -
      Two Schooners well fitted manned &amp;c might be happily employed in this manner during the
      Winter Months. - It might procure the Freight of the Powder on easier Terms if the French and
      Spanish Vessels were allowed to carry off with them American Produce. The Lead would answer
      for Ballast. The Agents should conduct with great circumspection to prevent their Business
      being even guessed at. Should it be k~own to the English Consul at Cadiz, or the Embassador at
      Madrid or Paris, or through any other Channel transpire, the Vessels will be stopt; or taken
      by English Cruizers, which will be sent to entercept them. - If both applications should
      Succeed, and the Powder and Lead Arrive in Consequence, the quantity of each will probably be
      little enough for the ensuing Campaign: as Ministry seems to intend it shall be a Vigorous and
      Extensive one. - -Your Excy knows whether firearms, Flints or tinplates for making Cartridge
      boxes, will be wanted. The Same Application will probably Procure them.-</P>

   <P>Sir </P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> Novr 20. 1775.</P>
   <P>Having in my Letter of the 10th instant only generally acknowledged the Receipt of their
      Lordships Orders and your Letters by the Phoenix, I intend this Letter as a particular Reply
      to such Parts of either as I think require it. Their Lordships directions in your Letter Sepr
      5 to land the private Marines from the Ships ordered home, until the private Men of the
      Battalions ashore are compleated to One thousand Men, shall be punctually obeyed; but I could
      have wished their Lordships had directed me to have compleated the Ships first, for, according
      to the present arrangement, it is probable that the Deficiencies in the Battalions ashore will
      always require more Privates to compleat than the number of Marines on board the Men of War,
      who may be sent to England. Their Lordships are so well acquainted with the use of Marines on
      board his Majesty's Ships, and at this time they really are of so much consequence to us, that
      it is with Reluctance I order them to be landed while the Ships continue short of their
      Complements. </P>
   <P>I am happy in their Lordships Concurrence with my opinion respecting any Ships or Vessels
      going to England upon the requisition of any Governor of his Majesty's Colonies: and I have
      accordingly signified their Lordships directions on that Subject to the Officers under my
      Command. </P>
   <P>Their Lordship's indulgence of Potatoes and Carrots will be extremely acceptable to the
      Officers and Seamen, and I shall most certainly endeavour to get them Turtle, Oranges and such
      other Refreshments as can be procured in the manner their Lordships have recommended. </P>
   <P>Agreeable to their Lordships directions in your Letter Sepr 6. I have fully considered whether
      an Hospital Ship would be of Service in the Fleet, to which I beg leave to reply, that I
      flatter myself Halifax, Boston, Rhode Island and New York, will in all Events continue in our
      possession; and that good accomodation and refreshment may be always procured in each of these
      Places for the Sick, (the present time at Boston excepted): But an Hospital Ship willbe useful
      to receive Patients afflicted with Epidemical Diseases, or those who cannot safely be trusted
      on Shore, or to move occasionally with the Squadron, and even to be constantly in Harbour
      will, in my opinion, be of considerable Advantage to the Fleet, and in hot Weather be more
      comfortable to the sick, who are not Scorbuticks, than their being on shore, especially at
      Boston, where I think the situation and size of the present Hospital is ill adapted either for
      the convenience or health of the Patients; but at present it cannot be enlarged. For these
      Reasons I am of opinion an Hospital Ship will be of Advantage to the Service, and I think the
      Empress of Russia Transport to be the fittest for that purpose of any that are at Boston. But
      I submit to their Lordships consideration, whether an Hospital Ship might not be fitted and
      stored during the Winter in England, and be at Boston perhaps at the same time [in the
      Spring?] I should be honoured with their determination on that Subject; and that by so doing
      she might be well provided with Medicines and necessaries, and every Material for the
      Accomodation of the sick, which cannot be procured here; and also have skilful Surgeons
      appointed to her, who being on the Spot would naturally furnish themselves with many very
      useful Articles this Country does not afford. </P>
   <P>The Falcon, Hunter, Senegal and Otter Sloops, are without Surgeons Mates; the rest of the
      Squadron are compleat. The Ships employed within the four New England Governments and
      particularly about Boston have by means of their Press Warrants picked up a few Men from their
      Merchant Ships, in lieu of whom I have generally given some of those belonging to the Ships
      and Vessels detained. We have hitherto avoided as much as possible entering American Seamen on
      board the King's Ships, knowing from Experience they will seize every Opportunity of making
      their Escape, or of assisting their Countrymen in Rebellion. I therefore hope we shall be able
      to compleat the Ships without being obliged to take Americans, or to have men sent purposely
      from England. But I shall from time to time put on board the Kings Ships going home as many
      Americans as can be conveniently carried; these I would humbly propose to be distributed by
      their Lordships Order among the Men of War on Home Service, those bound to the East Indies or
      Coast of Africa; but on no account to be sent back again to America. By this means we could in
      some measure drain the Country of its Seamen, who are generally sober, hardy Fellows, and
      furnish the Kings Ships with Britons on whom we can have more Reliance at this time than on
      native Americans. </P>
   <P>I beg leave to observe that by the true construction of their Lordship's Order dated the 2d of
      September, no Captain is authorized to detain any Ship or Vessel bound from the Colonies
      direct to Great Britain or his Majesty's Islands in the West Indies, or such as are returning
      from either of these Places to any part of the Continent; provided their Papers are such as
      the restraining Acts require: And that this Liberty evidently allows the Rebels to import
      Salt, Sugar, Melasses, Rum, all kinds of Cloathing, Naval Stores, and many other Articles they
      greatly stand in Need of, and which, if they are allowed to import, will enable them to carry
      on the War longer and with more Vigour than if all importation was totally prohibited. I can
      assure their Lordships that the Congress allow Provisions to be exported only for Arms and
      Ammunition, and for the Articles I have already enumerated, most of which they are greatly
      distressed for, and are absolutely requisite to keep their Army together. I therefore hope
      their Lordships will approve my deferring to carry the Orders abovementioned into execution,
      until I am honored with their Lordships further Commands thereon. </P>
   <P>We have had a remarkably wet Autumn, and lately so much blowing Weather, that I fear the Ships
      coming from England will be roughly handled; and that, the intended Reinforcements arriving so
      late, very little can be done this Fall. I am &amp;c </P>

   <P>An order was deliver'd to Mr. [Edward] Chamberlain, Master at Arms, on <name>Robert Towers</name>,

   <P>My dear Colonel</P>
   <P><name>Philadelphia Novr</name> 20 1775</P>
   <P>I wrote to Col. Tayloe two or three days agoe, from whome I suppose you have had the news, and
      intended by Mr Colston to answer your last letter; but an express from the Camp last night
      having bro't fresh intelligence I take the advantage of tomorrow's post to communicate it to
      you. The transports from Ireland with five Regiments compleat have arrived at Boston, a
      fishing boat, with 6 muskets took a schooner belonging to the fleet, loaded with provisions
      for the officers, in her were many letters by which we learn that the Roman catholic Lords,
      Bishops, &amp; Gentry are extreamly active in procuring recruits; The Protestants very averse
      to the business, many recruiting parties driven out of their towns, and even the lower class
      of catholics, show great dislike to it, but with the high premiums given by the Popish towns
      &amp;ca many recruits are raised, &amp; it is expected as many will be raised as will com
      pleat the number intended for the next campaign, which they say is 22,000. 5,000 Hanoverians
      are to garrison Gibralter &amp; portmahon, the british regiments there to go to England &amp;
      Ireland. I will not anticipate your reflection upon these infamous proceedings of the
      Ministry, but I think he must be blind indeed who does not see the design of establishing
      arbitrary Government in America; and unworthy the name of man, who does not oppose it, at all
      hazards. The establishment of Popery, will no doubt, be the reward of the exertions of the
      Roman catholics. We do not think the whole of these raw Irish will make a dinner for our
      troops, our only fear, is the want of ammunition, but we hope to be releived from that, before
      next spring our cutters have taken two more of their caitering Vessels one loaded with wood,
      the other with provisions. 600 of the enemy made a sally out of Boston, to carry off some
      cattle but a few of our men quickly repulsed them, with the loss of two of their men. We have
      heard of Arnold's being in Canada &amp; recd with open arms by the inhabitants, so we expect
      that Quebec, &amp; of course the whole Province is ours by this time. so much for news. I am
      glad to find that amidst all the breeches button making in Virga &amp; in spite of the Cholic
      you keep up your spirits; &amp; therefore hope you have defeated all the party schemes in
      Richmond. Lord Dunmore seems to be a little quiet, since the taste of Virga prowess at
      Hampton, we expect that Col: Woodford will keep him to his good behaviour at Norfolk - pray
      remember me to all my friends, present my best respects to my friend <name>Mr Carter</name> &amp; his Lady,
      &amp; believe me allways [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Philadelphia, November 20.</P>
   <P>By advice received on Friday from Cambridge, we learn that a vessel, said to be from
      Philadelphia for Boston, was wrecked near Plymouth, she had on board 120 pipes of wine, 118 of
      which, with the crew, are saved; Also a vessel bound from Boston with about 240 1. value in
      dry goods, was cast away at the same time near Beverly; 1 the wine and goods are ordered to
      Cambridge for sale, the prisoners and papers were also expected in a few days.</P>
   <P>We also learn that the armed schooner Lynch [sic Warren] commanded by Capt. Adams, had taken a
      transport laden with wood bound for Boston.2 That <name>Capt Coit</name>, in the armed schooner Harrison,
      had taken two schooners, one of 90 the other of 85 tons, bound from <name>Nova Scotia</name> to Boston,
      laden with hay, live stock, poultry, &amp;c. both which were safely moored in Plymouth

   <P>[Portsmouth, November 21, 1775]</P>
   <P>I am now my friend at the 21st of Novr have kept this letter open to this time that I might
      give whatever might occur before the post goes off; in the first place I am to acknowledge the
      rect of your much esteem favor of the 26th ulto (Our congress was dissolved the 16th inst
      Precepts are issued to call a new one the 21st next month. God grant the next may be composed
      of better men than the last. A certain Puppy (a member for portsmo) who you know never acted
      on any just principle, (notwithstanding his insignificancy) has given much trouble &amp; taken
      up much time to little purpose. Many persons suspected of unfriendlyness have been arrested
      &amp; some of them after examination ordered to retire into the country under certain
      limetations. When this matter was in agitation a certain Quondam Colona! made his escape, its
      said is gone to Philadelphia; if that should be the case, I hope it will be properly dealt
      with, a greater enemy (so far as he knows how) don't breath American air; as you know the man,
      I need say no more of him. Mr Collector has also made his escape has not been heard of for ten
      days past: The 18th inst we received the joyful news of the surrender of <name>St Johns</name>, and some
      particulars of the friendly disposition of the Canadians towards us which defuses general joy
      among the friends of this Co. I hope it will not be long e'er we have that whole Country in
      possession or at least out of the possession of our enemies. Many of the enemies vessels have
      fallen into our hands, who were bound to Boston. &amp; I am in hopes, in the course of the
      Winter some of tliem will by mistake or some other means fall into this Harbor; if they do
      shall give a good account of them. I want to give you some particulars of the transactions of
      this Town, but must defer it to some future opportunity in the mean time be assured I am

   <P>Gentl</P>
   <P>Providence Novr 21st 1775</P>
   <P>As I had determined to take the Liberty to give you My Crude thats on some Matters by Genl
      [Esek] Hopkins, whose dispatch in geting Away gave Me No Time 2 - I now Imbrace the same by
      <name>Capt Whipple</name> 3 - The Importance of an Open &amp; free Communication from all the United
      Colonys to the Grand Continental Army by water thro' this Colony, tho' of but a Short duration
      would be of Vast Consequence, in Communicating supplys of all kinds of Provisns &amp;c from
      every Colony to the Army, would be giving all a Chance in that way &amp; wo'd prevent Any
      Jealousy of Undue Advantages, wch some to the Southward may think the New England Colonys have
      Over them - On the Other hand if the Isld of Rhode Isld should be taken possestion of by our
      Unnatural Enemys, (as Is Justly Apprehended) Consequently Connanicut &amp; all the Other
      Islands in the Nariganset Bay, said Communication by water in &amp; out, to this port would be
      lntirely Shut up, And this Colony Swallow'd up &amp; ruined, &amp; If the enemey should get
      Possestion As Aforesd, &amp; of this Town, its most natural to think, they would drive the
      Inhabitance from these Farms on the Sea Shore on both sides the Bay, In wch Case they would
      have Acquir'd Such Advantages as being in the Hart of the Country wch they Could not easily be
      removed from </P>
   <P>This Colony of it self is Insigniffecant Compaired with the whole, or some Single Colonys, but
      Its Communication &amp; situation &amp;c of the Utmost Importance - We are now Infested with a
      Fleet whose Commander is the most Inhuman of all Mankind 4 he has got Some of the best Pilotes
      for this Bay, &amp; the Coast eastward or Westward, perhaps that Can Any where be found, they
      have bin so long in the Colony that they have Contracted Such Genl Acquaintance &amp;
      knowledge of the Bay, that others might never be Able to Acquire As our late Colony Law agst
      Communicatins with the enemies will prevent it - I hardly dare Mention it, but by way of Query
      will do it whether Any thing better Can be done than first, with a United Force Sufficient to
      Come &amp; take all the enemy's Fleet in this Colony, wch you Must be sensible May be very
      easily done, wch together would make a Considerble Maritime force - This would give time to
      throw up some Considerable Fortification which would Enable Our Forces to keep possestion of
      the Isd of Rhode Isd Agst A much More Formidable Aray than at Prest &amp; profision for the
      Grand Army May Soon be thrown in for Many Months-</P>
   <P>It would take but few days to Come here &amp; accomplish the Work &amp; procee[d] after
      elsewhere, with the greatest ease. But if it be thought of Most Consequence to go Southward
      first, the News will Soon get to the Northwd And our Matropel[o ]us taken possestion of by the
      enemies wth Such a Force by Sea &amp; Land before Our Fleet Could return at the lnsuing
      Season, that it would be out of the Power of Our Forces to do Any thing with them - This
      Colony have done Nothing of Consiquence by Land As yet in its-Own Defence, &amp; I think
      Something of the kind recomended by the Grand Congress is Necessary for as yet they seem som
      what fearfull of the Expence, Tho' the Prest Comdr in Chief &amp; Genl Assemy are Harty in the
      Cause as Any Goverment - But it May be worth Considering whither there ought Not to be
      Someplace in the Governmt (if passable) made lntirly Secure, as a place of resort &amp;c. Our
      Furnace Cos Letr to Mr [Stephen] Hopkins, A few days ago will Inform you of the Governmt Apotg
      a Comtt to Treat Abot Some Cannon to be made here, or got else where; But as we that are new
      in the Affair Cant Make them So Cheap As they wo'd Come from England, fear they will not order
      Any, &amp; at Prest dont see that we Can give Any Other Terms than what they Can be Made for
      in the Western Colony - Therefore it Should be known as Soon as Maybe what they can be Made
      for there</P>
   <P>But what Shall we do for the One thing needfull, without wch Cannon will be of no servis -
      Have the Contl Congress who Sits at the fountain Head of Wealth, &amp; the Means of Procuring
      this Nessary Articles by Sending in to all parts of the World where its to be had - as the
      West lndias has been Sufficiently provd to fail, Several Voyages we have as Merchts bin
      consern'd in that Way, wch have lntirly faild tho' unlimited orders as to Price, &amp; One
      Vessel now Out there on the Govermt Acct that has bin gone long enough to-have got a lode from
      France or Spain - A Brigg of Brothr Jno Browns bro't in lately from Surinam A bot 45 C wch was
      all she Could get (as the Dutch are bot of [f]), tho' there was provisn made by Several
      Merchts to purchased a large Quy to be Bro't by her if to ben got</P>
   <P>The Salt Petter Buisness Seems from Any knowledge we have to be a work of Time - if any thing
      new Turns up to the Westwd we Expect it will be Pub lished, Our Assemy have <name>Appotd Jos Brown</name>,
      <name>Jabez Bowen</name> &amp; <name>Jos Snow Jr</name> to Carry it on - Is there any known place in Europe where it May
      be got with any thing we have to purchase it with? - Our Compy have now by them upwards of
      Eight Hundred Boxs SpermeCeti Candls, wch was all made from last years Stock, this would send
      for Powder Arms &amp;c &amp; Other Necessarys if permitted, to send them to the Most likely
      Places - this being An Article of lntire Superfluaty, would by No Means Strengthen the hands
      of Our Enemies or enable the West Indians in the least to keep back Any Assistance that Can be
      Expected by Any Means from them Carrying Hard Money out by Vessels in Balast, under pretents
      of getg in Debts Will be found to be of very bad Consequence as twill Drean the Continent of
      all its Hard Cash, &amp; have a fatal Tendancy to Depretiate All its paper Currency - If this
      be permitted by the Congress, as we know its Practised from Phia N York &amp;c, we Ought to
      know it, as its not bin done here or Stoped for the future every where -</P>
   <P>Our Assembly at the last sessions, Past a secret Vote under very severe Restricttions for the
      Carryg out of Produce, but to be under Bond &amp; oath not to return without the Amunition
      &amp;c as Stipulated, But since this a Resolve of the Congress Appears Agst Any Exportation of
      Produce Except from the Colonys - to each other without Orders from the Congress this Made me
      Mention of havg the Sperm. Candles &amp;c wch wod be App[l]yd that way if permited - If the
      Number of Frigets Come from Engd as mention In the papers twill be Allmost Impassable to get
      Vessels In after the Crewsers get out wch Makes it Necessry all Vessels design'd After Powdr
      &amp;c to go emediatly - Its hoped iff the Troubles are like to Convince the Congress will
      Negotiate in Person upon the Mattr with Some foureign Nattions by Some Gentln of sufficient
      Powers, Not only to get a sufficentcy of Amunition &amp;c but All Other Needed Assistance wch
      probly will Soon bring on a Quarel wch May Devert Our Unnatural Enemies Another way Ought
      there not be Some resolves, to prevent the Depretiation of paper Curry? Some of the So Colonys
      don't So freely take this &lt;Jolonys bills, Sho'd Not there be a Resolve to Make all passable
      in every Colony Might it not be best to Recomend to all if Colony who Sho'd Issue Any More
      Money during the prest Contest, to Make the bills to specifie So many Dolers as the Conti
      Money - wch will prevent perplexity in Assertaing the Value of any Colonys Mony - Whither it
      Might riot Ansr Some Good purposs for each Colony that Can get &amp; Spair the Men to Send As

      Vessels employed, and to be employed, at Barbadoes, and the Leeward Islands, and in the Seas
      adjacent </P>
   <P>PURSUANT to an Order from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty you are hereby required and
      directed to Seize all Ships and Vessels belonging to any of His Majesty's Colonies and
      Plantations in America, following. Vizt New Hampshire, Massachusets Bay, Rhode Island,
      Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pensylvania, the three lower Counties on Delawar, Maryland,
      Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, or are owned by the Inhabitants thereof, except
      only in cases where it shall clearly appear from their papers, or from other Evidence, that
      they are bound to, or returning from, some Port or Place in Great Britain, Ireland, or His
      Majesty's Islands in the West Indies; but you are. to observe that this exception is not to
      extend, or be applied to Such Ships or Vessels as may have Arms or Ammunition onboard; which
      Ships and Vessels are to be Seized in all Cases whatsoever, unless it shall appear, that the
      Arms and Ammunition have been Shipped with license, either from His Majesty in Council, from
      the Master General and Principal Officers of the Ordnance; or under the usual Clearances from
      the Commissioners of his Majesty's Customs: And you are to carry all Ships or Vessels which
      you shall Seize, in the Cases beforementioned into English Harbour, Antigua; there to be
      detained till further Orders, or be proceeded against according to Law, as the Nature of the
      Case shall require. </P>
   <P>You are likewise directed, to take onboard the Ship you Command, the Men belonging to Such
      Ships and Vessels as you shall Seize, from the Causes aforesaid, leaving onboard them, only
      the Master and Mate, and should the Complement of His Majesty's Ship under your Command be
      deficient; you are to enter on her books as many of the said Men, as you can prevail with to
      enlist for that purpose, and to bear the Remainder, if your Complement happens to he Complete
      to the whole as Supernumeraries, until further Order. </P>
   <P>And whereas it may sometimes happen that none of His Majesty's Ships&quot; are remaining at
      English Harbour, and the Master and Mate onboard such Vessels as are sent in there might then
      attempt to carry them away in Order therefore to prevent their doing so, you are further
      directed to unbend the Sails, and unhang the Rudder of all such Vessels, and send the same
      onshore to the Kings Yard; and you are to Seal up the Hatches, and take the utmost care that
      there is no Embezzlement of Stores, Tackle, or Rigging &amp;c. from any of them, for which

   <P>Whereas it has been found expedient to raise and embody a Militia within this City to
      co-operate with, &amp; to assist His Majesty's Troops in this Garrison in the Preservation of
      the City, and of the Persons &amp; Property of his Majesty's good and faithful Subjects
      resident therein against certain rebellious Persons who have invaded this Province, a Number
      of whom have lately appeared in Arms before the Walls of this Town; and whereas Information
      has been given me that some Persons resident here Contumaciously refused to enroll their Names
      in the Militia Lists, and to take up Arms in Conjunction with their Fellow Citizens for the
      Purpose aforesaid, and that others who had enrolled their Names and had for some Time carried
      Arms in the Defence and Preservation of the City have lately laid them down; and also that
      some Persons are busy in endeavouring to draw away &amp; alienate the affection of his
      Majesty's good &amp; faithful Subjects of this City from his Majesty's Person and Government -
      For these Reasons and in Order to rid the Towri of all useless disloyal, &amp; treacherous
      Persons, I have tho't fit to issue this Proclamation - And I do hereby strictly order and
      enjoin all and every Person and Persons whatsoever liable to serve in the Militia, and
      residing at Quebec, who have refused or declined to enroll their Names in the Militia Lists,
      and to take up Arms in Conjunction with his Majesty's good Subjects of this City, and also
      still refuse or decline so to do, as well as those who having once taken up Arms have
      afterwards laid them down and will not take them up again, to quit the Town in four Days from
      the Date hereof, together with their Wives &amp; Children, and to withdraw themselves out of
      the Limits of the District of Quebec before the first Day of Decr next, under Pain of being
      treated as Rebels or Spies, if thereafter they shall be found within the said Limits. </P>
   <P>And In as much as the Persons, who in Obedience to this Proclamation are to quit this Town
      &amp; District, may have bought up a considerable Quantity of the Provisions brought in for
      the Subsistence of the Inhabitants of the Town; and it would be imprudent to suffer those
      Provisions to be carried out, more especially as the Country abounds with the Necessaries of
      Life, I do hereby further order &amp; en join all and every such Person &amp; Persons to
      deliver in forthwith to the Honble <name>George Alsop</name> Esqr Commissary a true Inventory or List of

   <P>Sir -</P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 22 November 1775 </P>
   <P>I transmit seven private Letters taken on board different Vessels bound to Jamaica, which,
      besides the Intelligence of less moment, prove beyond a doubt what I have mentioned in my
      Letter of the 20 instant, that the Congress allow no Exports but in return for Arms,
      Ammunition, and such other Articles as the Rebels are greatly distressed for to carry on the
      Rebellion against Great Britain. You will also observe, in one of the Letters inclosed dated
      Philadelphia Sepr 9th that the Congress have granted a Bounty of £4 pr hundred Weight on the
      importation of Gun Powder, with liberty to export the Value of any Quantity thereof in
      American Produce; 2 Numbers therefore will become Adventurers while their Vessels can sail
      under the Sanction of an Act of Parliament, and the Prospects of Advantage are so
      disproportioned to the Risque of being taken; It may not be improper also to remark that the
      most handy and swift sailing Vessels, with their best Pilots, will be employed on the Business
      of getting Gun Powder &amp;c. And that the Plan of its being - received and accounted for
      whenever it can be landed almost ensures Success.</P>
   <P>It is needless to hint the Notoriety of American Vessels calling at the French and Dutch
      Islands, notwithstanding the Risque, and taking on board whatever those Islands afford, and
      they stand in need of: therefore in my humble Opinion nothing but a total Stop at once to all
      their Commerce can prevent the Rebels procuring Supplies and prolonging the Rebellion. I am

   <P>Sir, - </P>
   <P>I have to ask pardon for the wrong information I gave you. At the time of my last writing, I
      supposed the Machine was gone, but since find one proving the navigation of it in Connecticut
      River. The forcing pump made by Mr. Doolittle, not being made according to order given, did
      not answer; which has delayed him. 2 The trials I mentioned to have be,en made since Dr.
      Franklin's being here,3 was the explosion, which prov'd beyond expectation. </P>
   <P>I suppose he sets off this day with his new constructed pump, in order to prove the
      navigation, and if not prevented by ice in the River, will proceed soon. So far as you may
      have made known the contents of my letter, you may add this supplement. </P>
   <P>He is by no means discouraged in the attempt. I had not seen him myself since Dr. Franklin was
      here, as his movement I had only from common report, but have since seen him myself. But few
      know the cause of his present delay. </P>

   <P>JOURNAL OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS </P>
   <P>[Philadelphia] Wednesday, November 22, 1775 </P>
   <P>The Congress resumed the consideration of the report from the Committee of the whole, which
      was agreed to as follows:</P>
   <P>The Committee of the whole house, to whom were referred the several petitions from the Island
      of Bermuda, representing the distress to which they were exposed by the non-exportation
      agreement, and praying to be relieved in such manner as the Congress may deem consistent with
      the safety of America, report that they have considered the same, and thereupon come to the
      following resolutions: </P>
   <P>That the Inhabitants of the island of Bermuda appear friendly to the cause of America, and
      ought to be supplied with such and so great a quantity of the produce of these colonies, as
      may be necessary for their subsistence and home consumption; that, in the opinion of this
      Committee, they will annually require for the purposes aforesaid, 72,000 bushels of Indian
      corn, 2,000 barrels of bread or flour, 1,000 barrels of beef or pork, 2,100 bushels of peas or
      beans, and 300 tierces of rice, and that they be permitted to export the same yearly. </P>
   <P>That the said Inhabitants ought to pay for the above annual allowance in salt, but it is not
      the design of this resolution to exclude them from the priviledge of receiving American
      produce to any amount in exchange for arms, ammunition, salt petre, sulphur, and field pieces,
      agreeable to a resolution of Congress passed the 15th of July last.</P>
   <P>That, to enable such of these colonies as can conveniently furnish the Island of Bermuda with
      the abovementioned annual allowance, to divide whatever advantages may result therefrom, in
      proportion to their respective shares of the general expence. It is further the opinion of
      this Committee, That the Colony of South Carolina supply them with three hundred tierces of
      rice. </P>
   <P>That the Colony of North Carolina supply them with 16,000 Bushels of Indian corn, and 468
      bushels of peas or beans. </P>
   <P>That the Colony of Virginia supply them with 36,000 Bushels of Indian corn, and 1,050 bushels
      of pease or beans. </P>
   <P>That the Colony of Maryland supply them with 20,000 bushels of Indian corn, and 582 bushels of
      peas or beans. </P>
   <P>That the colony of Pennsylvania supply them with. 1,200 barrels of flour or bread, and 600
      barrels of beef or pork.</P>
   <P>That the Colony of New York supply them with 800 barrels of flour or bread, and 400 barrels of
      beef or pork. </P>
   <P>That the conventions or committees of, safety of the above mentioned colonies ought to
      superintend the said exportation, provide against frauds, and take care that, in exchanging
      the said commodities of salt and provisions, no undue advantages be taken by either party of
      their mutual wants, and further, that no vessel employed in this business ought to load
      without their permission, and that when they shall, in pursuance of these resolutions, permit
      any of the said vessels to load, they do give notice thereof to the committee of Inspection of
      the county, city, or town where such vessel shall load, and inform them that the same is done
      under the authority and by order of this Congress.</P>
   <P>That these resolutions ought to be kept as private as the execution of them will admit. </P>
   <P>That they should be transmitted to the several conventions, assemblies, or committees of
      safety of the United Colonies, and to the island of Bermuda; and that the inhabitants of the
      latter be informed, that the Congress will afford them other necessaries (such as lumber,
      soap, and candles) whenever the quality and quantity of each of those articles used in the
      Island shall be ascertained. </P>
   <P>That <name>Edward Stiles</name> be permitted, under the direction of the committee of safety of the colony
      of Pensylvania, to send the Brig Sea Nymph, <name>Samuel Stabel</name>, Master, with 4,000 bushels of
      Indian corn, 300 barrels of flour, 100 barrels of bread, 20 barrels of pork, 8 barrels of
      beef, 30 boxes of soap, and 15 barrels of apples to Bermuda, for the immediate supply of the
      Inhabitants, and that the said cargo be considered as a part of the annual allowance aforesaid

      strong for us &amp; we decided not to approach them and we reversed our course. At about 1
      o'clock in the afternoon we met <name>Capt Coit</name> commanding an armed schooner and we joined forces in
      order to try to defeat them; but we wasted our time for they were three altogether and as they
      seemed determined to defeat us and make us prisoners, we set our course toward land. <name>Capt Coit</name>
      proceeded much faster than we did; a frigate chased us from about three o'clock in the
      afternoon until the black of night and perhaps well into the night. We sailed toward land and
      dropped anchor three and a half hours after midnight hoping that the next day, the 24th, we
      would find close to us the frigate which gave us such a good chase the day before, but we only
      saw <name>Capt Coit</name> who had spent the night at anchor two leagues away from us.</P>

   <Title>COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS TO <name>JOHN HANCOCK</name> 1</Title>
   <P>Sr</P>
   <P>We arrived the 16th in the Evening at New Winsor, having been detained. part of a day by
      Baird, the morning following we rowed down the River about 8 miles to the Fortress in the
      Highlands, where we spent the day in making such Observations as we thought would be of most
      use to the Congress, &amp; wish our time would have permitted us to render them more perfect
      without interfering with the other commissions with which we have been honoured. </P>
   <P>We found the fortress in the care of Messrs [William] Bedlow, [Thomas] Grenell, &amp;
      [Jonathan] Lawrence, whom the Convention of New York had appointed Commissioners to
      superintend the work, wch was carried on under the direction of Mr. Romans, agreable to his
      plan presented to the Congress. </P>
   <P>The Garrison consisted of one hundred men, being the remainder of two companies from which
      drafts were made to compleat those that were sent up to the Northward while they continued
      recruiting; exclusive of these there were at the fortress 27 Carpenters, 16 Masons, 2 Smiths,
      and 59 Labourers a Clerk, and a Steward. </P>
   <P>We must own that we found the fort in a less defensible scituation than we had reason to
      expect, owing chiefly to an injudicious disposition of the labour, which has hitherto been
      bestowed on the Barracks, the Block house, &amp; and the South West Curtain, this Mr Romans
      assured us would be finished in a week, &amp; would mount 14 Cannon; but when completed, we
      consider as very insufficient in itself to answer the purpose of defence, tho it is doubtless
      Necessary to render the whole fortification perfect, but as it is the least useful, we think
      it should have been last finished; it does not command the reach to the southward, nor can it
      injure a Vessel turning the West point, &amp; after she has got round, a small breeze or even
      the tide, will enable a ship to pass the Curtain in a few minutes. the principal Strength of
      the Fortress will consist in the South Bastion, on which no labour has as yet been bestowed; a
      Vessel turning the Point is immediately exposed to its fire, the platform of this will be
      raised 57 feet above high Water mark, when compleated, which gives it an elevation of about 11
      degrees above the guns of a Vessel at the West point, supposing she carries them 12 feet above
      the surface of the Water, according to Mr Romanss Account. On this Bastion it is proposed to
      mount 11 heavy Cannon. The block-house is finished, &amp; has 6 4-pounders mounted in it,
      &amp; is at present the only strength of the fortress, the Barracks Consist of 14 Rooms, each
      of which may contain 30 men, but they are not yet Compleated for want of Bricks with which to
      run up the Chimneys. </P>
   <P>The Fortress is unfortunately commanded by all the Grounds about it, &amp; is much exposed to
      an attack by land; but the most obvious defect is, that the grounds on the West point are
      higher than the fortress, behind which point an Enemy may land without the least danger: - in
      order to render the Port impassable, it seems necessary that this place should be occupied,
      &amp; batteries thrown up on the opposite shore, where they may be erected with little
      expence, as the Earth is said to be pretty free from stone, this will indeed render our Work
      very expensive, but we fear nothing short of it will be sufficient to avail us of the winding
      of the river. </P>
   <P>Mr Romans informs us of a place, about 4 miles lower down the River, which is free from the
      inconveniency we have mentioned &amp; where the elevation is much greater, had we had more
      time, we should have gone &amp; examined it. </P>
   <P>We would submit to the Congress whether it may not be proper to send some persons better
      versed in these matters than we are, to take an accurate survey of the highlands, &amp; to
      pitch on those spots on which Batterys may be most cheaply expeditiously &amp; advantageously
      raised. </P>
   <P>We found at the fortress, </P>
   <P>8 9 pounders &amp; 6 Carriages Cannon Cartridges </P>
   <P>42 6 pounders &amp; 18 Carriages 400 of 9 lb </P>

   <P>43 Double headed 6 lb Shot l 70 lb Powder </P>
   <P>19 Do 4 lb Do </P>
   <P>These are all the particulars which our Short Stay at the fort enabled us to collect-we offer
      our own sentiments, in matters with which we are so little acquainted with the greatest
      diffidence, &amp; submitt them implicitly to the Cong[ress] but cannot help wishing, when we
      consider the importance of the object, that they would take the opinion of those who are
      capable of giving them more useful information </P>

      but day after day have I been delayed without a possibility of giting to Arnolds assistance -
      his last letter I in.close you together with one for General Washington - To morrow I believe
      I shall sail with two or three hundred men some mortars &amp; other Artillery. 'Tis with great
      indignation I hear <name>Lt Halsey</name> whom I left as assistant Engineer at <name>St John</name>'s to put the
      Barracks in a proper State for the Reception of a Garrison has run away without leave taking
      with him the Artificers I had left to Carry on the work - notwithstanding this behaviour
      deserves the severest punishment. I beg he may be made an Example of, he is a fit Subject of
      it &amp; deserved to have been dismissed with infamy for endeavouring to persuade the Soldiers
      to Return from <name>St John</name>'s &amp; not to proceed to Montreal Lieut [Charles] Graham of the 4 Regt
      &amp; Several others can prosecute him - It will be necessary to send hard money here
      immediately, as paper will not yet go down. Price has sent me £5000 York money, Walker has
      been so fortunate as to git home, being retaken in one of the Vessels. Poor Allen is sent to
      England in Irons, Should any accident befall him I hope Prescot will fall a Sacrifice to his
      manes-</P>
   <P>I sent by Mr Schuyler a return of Provisions taken in the Vessels 2 - I wish [Charles] Lee
      Could set off immediately for the Command here. I have thought of disarming the Tories in this
      Town. - not so much from any apprehensions I have of them as to quiet the jealous
      apprehensions of the troops - Several Commissaries &amp; other officers are flown without
      Settling their Accoun[ts] I hope those people will incur the heavy Censure of Congress - One
      Mr Waterhouse who was appointed by Col. Bedle [<name>Timothy Bedel</name>] and whose Conduct must be
      Enquired into, having I fear made great waist of Public Stores - One Mr Stewart who Acted at
      La Prarie, one Mr Power who acted at <name>St John</name>'s - Lt Col. [Seth] Warner I believe has large
      Accounts unsettled in short there are great abuses to be rectified-</P>
   <P>I wish exceedingly for a Respectable Committee of Congress - I realy have not weight Enough to
      Carry on business by my self - I send you the two Indians taken in Carlton's Attack, I forgot
      to make you this Present before-</P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>Boston 24th November 1775.</P>
   <P>By late Advices which I have received from the Earl of Dartmouth, his Lordship informs Me that
      Measures are pursuing for augmenting the Fleet in North America, and that you would be
      instructed to exert the most vigorous Efforts for suppressing the Rebellion now openly avowed
      and supporte1 in this Country that the Commanders of His Majesty's Ships should be directed to
      receive on Board, and give Protection to any Officers of the Crown, who may be compelled by
      the Violence of the people to seek for such an Assylum, and to proceed as in the Case of a
      Town in actual Rebellion against such of the Sea Port Towns, being accessible to His Majesty's
      Ships, as should offer any Violence to the King's Officers or in which any Troops should be
      raised or Military Works erected, other than by His Majesty's Authority, or any attempts made
      to Seize or plunder any public Magazines of Arms and Ammunition. After the many communications
      which I have already had the honor to make to you relative to the Proceedings and transactions
      of the People in the Province of New Hampshire which obliged Me to take refuge here, further
      Repetitions must at this time be needless to shew how deeolv they are in general unhappily
      engaged in this unnatural Rebellion; - -The great advantages which the natural situation of
      Piscataqua Harbor gives to the Rebels having already encouraged them, as I am well informed,
      to carry their Frenzy to so great a height as to erect several Batteries on different
      Eminences commanding the River to annoy the King's Ships, it is very manifest, considering the
      Spirit prevail ing in the Country, that a strong Force will be necessary to reduce and Hold
      pos session of the Harbor; - Such a Measure however, if effected, would, it is hoped, very
      much check their presumption, answer other good purposes conformable to His Majesty's
      intentions, and probably enable Me to maintain a Residence in the Province to Execute His
      Majesty's Commands as far as in my Power.</P>
   <P>Whenever it shall be your pleasure to adopt any plan of proceeding with regard to that
      Province, as it is My duty so shall it be my most hearty desire to exert every endeavour and
      Employ every means in my Power to aid and Support all such Operations as you may think proper
      to undertake for executing His Majesty's Orders and restoring the Authority of His Government,
      and be very happy to embark the first Opportunity of going to the Province whenever you think
      it expedient to send a sufficient Force there to Command Possession of Piscataqua River. I
      have the honor to be with great respect and Esteem Sir [&amp;c.]</P>

      Passes on Hudsons River he would have him retain a few Pilots for that River, and sent him
      Orders accordingly, recommending to him to co-operate heartily with Governor Tryon for the
      good of the Kings Service. He expressed also his satisfaction in the arrival of the Tartar and
      her Convoy, that he was in hopes too the Ordnance Brig was safe but heartily wished she was
      in, and added that his Apprehensions for her Safety had been considerably lessened since the
      sailing of the Nautilus, Canceaux and Hinchinbrook: that the Weather appearing to be settled,
      and the Opportunity so favorable for sailing, he hoped the Phoenix would get to Sea as soon as

   <P>As the contents of the inclosed paper concerns our common Countries, I have thought it my duty
      as a Delegate to Congress from Virginia to inclose it to you by the first opportunity. As Salt
      is now much wanted in Virginia and the Country has been favored with a plentiful crop the last
      season, it will be very convenient for both Countries that your Island furnish that article
      quickly as possible, and to the full amount permitted by the resolution of Congress. 2 The
      restraining Act of Parliament of the last Session does not interfere with you in this business
      yet it will be prudent to make use of quick sailing Vessels, and if a few guns &amp; men are
      put on board to keep off the small Tenders in Chesapeake Bay, that are every now &amp; then
      committing Acts of piracy, they might be of service. It will be the most safe to run
      immediately up York, Rappahanock, or Potomack, as the Men of War generally lye in Hampton road
      or about Norfolk. The Committee of Safety sits constantly, and means will be taken to give all
      possible dispatch to your business in Virginia.</P>

   <P>When col. Woodford had embarked his men at Sandy Point, to cross over to join the first
      detachment at Cobham, he was determined to attack a large sloop tender which had been sent up
      to prevent his passage; but as soon as the boats were manned, and had put off from the shore,
      the tender tacked about and ran down to Jamestown, where, being sorely mortified at their
      disappointment and disgrace, the man of war and tenders fired for some time with great fury at
      our men stationed there, and the next day they all fell down the river, to reinforce our late
      governour, at Gosport. This tender, in. her passage up the river, came within about 400 yards
      of the shore; on which capt. [John] Green, and ten of his men, gave them a salute, which so
      disconcerted them that they stood away, and ran aground [on] the other shore, where they stuck
      for some time. Col. [Charles] Scott, who was at Cobham, opposite to Jamestown, seeing a flat
      loaded wth oysters endeavouring to go to the Kingfisher, sent off a boat or two after her to

   <P>It is with the utmost concern that I acquaint Your Lordship with the distresses of the
      unfortunate people of this Island - On the 17th Inst two large Schooners belonging to
      Marblehead in New England, 2 came to this Harbour, the Crews of which came on shore, plundered
      His Excellencys House, stript Mr Call beck the Attorny General (who had then the honor of
      Command) and me of every thing we were possessed of in the world, This worthy Gentleman Mr
      Callbeck had stretched his credit to the utmost limits to supply an unfortunate set of people
      that arrived late in the fall amounting to One Hundred and three souls settled upon Lott No 5
      belonging to Messrs Smith &amp; Co, and with great difficulty had provided a sufficiency for
      that purpose which also the Rebels siezed and took away, together with His person and Mr
      [Thomas] Wright the surveyor General, upon whose arrival on board they dismissed me after
      having been doss confined 48 hours 3</P>
   <P>I cannot help observing to Your Lordship, Our situation as Gentlemen (appointed to employments
      by His Majesty) from the first establishment of this Government, has been so truly deplorable
      that in general we thought fortune had done it's worst - These late disasters however
      convinces us to the contrary. The coarse Provissions that our penury oblidged us to live upon
      before would be now lux[ur ]y being deprived of almost every necessary of life roots excepted.
      Your Lordships well known humanity emboldens me to beg your kind interposition with His
      Majesty to consider our disstressed situation and take us under His Royal Protection. -
      Immediately upon being released from my confinement I dispatched an express to Robert Stewart

   <P>3. Narrative of <name>John Selman</name>: &quot;the season coming on turbulent in this latitude, the people
      on short allowance, willing to do something, boarded two Jersey-men, todk the pilots out of
      them which was acquainted with the island <name>St. Johns</name>. Understanding by them that a number of
      cannon was there in the fortress and recruiting was going on for Quebeck, we with the advice
      of the officers supposing we should do essential service by breaking up a nest of recruits
      intended to be sent against Montgomery who commanded our forces at Quebeck, the winds came
      southerly, we went through the Gut of Canso with the two pilots aforesaid, declaring to them
      should they run us ashore death to them would be inevitable, they behaved true and honest.
      Tho' fall weather, carried us safe into the harbour by the lead and anchored us about a mile
      and a half from the shore. Broughton armed his boat with six men and took a southerly and
      westerly direction to the shore. I was to proceed to the northward, six men in my boat armed
      including the pilot, the people assembled on the Bank, the Pilot let me know the Governor
      Colbeck by a sign, I went and took him and sent him on board the Franklin with Judge Wright
      which as we were informed was the official officer swearing those men in behalf of George the
      3d for Quebeck. There were woollen goods &amp;c in the stores. <name>Commodore Broughton</name> called the
      officers together for the purpose of their opinion - where the articles were for the
      recruiting service it was answered in the affirmative they were taken and sent on board Brough
      ton's vessel and mine; the people being alarmed sent expresses over the island. Governor
      Colbeck and Wright interoession to be restored to their families, had worked up the human
      pashions in the breast in their behalf, they were allowed to go on shore that night and come
      on board the next morning; I verbally remonstrated against such conduct giving them the
      advantage, but on the morning'they came, on board and we put to sea ... at the island of St.
      Johns there was a number of cannon in the Fortress what with the alarm given and the weakness
      of our boats having only one each from 13 to 14 feet long - could not obtain any scows or we
      should endeavoured to bro't them away at any risk, it was judged prudent to spike them and
      come away.&quot; Salem Gazette, July 22, 1856.</P>

   <P>From my last, you may form some judgment of the disagreeable state of Mind I have suffered
      from the Commencement of my late misfortunes - anticipating your approbation, I have so far
      overcome the restraint I have long labour'd under, as to attempt again to write you - my first
      interview with Ayscough, after his discovery of the Letters I think worth relating - (if I had
      been subject to fits, I am sure he wou'd have thrown me into the most violent Convulsions)Oh !
      the damn'd, black, hellish, bloody Plots contained in these Letters! pray Capt Ayscou[g]h what
      do they contain? Oh too shocking to relate! treason! Rebellion ! Massacre ! (then beating his
      breast, with the most unnatural distortions of his face &amp; body) 0 my God ! it makes my
      blood run cold to think on it-for God's sake, Capt: Ayscough, if you have any compassion for
      my feelings, tell me what you mean-Oh! (beating his breast again) it chilled the very blood in
      my veins when I read them. there is a plan laid to seize &amp; massacre all the Officers &amp;
      Friends of Government &amp; all the Churchmen upon the Continent in one Night - pray Gentlemen
      is it a fair question, to ask if you are Churchmen? (<name>Mr White</name> said he was, I told him I was
      not) such cruel, black designs, never before entered the heart of Man - but Capt: Ayscough are
      you not mistaken? Of I read [them] over &amp; over again-I am not disposed to question your
      veracity, but if I had read it myself I would not, believe it. - pray Sir, whose signature do
      they bear? they are all signed [&quot;]<name>John Adams</name>.&quot; - I imagine at this time, he had no
      thought of their being published, &amp; was determined to make the most of them this may
      account for the apparent Chagrin &amp; disappointment of our Enemies at Boston, upon their
      appearing in Print. they had been taught to believe the most infernal plots woud be disclosed
      with these Letters, but to their great mortification, were obliged to confess (to use their
      own terms l - that they were very sensible &amp; consistent, &amp; discovered the author to be
      a capable determined, finished Politician. this had a very good effect upon my Spirits, &amp;
      I must own I felt no small degree of pride in being the Bearer of them-poor Ayscough in the
      height of his Zeal against your Letters, dropt, or rather bolted out, which I think in justice
      to his Friend, he ought to have kept Secret-he said they were acquainted with all the
      proceedings of the Congress notwithstanding their fancied security; &amp; then went on railing
      at our Members, who he said were pushing matters to extremes against the general opinion of
      the Body. he asserted that upon a motion made by one of the Adams's, leading to independence,
      Mr Randolph the then President, &amp; one of the New York Members, were so much disgusted,
      that they took their Hats &amp; left the Congress in resentment; &amp; that Randolph was
      determined not to meet them again. - upon our appearing to doubt the authenticity of his
      information, he declared he had it from the New York member himself he spoke highly in the
      praises of this Member, &amp; added with a good deal of rancour, that the Congress were much
      disunit[ed], [&amp;] the appearance of uninimity, which [was] all they had been [able] to

   <P>On the 25th [of November] we saw 2 Vessels and a schooner, we set sail in order to overtake
      them. The first Lieutenant went on board and found that all their papers were in good order.
      One Vessel had a cargo of oil. The Schooner Eagle was on her way to Philadelphia to take on a
      cargo of flour. The other Vessel was a packet boat and we were not able to capture it. The
      ship's boat went off for about two leagues in order to see if any Vessel was about. Our boat
      returned around three o'clock after visiting two Vessels loaded with wood. These returned with
      the boat and entered Plymouth at the same time. We got the Brig under way and we cruised about
      one league offshore &amp; we saw one frigate which apparently wanted to give us battle; but
      she could not overtake us and instead captured two small fishing schooners which were about to
      sail for some harbor nearby. We returned to the same anchorage which we had left in the

   <P>Returning to Town from Haverstraw, 22 Inst., to which I had retired on the 24th Oct, I this
      Day visited Mr. Tryon on Board of the Dutchess of Gordon, whither he has betaken himself from
      the Packet to which he repaired 18th Octr upon Intelligence of a Motion in the Continental
      Congress to make him a Prisoner - He was at my House with the Family just before his Flight
      while I was abroad but dropp'd not a word of his Intention - ... He shewed me the King's Leave
      to withdraw for a Time dated the 25 Augt. and told me it came out on his own Representation
      made soon after his Return that he should be obliged to fly or submit to become a Prisoner. I
      advised him to make it public &amp; take the most of exposing himself to hardships &amp;
      Expenses in continuing here as a Check upon the Ships of War who might insult the Town. </P>

   <Title>JOURNAL OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS 1</Title>
   <P>[Philadelphia] Saturday, November 25, 1775 The Committee of Claims reported, that there is due
      to <name>Thomas Dewees</name>, for dieting the crew of the ship Rebecca and Frances, the sum of £16.13-
      44.4 dollars.</P>
   <P>The Congress resumed the report of the Committee on General Washington's letter, and the same
      being debated by paragraphs, was agreed to as follows: </P>
   <P>The Committee to whom so much of the letter from General Washington to the president dated the
      8th Instant as relates to the disposal of the vessels and cargoes belonging to the enemy,
      which shall fall into the hands of or be taken by the inhabitants of the united colonies and
      so much of the report of the committee of Congress, which lately went to the Camp at Cambridge
      as related to that subject, were referred, have examined the matter thereof and directed the
      same, as it appears to them, together with the resolutions of the Committee thereupon to be
      reported as followeth. </P>
   <P>Whereas, it appears to your Committee from undoubted information, that many vessels which had
      cleared at the respective custom houses in these colonies, agreeable to the regulations
      established by acts of the British parliament, have in a lawless manner, without even the
      semblance of just authority, been seized by his majesty's ships of war, and carried into the
      harbour of Boston and other ports, where they have been riffled of their cargoes, by orders of
      his majesty's naval and military officers, there commanding, without the said vessels having
      been proceeded against by any form of trial and without the charge of having offended against
      any law. </P>
   <P>It further appears to your Committee that orders have been issued in his majesty's name, to
      the commanders of his ships of war, &quot;to proceed as in the case of actual rebellion
      against such of the sea port towns and places being accessible to the king's ships, in which
      any troops shall be raised or military works erected,&quot; under colour of which said orders,
      the commanders of his majesty's said ships of war, have already burned and destroyed the
      flourishing and populous town of Falmouth, and have fired upon and much injured several other
      towns within the United Colonies, and dispersed at a late season of the year, hundreds of
      helpless women and children, with a savage hope that those may perish under the approaching
      rigours of the season, who may chance to escape destruction from fire and sword, a mode of
      warfare long exploded amongst civilized nations. </P>
   <P>It also appears to your Committee, that the good people of these colonies, sensibly affected
      by the destruction of their property, and other unprovoked injuries, have at last determined
      to prevent as much as possible a repetition thereof, and to procure some reparation for the
      same, by fitting out armed vessels and ships of force. In the execution of which commendable
      designs, it is possible that those who have not been instrumental in the unwarrantable
      violences abovementioned may suffer, unless some laws be made to regulate, and tribunals
      erected competent to determine the propriety of captures: Thereupon your Committee came to the
      following resolutions: </P>
   <P>1. That all such ships of war, frigates, sloops, cutters, and armed vessels as are or shall be
      employed in the present cruel and unjust war against the United Colonies, and shall fall into
      the hands of, or be taken by the inhabitants thereof, be seized and forfeited to, and for the
      purposes hereinafter mentioned.</P>
   <P>2. That all transport vessels in the same service, having on board any troops, arms,
      ammunition, cloathing, provisions, or military'or naval stores, of what kind soever, and all
      vessels to whomsoever belonging, that shall be employed in carrying provisions or other
      necessaries to the British army or armies, or navy, that now are or shall hereafter be within
      any of the United Colonies, shall be liable to seizure, but that the said cargoes only be
      liable to forfeiture and confiscation, unless the said vessels so employed belong to an
      inhabitant or inhabitants of these United Colonies; in which case the said vessel or vessels,
      together with her or their cargo, shall be liable to confiscation.</P>
   <P>3. That no master or commander of any vessel shall be intitled to cruize for, or make prize of
      any vessel or cargo before he shall have obtained a commission from the Congress, or from such
      person or persons as shall be for that purpose appointed in some one of the United
      Colonies.</P>
   <P>4. That it be and is hereby recommended to the several legislatures in the United Colonies, as
      soon as possible, to erect courts of Justice, or give jurisdiction to the courts now in being
      for the purpose of determining concerning the captures to be made as aforesaid, and to provide
      that all trials in such case be had by a jury under such qualifications, as to the respective
      legislatures shall seem expedient.</P>
   <P>5. That all prosecutions shall be commenced in the court of that colony in which the captures
      shall be made, but if no such court be at that time erected in the said colony, or if the
      capture be made on open sea, then the prosecution shall be in the court of such colony as the
      captor may find most convenient, provided that nothing contained in this resolution shall be
      construed so as to enable the captor to remove his prize from any colony competent to
      determine concerning the seizure, after he shall have carried the vessel so seized within any
      harbour of the same.</P>
   <P>6. That in all cases an appeal shall be allowed to the Congress, or such person or persons as
      they shall appoint for the trial of appeals, provided the appeal be demanded within five days
      after definitive sentence, and such appeal be lodged with the secretary of Congress within
      forty days afterwards, and provided the party appealing shall give security to prosecute the
      said appeal to effect, arid in case of the death of the secretary during the recess of
      Congress, then the said appeal to be lodged in Congress within 20 days after the meeting
      thereof. </P>
   <P>7. That when any vessel or vessels shall be fitted out at the expence of any private person or
      persons, then the captures made shall be to the use of the owner or owners of the said vessel
      or vessels; that where the vessels employed in the capture shall be fitted out at the expence
      of any of the United Colonies, then one-third of the prize taken shall be to the use of the
      captors, and the remaining two-thirds to the use of the said colony, and where the vessels so
      employed shall be fitted out at the continental charge, then one-third shall go to the
      captors, and the remaining two-thirds to the use of the United Colonies; provided,
      nevertheless, that if the capture be a vessel of war, then the captors shall be intitled to
      one-half of the value, and the remainder shall go to the colony or continent as the case may
      be, the necessary charges of condemnation of all prizes, being deducted before any
      distribution [is] made. 2</P>
   <P>8. That the captures heretofore made by vessels fitted out at the continental charge were
      justifiable, and that the distribution of the captor's share of the prizes by General
      Washington, be confirmed, which is as follows: </P>
   <P>That the share allowed to the captors be divided among the officers and men in the following
      proportions, viz: </P>
   <P>Captain or commander, 6 shares. Mate, 1½ shares. First lieutenant, 5 do. Gunner, 1½ do. Second
      lieutenant, 4 do. Boatswain, 1½ do. Surgeon, 4 do. Gunner's mate, and Master, 3 do. serjeant,
      1½ do. Steward, 2 do. Privates, each, 1 do. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That that part of General Washington's letter No 7 of the 11th instant, respecting
      the capture of a vessel by the Inhabitants of New Hampshire, be referred to the said
      committee, and that they report thereon to Congress. </P>
   <P>The Congress then took into consideration the rules for the American Navy, &amp;c., but not
      having time to finish them, Resolved, That the farther consideration thereof be postponed till
      Monday next. </P>

   <P>To the Public </P>
   <P>Whereas there has been a false report propagated concerning a vessel cast away on Chatham-bar,
      having on board a cargo of wines,1 and it is farther reported that the owner of said vessel
      gave the necessary orders for the Captain to proceed to the port of Boston, there to unload
      the said cargo for the use of the ministerial party, the following affidavit, he hopes, will
      be satisfactory to the public, and clear him of the supposed charge in the eyes of the

   <P>On the 25th day of November, 1775, before <name>George Bryan</name>, Esq; one of the Justices of the Peace

      time last aforesaid, by the direction of said Thomas, drew up orders for the direction of said
      <name>Perkins Allen</name> as master of said sloop, and that the purport of such orders was that said
      <name>Perkins Allen</name> should proceed directly from Philadelphia for Fyall, one of the Western Islands,
      from thence to Surinam, on the continent of South-America, and afterwards to the island of St.
      Eustatia; and from St. Eustatia to return to Philadelphia, with liberty, if it should be
      thought proper, to go to Curacoa or Jamaica; and that said orders did not contain any
      instructions, permission or mention of any touchiqg, calling, or sailing in and with said
      vessel, or of sending, taking, or carrying her cargo, or the proceeds thereof, to any port or
      place whatsoever in North-America, or in any of the islands thereto adjacent to the northward
      of Delaware bay. </P>
   <P>And this deponent farther saith, That the orders were written out. by this deponent at a late

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>The following Information, being gathered from intercepted Letters and other authentic
      testimony, we beg leave to lay the same before you; and hope you will judge it deserving the
      most serious Attention and lay the same before the Congress. </P>
   <P>That Lord Dunmore on the 14th Instant with a party of Regulars and a number of Volunteers
      Inhabitants of Norfolk had attacked a party of provincials near Kemps Landing when the latter
      retreated with the loss of a few Men killed and taken, amongst whom is Colo <name>Joseph Hutchings</name>
      made Prisoner; - that his Lordship had erected the Kings Standard in Norfolk; and proclaimed
      all Slaves free who would.join him and take up Arms; - that a number of about two hundred
      Slaves immediately joined him, and were furnished with Arms and ---- cro[w]ding to him when
      the Advice came from thence; - that the Inhabitants of Norfolk and princess Anne had every one
      appeared, and taken an Oath of which the inclosed paper No 1 is a Copy in so much says the
      Writer that &quot;Treason had not one Abetter in the extensive County of princess Anne;&quot;
      that on the 18th forty Volunteers and forty Soldiers set off to take possession of the great
      Bridge and that 100 Men were to join them from princess Anne headed by <name>Colo Jacob Ellegood</name>; -
      that <name>Colo Willoughby</name> had ordered in all the princess <name>Anne Militia</name>, and that the Governour was
      at the head of 1200 Men and it was expected in a few Days would have at least 2000 all
      determined to guard the passes to Norfolk and princess Anne Counties . . . His Lordships
      landed Force, exclusive of the Norfolk and princess <name>Anne Volunteers</name> and the Negroes, is now
      considerable: His naval force at present consists of four Ships from 16 to 22 Guns each, and a
      number of Sloops, Schooners and Boats; his small Vessels are often scattered and at a Distance
      from the Ships; and since he has attempted Expeditions on Shore, we learn that part of the Men
      belonging to the vessels are often absent from their Duty on Board. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Williamsburg 25th. Novr. 1775. </P>
   <P>Gentlemen</P>
   <P>As the Committee of Safety is not sitting, I take the Liberty of addressing you on the Subject
      of the unhappy Situation of our Country. Former Occurrances you are unquestionably acquainted
      with. A few Days since was handed to us from Norfolk Ld. D's infamous Proclamation, declaring
      the Law martial in force throughout this Colony and offering Freedom to such of our Slaves, as
      would join him. This contains the first Fruits of his Plunder from Norfolk and to you can need
      no Comment. It will surely be considered as an Object worthy the most serious Attention of the
      Congress, since all the Colonies are more or less likely to be materially affected by it. You
      will see an Account of the Engagement with the Militia of Princess Anne; the particulars we
      are not yet fully acquainted with, so totally is our Communication with that part of the
      Country cut off. Colo. Woodford is gone down with about 800 men and we are in hopes he will
      open it again and support our Friends in that Quarter. Report says that great Number's have
      flocked to L.D's Standard. The Tories of Norfolk are said to be the Ringleaders; many of our
      Natives it is said have been intimidated and compeld to join them and great Numbers of Slaves
      from different Quarters have graced their Corps. The Tenders are plying up the Rivers,
      plundering Plantations and using every Art to seduce the Negroes. The Person of no Man in the
      Colony is safe, when marked out as an Object of their Vengeance; unless he is immediately
      under the Protection of our little Army. They have many Prisoners of different Classes; Colo.
      Jo. Hutchings and Colo. [Robert] Lawson of Princess Anne are of the Number. These two
      Gentlemen were in the Engagement; Hutchings was taken on the Spot; Lawson escaped with a few
      friends to the Borders of Carolina, where they were taken by Surprize in their Beds. The Party
      we are told was headed by a Colo. Courtland of So. Carolina, who lately fled and join'd L.D. 2
      Old Capt. Jno. Gutridge and his Son William have been likewise seised. They have given mortal
      Offence in securing and bringing into us a little Gun Powder. 3 Are these things to be born?
      Engaged, as we are, in one general Cause, I submit to your Consideration whether it will not
      be prudent and necessary to make it a Point with General Washington to retain proper Hostages
      for the Security of any Persons that may be seised on any part of the Continent. I fear no
      time is to be lost, as we understand the Gentlemen and others taken here are to be sent to
      Boston to undergo what is infamously call'd a Trial . . . . </P>
   <P>I fancy my Opinion that a greater Number of Regulars was necessary for the tolerable Security
      of this Country will be found right. Neither Militia or Minutemen will do, expcept for sudden
      and expeditious Service. I can not doubt but that the Congress will see the Justice and
      Necessity of putting a sufficient Number of Men for our Defence upon Continental Pay; this
      will be a great Ease to us, tho' we ultimately redeem our Quota; it will also greatly
      facilitate our Intercourse and Negociations with the other Colonies. . . . </P>

   <Title><name>JAMES SULLIVAN</name> TO A COMMITTEE OF THE MASSACHUSETTS COUNCIL 1</Title>
   <P>Sir:</P>
   <P>Falmouth, November 26, 1775.</P>
   <P>Some time ago I troubled the honourable Board with two letters, wherein I aimed to treat of
      matters which I thought to be of great importance to the Continent in general, and this Colony
      in particular. but fearing that a further proceeding in that way might by them be deemed
      assuming and affrontive, and supposing that the benevolent disposition of your mind, would at
      the same time it pardons my intruding a long letter on you will induce you to lay such parts
      of it before the honourable Council, as will have a pertinent tendency to urge them to take
      under their consideration the importance of preventing the enemies gaining a camp there.</P>
   <P>But previous to my treating of the importance of holding this place, and as evidence to
      support me therein, I beg leave to give you a history of what has been done here since
      Falmouth was destroyed. Soon after <name>Commodore Mowat</name>, who burnt the town, had sailed for Boston,
      Captain Symons, in the Cerberus, arrived here, and demanded twenty sheep, two tons of hay, and
      twenty bushels of potatoes, as a reward for his sparing the few remaining houses; these were
      denied him by the people, and an alarm spread that he was going to land four hundred men; at
      the same time the people concluded that the Ministerial army designed to take possession of an
      eminence on the peninsula of Falmouth-Neck, for reasons and purposes which I shall hereafter
      mention to you, and apprehended that those houses which were spared in the conflagration, were
      intended for barracks, to which belief they were more especially led by Captain Mowat's
      telling a person, that he was sorry so many houses were burnt, as the saving more would have
      better answered his design; but the people still supposed that if the landing those troops
      were impeded by the Militia, they would endeavour to burn those houses also; this alarm spread
      into the County of York, with as much terrour as in the County of Cumberland.</P>
   <P>I, therefore, went with a number of men to contrive, if possible, some method to prevent the
      expected devastation in this part of the Colony; when I came to Falmouth, there were one
      hundred and eighty men there, including the sea-coast men (many had gone away for want of
      provisions,) the Militia there was commanded by Colonel [Jonathan] Mitchell, and Colonel
      [Reuben] Fogg; and a number of gentlemen were attending. They assembled, and chose me to lead
      them; an office the honour whereof I was as little ambitious of, as I was capable to well
      execute it; however, it being thought to be a post of danger, and as that modesty and
      diffidence which strongly urged me to decline it, might have been deemed cowardice, and tended
      to the discouragement of the people, I accepted it, and instantly determined to break ground
      on an eminence on the N eek, which overlooks the land for twenty miles round; but as Captain
      Symons had sent a proclamation on shore, that if we went to erect any fortification he would
      fire upon us, I thought he might annoy the people; and finding that there was then in town
      three hundred weight of powder, besides the small stocks in the adjacent towns, and two good
      double-fortified six-pounders, tolerably well mounted, I ordered the people in the night to
      throw up a battery on an advantageous point, near the ship, in order to combat her if she
      fired on the people, who were to intrench on the eminence. The zeal and resolution with which
      the people set about the execution of this plan was much beyond my expectation, but just as we
      drew to the designed place, the Cerberus, though in the dark, weighed anchor, and put to sea,
      but apprehending that she might return the next morning, we continued our labour all night;
      but she has not returned. </P>
   <P>On the 7th instant, the Convention of Committees of this County met, and though their
      proceedings may want some accuracies, yet the spirit obvious in them does honour to the
      County; and I, therefore, take the liberty of enclosing a copy of them. </P>
   <P>Since that time we have erected two batteries, cannon-proof, one bearing two double fortified
      six, and two ditto nine-pounders, and one three-pounder; and the other battery bears four
      double fortified long nine-pounders; all which, except the six-pounders, have been mounted
      since I came here, and we have gratefully received some guns and powder from the General
      Court. Upon the eminence we have got a fort in great forwardness, and should before now have
      completed the parapet of it, had not the severity of the weather prevented us. This is all
      done by the Militia of these two Counties, with some assistance from the sea-coast men. The
      Militia readily attended with their provisions, tools, &amp;c. </P>
   <P>There is still wanted a redoubt or two, and other advanced works, on the hill, which, with
      finishing the citadel, must be dderred until the weather is more favourable. </P>
   <P>We much rejoice at the appointment of General Frye, who arrived here yesterday, and have the
      highest expectation, from his acknowledged ability and integrity, provided he was in such a
      situation as would render him active; but I am sorry to say that the General Court has
      commanded him to fight with his hands bound. In his appointment over the Militia, he is
      confined to the County of Cumberland, and all his operations are limited to that place, while
      the County of York are as much interested in, and anxiously concerned for the defence of
      Falmouth-Neck, as the County of Cumberland. This seems an effectual bar to that union of the
      Counties, which, at this time, is so absolutely necessary; he, therefore, should have been,
      and I hope yet will be appointed Major-General of the Militia in these two, if not in the
      lower County. And when this is done, unless the Militia is organized, as I hope soon it will
      be, he had as good try to command the sea, as them in time of action. In his other department,
      as commander of two hundred and fifty sea-coast men, whose time expires within one month, he
      can do nothing to the purpose, but if there should four hundred marines be landed, must fall a
      sacrifice, before any considerable number of our scattering Militia could be collected to
      reinforce him. Besides this, when he calls the Militia, (and if they should obey him,) he has
      no way to find them provision, or any authority to provide one single necessary for his
      formidable army of two hundred and fifty men. This is the situation of this honourable
      gentleman, which I should not have mentioned, if I had not the honour to belong to the
      Assembly. </P>
   <P>Now, sir, what remains, is to show you why I apprehend that there is danger of the enemy's
      taking this post, and what I supposed to be a rational plan to prevent so great a calamity;
      but I must beg your pardon for this prolixity, which is not occasioned by the love of writing,
      but by the regard I have for the people, and the cause they are engaged in. </P>
   <P>This is undoubtedly one of the best harbours in the Continent, and the only one for the space
      of two hundred miles, between Boston and Sheepscut, where a ship can now lie in safety in the
      winter, and could they be kept out of this harbour, our privateers might cruise in safety; but
      if they hold this post, our navigation is at an end, and famine is the consequence. </P>
   <P>If an army of fifteen hundred men should be lodged on the eminence before mentioned, with a
      proper train, ten thousand would not force their lines; and as provision for our sustenance
      cannot be raised here, we must come to them for bread; and where there is no army, or command,
      the slaughter of a few persons will bring many to submission. This observation I take to be
      founded in human nature; and it is in vain for people to talk of dying rather than submitting,
      for when we are famished, overpowered, or disarmed, we must submit, and are criminal in not
      doing it; and an entire submission of these Counties when the enemies are possessed of this
      ground, can be prevented only in three ways, to wit: by forcing their lines, destroying their
      navy, or watching their motions, with an army much superior in numbers to theirs. </P>
   <P>If the importance of these Counties are held as trifling by our Assembly, (as I am sensible
      they are not) they will be so with the Continental Congress, and the possession of them by our
      enemies will make a vast odds in the war; for, beside the distress of the people here, the
      Ministerial army will be able to furnish the West-Indies with lumber, their several
      detachments with beef, wood, greens, roots, &amp;c., &amp;c., and the Tories now starving in
      Boston, with comfortable dwellings and farms. These things appear to me to be a sufficient
      inducement to the Regulars, while they can gain and hold so important a post with a thousand
      men, to do it; and if they do, we must inevitably submit, or carry famine with us to the
      westward of Merrimack-River. </P>
   <P>This can never be prevented but by an expence which ought to, and I doubt not will be borneby
      the Continent. It would be cruel to expect the Militia, either to complete or defend the works
      begun, for in a small space of time after a fleet appears in sight, with a good wind, the
      soldiers may be landed and formed, and the assembling a body of the Militia in this country,
      where the inhabitants are scattering, is a work of time; and therefore, the most rational plan
      in my mind is the having a garrison of one thousand men here, under General Frye, and the
      Militia in these three Counties, organized in small regiments and companies, under his
      command, and then I dare be answerable for his success. This expense may be lightened by
      having no other sea-coast men from York to Kennebeck, where there is now four hundred, except
      what the General shall send on scouting parties. </P>
   <P>I am informed that General Washington has said, that if the General Court would request it, he
      would send a regiment here; it is true that as the season now is, there can be little done at
      fortification, but there must be a vast many pickets got this winter, to enable a thousand men
      to defend this post in the spring, while the Militia may be gathering to reinforce them, and
      flat-bottomed boats should be provided to transport the Militia over the water here, and in
      this way General Frye may employ his forces this winter, so as to be able to receive an attack
      in the spring. I am, sir, with the greatest respect [&amp;c.] </P>

      Nantasket; there cut out a brig loaded with provisions and stores belonging to the king;
      brought her out, and sent her to the northward. The privateer stood to the southward; she was

      her, especially as it will serve to shew the Condition of the Cerberus from one Months Cruise
      on the Coast so early as November, as all the other cruizing Vessels suffered in proportion
      and much more when the Frost set in.</P>
   <P>The General having again expressed his Apprehensions for the Safety of the Vessels expected
      with Stores, Provisions and Forage from all Parts, and acquainted tlie Admiral that it had
      been reported one Ship had the day before with Difficulty escaped from two Privateers out of
      Marblehead, and therefore proposed for Frigates to be at Marblehead and <name>Cape Anne</name>, thinking
      they would there be more serviceable than Cruizers, and further informed the Admiral, that he
      had intelligence of three armed Vessels being fitted out from Plymouth,</P>
   <P>The Hinchinbrook chased a Schooner into <name>Cape Anne</name> Harbour and fired 40 Shot at her. A
      Transport had been attacked in the Bay about two days ago, and Captain Parker ordered the
      Raven to slip and run out to her assistance; The Empress of Russia armed Transport did the
      same, and both were so brisk that they arrived time enough to save the Transport, but the
      Privateer got off. The Master of the Transport had the Precaution to cut his jeers, Topsail
      Halliards &amp;c. The Raven returned to Nantasket. 2</P>
   <P>The Fowey and Francis Transport with Stores from Halifax came in last night, and by the Fowey
      the Admiral received Advice from Commodore <name>Le Cras</name> of his Proceedings at Halifax, until the
      Arrival of Commissioner Arbuthnot, who superseded him in the Command, and at first had
      consented to his sailing for England according to the Admirals Directions, but the next day
      gave him an Order to remain. The Commissioner himself also by Letter, notifying his Arrival at
      Halifax on the 1st of November, acquainted the Admiral that finding the Garrison there
      exceeding weak, and that the Governor had assured him it had only 126 Men fit for Duty, and
      that a Report prevailed of a large Body of Rebels being marched up the Country (their
      destination unknown), he had thought fit to detain the Somerset and Roebuck until he had the
      Admirals Commands concerning them. Mr Arbuthnot inclosed Copies of the Orders he had found
      necessary to give, and of the Regulations he had made for the better Security of the Yard; and
      that the Savage was just arrived from Newfoundland in eleven days, and had brought a Letter
      from Rear Admiral [Robert] Duff for the Admiral, which he had indosed; that Captain [Hugh]
      Bromedge had raised 84 Volunteers, Eighteen of whom, that came in the Savage, he had put on
      board the Fowey, and the rest were on board the Amity's Providence Transport which parted
      Company with the Savage three Nights after they left <name>St John</name>'s Harbour and was not then
      arrived: and that he had been obliged to supply the Fowey with Match from the Somerset and

   <P>Sir </P>
   <P>Boston, November 26, 1775. </P>
   <P>Your Excellency can make no request or proposal for the good of his Majestys Service that I
      will not readily attend to, and heartily assist to carry into execution, whenever there is a
      Probability of Success. Before and since I had the Honour of your Letter, I have been making
      the most diligent Enquiries about Marblehead and <name>Cape Anne</name> Harbours. At Marblehead I am
      informed the Rebels have a Battery of twelve Guns, two of them 18 Pounders the rest of less
      Calibre; they have also partly fortified <name>Cape Anne</name>. Frigates cannot be in either, without
      being expcy,ed to certain destruction: At <name>Cape Anne</name> the outer Road is foul, narrow and greatly
      exposed, and a Ship once into the inner Road cannot get out again without a leading Wind; the
      Enemy would naturally forbear annoying her while the Wind continued favourable to depart, but
      the moment it became contrary the worst consequences might be apprehended: nearly the same
      Danger attends lying at Marblehead.</P>
   <P>It is indeed beyond dispute that the Rebels have several small Cruizers in the Bay, who have
      every advantage over the Kings Ships in point of sailing; and being light Vessels, drawing
      little Water, the whole Country their Friends, can lie under the Land, and, upon observing a
      Vessel or two unguarded, dart upon them suddenly, and carry them off even in sight of the
      King's Ships.</P>
   <P>All the Vessels now cruizing in the Bay, which are the Mercury, Nautilus, Canceaux and
      Hinchinbrook, have Orders to go into <name>Cape Anne</name> and Marblehead Harbours, and if possible
      destroy or cut out every Vessel they find there; but my late Intelligence from these places
      gives me no Hope of their succeeding.</P>
   <P>The Advantages your Excellency mentions would undoubtedly result from the Kings Ships being
      able to lie constantly in Marblehead and <name>Cape Anne</name> Harbours. I therefore humbly propose as the
      only means of effecting it to destroy both Towns as soon as possible. Your Excellency is so
      much better qualified than I am to judge of the Numbers necessary for such an Expedition that
      I give my opinion with the greatest Deference; but I humbly apprehend three hundred Soldiers,
      with two good Frigates, would seize the battery at Marblehead and destroy if not bring away
      the Guns; and with a little Assistance from the Artillery bum the Town. And I also submit to
      your Excellency's consideration whether we could not with a thousand Men seize, and keep
      Possession of the Peninsula of <name>Cape Anne</name>. The Harbours would then be Ours. I am &amp;c. </P>

   <P>Nantasket 26 November 1775</P>
   <P>The Wind continued to blow at Et and ESE and drove me to the Southward of Cape Cod, off which
      place the 8th instant I saw tw9 Sail, a Brig and a Snow, but from the Badness of the Weather
      could not b9ard them until next day, when I found the Brig was laden with military Stores, 2
      and the Snow* with Coals for Boston. I immediately sent them Signals and took Charge of them.
      The next day I spoke to a Ship* from Liverpool with Coals to whom I gave Signals likewise.
      From the 9th to this day I have made every effort to get them safe into Port, have twice
      worked up into the Bay, and got within five or six Leagues of the Lighthouse, by our Accounts,
      when the Wind has shifted to the E.S.E. and with such Violence that I have been obliged to
      hawl the Wind and stand out, the weather being too thick to attempt making the Land. The Gale
      on the 10th shifted so suddenly from ESE to North that it obliged me to reef the Course and
      stand out, in doing which the Mainsail splitt from the Reefband upwards, but fortunately went
      no further. The next day it moderated and I joined the Convoy. On the 15th having run in with
      a Southerly Wind, and waiting for Day light to make the Land, as the Day broke the Wind
      shifted to E.SE again and blew with very great Violence and continued to the 18th. We lost
      Sight of the Convoy on the Night of the Gale, and have not since seen anything of them. In
      endeavouring to clear the Land we splitt a Maintopsail, Fore Course, and Fore Stay Sail: The
      Foretopmast Stay Sail blew out of the Netting and went all to Pieces before we could save it.
      We have broke the upper part of the Head and several of the Chain Plates. The Ship has been
      strained very much, and is very leaky in her upper Works by carrying Sail. A Sea striking
      under the Counter broke the Rudder Coat, by which means we shipped a great deal of Water in
      the Gunroom, which has damaged a Quantity of Bread stowed in the Bread Lockers. The People
      from Fatigue and being constantly wet have been very sickly, so we have had but few men who
      were able to stand the Deck during the bad Weather. All our Sails will repair again except the
      fore-topmast Stay Sail; but we shall want assistance in doing it. Most of our Sails have been
      destroyed by the Ropes breaking in taking them in, so that the Expence of Cordage has been
      considerable. </P>

   <P>Dear Sir, </P>
   <P>I am Sorrey to inform you, that the information I gave you, relative to the arrival of Powder,
      proved groundless. The vessel arrived which gave rise to the report; but brought none of that
      Article: She waited 36 days at Barcalona, to gain advice from the neighbourhood, whether any
      could be purchased; but none could be procured. The Powder in Spain was all in the King's
      Magazines. To add to our distress, we have lost Judge [James] Livingstons Mill, by the
      Carelesness of two men, who fired off their Guns near Some of Pans in which Powder was placed
      to dry. We have been informed, that there has been a Considerable arrival of Powder in Phia.
      If this be true, Surely the Congress can borrow of them to supply our pressing wants, for what
      we have lent the Continent. </P>

   <P> . . . They are fitting out some Vessels here for the Sea, but their other Business is a
      profound Secret to us, tho' it is well known every Week in New York .... </P>
   <P>We had a small Importation of Powder here a few Days ago, &amp; 50 fine Musquets. - The
      Captain tells us a Vessel arrived from Europe with a pretty handsome Cargo of Ammunition, the
      Chief of which was taken by some New England Vessels who were waiting for it. If this is true
      it will not be long before you will have some good News to send us upon this Subject. </P>

   <P>In about six weeks or two months we shall have upwards of twenty armed vessels ready to sail
      from hence, two of which mount twenty-four guns, besides a number of swivels. </P>

   <P>Norfolk 26th November.</P>
   <P>On Tuesday the 14th of this month Lord Dunmore with the Detachment of the 14th Regiment that I
      have the honour to command, and some Volunteers, embarked in boats, &amp; after going up the
      Southern branch of Elizabeth river, we landed about day light four or five miles below the
      Great-Bridge with an intention to dislodge a number of men in arms from North Carolina, who
      had taken passession of that pass; but they thought proper to retire and disperse upon our
      approach. After directions had been given to erect a kind of wooden fort to secure the pass,
      we proceeded nine or ten miles farther to Kemp's landing whereyve were informed there were
      three or four hundred of the rebels ready to recieve us, under the command of a Colonel
      Lawson. When we arrived within sight of Kemps landing our advanced guard was twice fired upon
      by the rebels, who had concealed themselves in very thick woods on the left of the road, but
      upon our rushing in among them they were very soon totally routed. Their very precipitate
      flight and the closeness of the woods prevented our giving a much better account of them. It
      is said that some of them ran away even before the firing began. However, five of the rebels,
      that we know of, were killed, two drowned in endeavouring to escape across a creek, and by all
      accounts a great many of them were wounded. - We had only one Granadier wounded in' the knee.
      Colonel Hutchings and seven of the rebels were taken in the field, and Colonel Lawson &amp;
      eight others were taken a day or two after. For further particulars in regard to the above
      mentioned affair, and ,the consequences of it, I refer your Excellency. to the enclosed
      Newspaper.</P>
   <P>We took possession of this town the 23d Inst and are now busy intrenching ourselves in the
      best manner we can, as a large body of the Rebels consisting of eight or nine hundred men are
      within ten or twelve miles of us. - They marched from Williamsburg about a fortnight ago with
      an intention to pillage and burn this town, which however we shall do everything that is
      possible to prevent, and I flatter myself that our endeavours will be attended with
      success.</P>

   <P>Please to acquaint my Lords Commissioners [of] the Admiralty; that I received by the Packet,
      which arrived [on] the 14th Instant; Their Orders Dated the 2nd Septemr last, and your Letter
      in Addition, dated the 6th Septemr and pursuant thereto, have given Orders to the respective

      Cruelty &amp; Oppression &amp;ca&quot; and He requested, I would bring Captain Gordon to tryal
      by [a] Court Martial for said Offences. - I accordingly Suspended Captain Gordon from Command
      of the Argo; and Summoned a Court Martial for his tryal, onboard the Portland, the 20th Novemr
      Instant; (being as soon as I could Collect the Ships of the Squadron together for that
      purpose,) when the Court met, and finding part of the Charge proved against Captain Gordon; Ad
      judged him, to be dismissed from the Command of His Majesty's Ship Argo; and to be Mulcted,
      Six Months of his personal Pay. I have herewith inclosed [the] Minutes of said Court Martial,
      and the Sentence thereon; to be laid before their Lordships. </P>
   <P>You will also please to acquaint their Lordships, that in Consequence of said Sentence, and
      the dismissiowof Captain Gordon from the Command of the Argo; I have appointed Captain William

   <P>I have the honor to receive your Lordships letter of the 2d Augt last N 18; with his Majesty's
      Approbation of my Conduct in Causing the Oaths to be Administered to all Persons coming from
      the. Continent, and taking the benefit of the Trade and Fishery: as I have information from
      the General &amp; Admiral of several Suspicious designing men coming into this Province to
      Alienate the Minds of his Majesty's Subjects here: - I thought it most expedient to Obtain an
      Act of this Province for preventing any of those mischiefs which might happen, and your
      Lordship will perceive by the said Act, That Persons coming with an honest design and taking
      the Oaths prescribed by Act of Parliament, will be entitled to all the priviledges of the
      Inhabitants, and suspicious persons are oblig'd to give Security for their good behavior
      during their residence here, and as I had been inform'd by the Admiral, That a Traiterous and
      dangerous Correspondence was kept up between some of the Inhabitants here, a Clause is
      inserted in the Act, Subjecting all such persons to the same pains and penalties, as are
      inflicted by the Laws of England, against persons Traiterously Corresponding with his
      Majesty's Enemies. I conceiv'd this Act, very necessary at this Conjuncture, and hope it will
      meet with his Majesty's Approbation, and the Earlier such approbation can be obtain'd &amp;
      transmitted here, the more force and Efficacy it will have ... </P>
   <P>I beg leave to mention an Accident which has happen'd to a large French Ship which is now
      Stranded on Cape Sables of near five hundred Tons, from the West Indies, laden with the

      issued a Warrant to the Vice Admiraltr Court of the Province, Ordering them to Impower the
      Marshall to use every possible means for the preservation of the Vessel and Cargo, and for
      that purpose to Impress Vessels, and employ them therein and to prevent all Waste,
      Embezzlement, and Imposition: I shall use every other means in my power that they may be
      assisted in this their Calamity and Distress. I have the honor to be with the Greatest

   <P>Camp at Cambridge, November 27, 1775. In answer to your inquiries 2 respecting armed vessels,
      there are none of any tolerable force belonging to this government. I know of but two of any
      kind; those very small. At the Continental expense, I have fitted out six, as by the enclosed
      list, two of which are upon the cruise directed by Congress; the rest ply about Cape Cod and
      <name>Cape Ann</name>, as yet to very little purpose. These vessels are all manned by officers and
      soldiers, except perhaps a master and pilots; but how far, as they are upon the old
      establishment, which has not more than a month to exist, they can be ordered off this station,
      I will not undertake to say, but suppose they might be engaged anew. Belonging to Providence
      there are two armed vessels; and I am told Connecticut has one, which, with one of those from
      Providence, is, I believe, upon the cruise you have directed 3 </P>

      when the orders to intercept ships carrying powder to Quebec were received by Deputy Governor
      Cooke of Rhode Island. The crew of the Connecticut armed brig Minerva refused to sail and
      before they could be replaced and the Minerva readied for service the General Assembly ordered
      the brig returned to her owner. </P>

      Companies of the 17th Regiment of Foot, two Transports, having on Board four Companies of the
      3d Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and two Ships with Ordnance Stores, are
      safely arrived. The Brig Nancy, with Ordnance Stores, was spoke to by one of the Kings
      Cruisers the 15th Instant and is the only Ordnance Store Ship missing, that sailed under the
      Convoy of the Phoenix Man of War; but none of the Transports from Cork with the 17th 27th 28th
      46th 55th Regiments, have yet made their Appearance, except the Whit by above mentioned, which
      occasions some Apprehensions that they have been driven far to the Southward by the violence
      of the late Northerly Winds. It is much to be wished that they were arrived, not only for the
      Use they may be of, but on account of the advanced Season of the Year, and the Dangers Vessels
      must run by coming on this coast in the present Situation of Things, without Convoy or Force,
      and having no friendly Port but this to receive them, while the Rebels Cruisers are ever
      watchful to take the advantage of their Weakness or Necessities, wherein they have already
      have been too successful, and will probaibly do more Mischief, unless the Kings Ships can
      contrive to cut them off. </P>
   <P>A remarkable Instance of daring spirit was shewn on the 25th Instant, within a short Distance
      of the Light House, and within View of His Majesty's Ships, by a Schooner that had actually
      taken one, and would have taken two Transports, loaded with Forage, had it not been for the
      Vigilance of Lieutenant [John] Bourmaster, of the Navy, and Agent of Transports on this
      Service, who cut his Cables, rescued the Vessel taken, and drove off the Rebel, in an armed
      Transport, stationed for the Protection of the Light House. 2 </P>
   <P>The Light House at the mouth of this Harbour, so necessary for the safety of Vessels bound to
      the Port, is now, I hope, effectually secured, and a Detachment of Troops will be kept there
      for its future Defence. The Lantern is repaired, and was lighted the 23d Instant. </P>
   <P>I beg leave to Remark the great want of Seamen experienced this Summer, for the navigating of
      Transports, for manning armed Vessels, and Boats on particular Services, and on many other
      occasions, which induces me to urge the Necessity of sending out Seamen to complete the
      Transports to their proper Number, a Return whereof is inclosed. It is also to be wished that
      the Kings Ships had their War Establishment, as they would then be able to spare Men for extra
      Services, and not have the same Reason for Pressing out of the Vessels from Europe, and other
      Parts coming with Supplies for the Navy and Army, a Practice which mav greatly affect us in
      future, unless your Lordship shall be pleased to direct that Protections be given to Vessels
      sailing from Britain, and Exemptions to others who may bring such Supplies. </P>
   <P>Before the Departure of General Gage, an Expedition was concerted by the General and Admiral
      for the Destruction of <name>Cape Ann</name> and Falmouth, two Sea Port Towns on the Coast to the Eastward,
      that were distinguished for their opposition to Government. The Canceaux and an armed
      Transport, having a small Detachment of Troops on Board, were to execute it; from
      Circumstances it was found inexpedient to make an Attack upon <name>Cape Ann</name>, whereupon they
      proceeded to Falmouth, which Place after giving timely Warning to the Inhabitants for the
      Removal of themselves and Effects, was destroyed on the 18th of October, burning about five
      Hundred Houses, fourteen Sea Vessels, taking and destroying several others, without any Loss
      on our Part. </P>

   <Title><name>JOSIAH QUINCY</name> TO <name>GEORGE WASHINGTON</name> 1 </Title>
   <P>May it please your Excellency,</P>
   <P><name>Braintree Novr</name> 27th 1775. </P>
   <P>Since I was honoured, with your Excellency's obliging Answer to my Letter of the 31st Ulto,
      the Question has often occurred to my Mind, whether, Row Gallies might not be as
      advantageously employed, in the Harbor of Boston, as in the River Delaware? and the more I
      have thought upon the Subject, the more I am confirmed in the Opinion that they may. </P>
   <P>The Quantities of Provision that, in the Course of the Summer past, have been transported in
      Whaleboats from Barnstable, Sandwich, and Plymouth, for the use of the Army: The Successful
      Excursions to the Lighthouse and other Islands, by Detachments from the Companies posted to
      gaurd the Shores, and especially, the numerous Captures by our armed Cruisers, are striking
      Proofs of the Utility of a well directed Naval Force. </P>
   <P>Soon after the Whaleboats were procured, <name>Majr Tupper</name> was so sure of the Advantages to be made
      of them, that he repeatedly said, if he might have the Command of as many of them, as could be
      conveniently navigated by one hundred Men, with Ammunition and Provision at the publick
      Charge, he desired no other Reward for himself and Men, than what he could get from the Enemy:
      - The Difficulties under which the Army then laboured, was, doubtless, the Reason why he was
      not attended to: - Could his Terms have been complyed with, the amount of his and his Men's
      Wages would, not only have ballanced the Cost of the Boats and Provision, but have been a
      Saving of some Hundreds to the Publick, besides annoying and weakening the Enemy, and adding
      tq our Strength, in Proportion to the Success of the Enterprizes in which he had engaged: His
      Men insted of living in Idleness, the Parent of every Vice, would have been in Action,
      whenever the Wind and Weather permitted, and at the same Time, a more effectual Gaurd to the
      Inhabitants, than if they had been on Shore; as the Enemy would have been very cautious of
      landing, least their Retreat should be cut off. </P>
   <P>Permit me now, Sir! to enumerate some Atchievements that may, probably, be made, and some
      Advantages that, I think must arise, if the same Number of Men, or a greater Number than were
      this Year appointed, to gaurd the Shores from Cohasset, to Squantum Neck inclusively, were,
      the next year to he employed, under brave and experienced Commanders, in Row Gallies
      judiciously constructed, mann'd, and armed; with attendant Whaleboats, built square stem'd, a
      swivel Gun fixed in the Bow of each, and to row, each, with eight Oars. And, </P>
   <P>1 As our Navigation is in a Manner annihilated, the Crews, being Seamen, may be more easily
      procured, than so many Soldiers, and being collected at a Distance from the Places of their
      usual Abode, they will not be so likely to desert, may be better disciplined, and kept more
      steadily to their Duty.</P>
   <P>2 By keeping them as much as possible on ship board, to the Exercise of their Oars and Arms,
      in sham Engagements, whenever the Weather will permit, they will be preserved from Idleness,
      and have little or no Opportunity to do Mischief on Shore.</P>
   <P>3 If the Gallies are constructed to row and sail swift, they may take or leave at Pleasure;
      and consequently, in light airs of Wind or a Calm, every Cutter, Transport, or Merchantmen,
      found without Convoy may be easily taken. And I am not able to forsee any thing to hinder,
      their united Efforts making Prize of a 20 Gun Ship when becalmed, especially in the Night, and
      within the Limits of the Harbour.</P>
   <P>4 Since I began this Letter, I have been attentively considering, the Situation of the Ships
      of War and Transports now lying in Nantasket Road: - of the Rocks and Islands within point
      blank Shot of them; and I am not only convinced my Self, but, I am perswaded, upon Inspection,
      your Excellency wou'd be also convinced, that a given Number of Row Gallies, with heavy Cannon
      and brave Commanders, might force them to leave the Road, or make a watery Grave for them
      where they lye. - Be assured, Sir! this is not a Chimera.</P>
   <P>5 Were our Enemies forced to abandon Nantasket Road, might not the Narrows be immediately
      stopped, with Machines formed agreeable to the enclosed Draft, or any other esteemed more
      eligible? - Should they attempt to prevent it, by fortifying the adjacent Islands, they must
      divide their Force, and consequently, be so much weaker elsewhere.</P>
   <P>6 Were Vessels of superior Force, to pursue our Row Gallies without the Light house, as they
      ought never to go far from Shore, they may easily escape into Cohasset, or Scituate, which are
      inaccessrble by Vessels of any considerable Draught of Water: If pursued within the Harbor,
      they may soon run out of Danger into shoal Water, where, shou'd the Enemy follow they might by
      runing aground, insted of being Captors become a Prize.</P>
   <P>7 Should your Excellency determine upon fortifying Nantasket or any of the Islands, every
      thing necessary for the Purpose, may be shiped on board the Row Gallies, and transported
      wherever they are wanted, with little or no Hazard of being intercepted by the Enemy. </P>
   <P>Upon the Whole: Permit me Sir, to conclude as I began that, the more I contemplate the
      Subject, the more I am confirmed in the Opinion, that Row Gallies may be as advantageously
      employed in the Harbor of Boston as in the River Delaware: - If the same Conclusion for the
      Reasons above assigned, should be the Result of your Excellency's Deliberations upon the
      Subject, and you should determine upon building a Number of them; the sooner the places where
      they are to be built, are pitched upon; the Materials collected, and the Tradesmen contracted
      with, the greater the Probability of their being finished by the Time they are wanted: - On
      the contrary: If your Excellency should view the Subject in a different Light, and the Result
      of your Deliberations upon it should be the reverse of mine; I am all Submission; and only
      beg, that, the Rectitude of niy Intentions may, at least, secure your Excellency's favourable
      Opinion of, [&amp;c.] </P>
   <P><name>Josiah Quincy</name> </P>
   <P>P: S: I forgot to observe that some of the Advantages of attendant Whaleboats wou'd be making
      sudden Excursions in Calms upon unarmed Vessels; preventing their Crews from escaping in
      Boats, and towing the Gallies whenever they wanted Assistance. </P>

   <P>The wind is not so strong as before but blows from the same direction. The weather is cold and
      covered. Our longboat went out to investigate a vessel that we had seen in the morning. At one
      o'clock in the afternoon our longboat came back with a vessel of about 80 tons laden with
      wood, hay, cheese, potatoes, turnips, cabbage, hens, turkeys, geese and ducks and other goods.
      All this was of very little value. 2 The Captain and myself went ashore in order to entrust
      our prize to the person appointed by General Washington who would take care of the sale and
      give us the proceeds. We came back on board immediately. </P>

   <P>Last Wednesday [November 22] arrived here from Georgia, Mr. <name>John Lewis</name>, who sometime past
      sailed from this colony in a small sloop, Capt. <name>John Wanton</name>, loaded with apples, cyder,
      &amp;c. bound to Georgia; but off Charlestown, SouthCarolina, in a fog, they fell in with the
      Tamer sloop of war, on board of which was Governor Campbell of South-Carolina; who brought
      Capt. Wanton to, took out some of his apples, &amp;c. told him he was a good prize, and put on
      board the gunner of fort Johnston, (who made his escape from said fort when the Carolina
      people took possession of it) and one. hand more, with two chests of arms, and two trunks of
      pistols and cutlasses, leaving Capt. Wanton and his men on board, and gave the gunner orders
      to go to St. Augustine for 200 men to come to South-Carolina to retake fort Johnston. When
      they got out of sight of the Tamer, Capt. Wan ton and his men shut the gunner down in the
      hold, carried the vessel into Georgia, and informed the committee of that place with their
      proceedings, who treated them very genteely; they valued the arms, &amp;c. at 200 £. sterling.
      On examining the gunner, they found he had a letter from Governor Campbell, which they sent to
      the [South Carolina Provincial] Congress, contents unknown. 1 </P>
   <P>Yesterday morning arrived from Boston, the Swan sloop of war, Capt. Ayscough, with a large
      armed schooner, a small armed sloop, and a large transport snow. - Soon after these vessels
      arrived, some officers and men came ashore on the Long-Wharf, with several instruments, and
      took a survey of this harbour.</P>
   <P>Besides the above vessels, there are now in this harbour, the Rose, Glasgow, a bomb-brig of 10
      or 12 guns, an armed schooner, and two small armed sloops. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Tyonderoga Novr 27th 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir, </P>
   <P>In my Letter of the 20th instant I observed that about six hundred &amp; fifty or seven
      hundred Troops raised in Connecticut remained in Canada. I have not had a Return from thence
      but from the best Information I have been able to procure and from former returns I am
      convinced they do not exceed two hundred, the in closed State (tho' imperfect) will exhibit
      nearly our Force in Canada.</P>
   <P>It may be asked why [Seth] Wamers Regiment were suffered to come away &amp; some other of the
      Troops raised in this Colony, as the Term for which they were engaged would not expire until
      the last Day of next Month? The unhappy Cause is this, At <name>St Johns</name> the Connecticut Troops were
      so very importunate to return Home, that General Montgomery was under the Necessity of
      promissing, That all those that would follow him to Montreal should have Leave to return home
      this Declaration he could not confine to the Connecticut Troops as such a Discrimination would
      have been Odious. - It might have been expected that Men influenced by a Sense of Liberty
      would not have required such a Promise, and that Others to whom it was not immediately
      intended would not have taken the Advantage of It, but all this.Flows from the same unhappy
      Source with the other Disorders too, too prevalent in our Troops, a Want of Subordination
      &amp; Discipline, an Evil which may prove fatal to Us. </P>
   <P>Few of the Troops now in Canada will be able to come Away, until they can cross upon the Ice.
      But as soon as that happens, I believe the greater Part will return; And should we not be able
      to possess ourselves of Quebec, Which it is probable we will not, if Colo: Arnold me[e]t[s]
      with any Opposition as the Weather has been so excessively severe that No Troops could lay
      out, the Consequences may be very deplorable, perhaps It may be thought necessary all
      Circumstances considered to raise three Thousand Men in Pensylvania &amp; New Jersey &amp;
      order them to rendezvous with all possible Dispatch at Albany to prepare and be ready to march
      as soon as the Lakes are passeble, Conducted by whatever Officer Congress shall appoint to
      command in that Quarter. </P>
   <P>General Washington writes me that he is in very great Want of Powder, Lead, Mortars, Cannon
      &amp; most Sorts of Artillery Stores &amp; begs that I will send him all that can be spared
      from this Quarter. What Operations Congress may intend to carry on this Way, I do not know,
      &amp; consequently cannot determine If any can be spared. - But at present none can be sent,
      as we must wait until <name>Lake George</name> is frozen over in Order to transport them, the little Powder
      here is going to New York agreeable to the Order of Congress. Lead we have little left, and
      all the Ordinance &amp; Military Stores in Canada are either carried off or destroyed by Genl
      Carlton Except what was taken at <name>St Johns</name> &amp; what was sent from hence. </P>
   <P>As the Ministry seem determined to carry on the War with Spirit, - Would it not be adviseable
      as soon as there is good Sledding, to remove all the Prisoners from Connecticut to some of the
      Interior Towns in Pensyvlenia, both because It will enable the former Colony to oppose more
      Men, &amp; save the Expence of transporting Provisions from Hudsons River for the Supply of
      the Eastern Armies, Which I think I can foresee must be the Case in the next Campaign. </P>
   <P>27th 2 o'Clock, I have this Moment received a Letter from General Montgomery, Copy of which I
      do Myself the Honor to inclose You in a Note of the 20th he advises me that he hoped to
      proceed towards Quebec the next Day, But complains that the Troops leave him in great Numbers
      and of the Green Mountain Boys especially, who had promised to go down with him. </P>
   <P>I am informed, that all the Vessels in which Mr Carlton had embarked himself, his Troops &amp;
      Stores, have surrendered by Capitulation; That <name>Carlton Got</name> on Shore &amp; was gone towards
      Quebec I believe It to be true &amp; hope soon to give You authentic Intelligence of It. </P>
   <P>The Schooner &amp; Row Galley taken at <name>St Johns</name> are just arrived here together with our Sloop
      &amp; Schooner full of Prisoners &amp; their Baggage, I am much distress'd to get them on, My
      Cattle fairly worn out &amp; only six Horses which I sent for from my own Stables, &amp; the
      Boats that go from the Landing to <name>Fort George</name>, do not return above once in Eight Days from
      Hence, as I have few Men there and the Troops that are going .home, will not by any Means send

   <P>By the last accounts, we have from Montreal, we hear that Montgomery had ordered a battery to
      be raised at the mouth of the sorrel &amp; got a Gondola from the lake into the river St
      Lawrence by which means has stoped nine vessels loaded with Stores from going down, &amp; am
      in great hope they will be taken - Carleton is said to have escaped by land to Quebeck, where
      we hear he has about 700 men chiefly of the Royal Emegrants (in which oure <name>Stephen Watts</name> is
      enlisted) &amp; they are employed below Quebeck in distressing the inhabitants who are
      favourable to us Arnold we hear is at point Levi waiting for assistance from Montgomerry who
      writes me that he will go down immediately if he can get his men to follow him in which we
      hear he is like to succeed - He proposes to secure the channel below Quebeck &amp; advises
      that some able genl be sent to take the command, and recommends Lee as he expects a pretty
      severe attack in the spring - I wish he would stay himself as I know no person of more
      prudence &amp; conduct in our service, but I believe [he finds] that the provision made for a
      second in command, will not support one at the head of an army. He says nothing of this to me
      but express a warm desire to return to his farm &amp; mill . . . </P>
   <P>P: S: I just hear doubtful whether Carleton has escaped his vessels have made too fruitless

   <P>I arriv'd here last Saturday morning [November 25] and immediately made inquiry whether Colo
      Read had done any thing in the buissness with which he was charg'd - I found his Stay had been
      short during which time the Committee that sit during the recess of [Provincial] Congress
      could not be gotten together so that he went away without being able to forward the matter-The
      Committee met Yesterday and after having consider'd your Excellency's letter to them Colo
      McDougal waited upon me &amp; gave such reasons for not complying with the requisition for the
      heavy Cannon as would not be prudent to put on paper, he has promis'd me that he will use his
      utmost influence in the Congress which meets tomorrow, &amp; has no doubt of Success that 12
      exceeding good iron 4 pounders with a Quantity of Shells &amp; Shot shall be directly sent to
      Camp &amp; also he has promis'd the Loan of 2 fine brass six pounders cast in a foundery in
      this City - they have finish'd six - I very sincerely wish your Excellency had been acquainted
      with this Circumstance &amp; charg'd me with a commission to have had a number cast for the
      Camp-they turn out cheaper than the ones imported from Engld these cost 3/9: N Y Currency p lb
      - the English 2/6 sterg p lb - they weigh About 600 lb apeice.</P>
   <P>If sir you should think proper to have some done &amp; will give Orders to <name>Colo McDougal</name> or
      some other Gentleman of this City - the founder will execute one in two days after he shall
      receive the orders - and so any number in proportion - he also can cast brass Mortars - Colo
      McDougal has promis'd me that those articles shall be forwarded to the Camp with the utmost
      expedition - You will please sir to give Orders to Col [William] Burbeck to get light field
      Carriages &amp; appurtanances made for these Guns </P>
   <P>I shall set out by land tomorrow morning for Ticonderoga &amp; proceed with the utmost

      Warren, dated November 14-16. This letter, posted at Watertown, should have been received by
      Adams in Philadelphia ten days later. Adams probably began his list about November 5, the day
      he wrote to Warren and <name>Elbridge Gerry</name>, asking that they suggest names.</P>
   <P>3. <name>Charles Alexander</name>'s appearing twice would indicate that Adams added names without checking

      business as you will see by the inclosed Copy of instructions which I have given him - it
      would give me much Satisfaction, that this Gentleman or any other whom you may think

      8th instant I have expressed myself fully on this Subject, which I beg Leave to recommend to
      your immediate Attention, as the formation of that Corps will be at a Stand, untill I Am

      formation of the two Battallions of Marines, on the plan resolved on in Congress, as it can
      make no difference, I propose to proceed on the new arrangement of the Army and when
      Completed, enquire out such Officers &amp; Men as are best qualifyed for that service, and
      endeavour to form these two Battallions out of the Whole, this appears to me the best Method

   <P>[November 28] 2</P>
   <P>We were very fortunate in making the land, which was just at break of day; being in the middle
      of the Bay, we fell in with the Mercury man of war who (with a fleet of ships from New
      Portsmouth, which place they burnt) who convoyed us safe into Boston.3 The Bay at present is
      very unsafe for vessels unarmed, as it swarms with privateers, and a great number of whale
      boats, each carrying from ten to twenty men; these boats take the opportunity of putting out
      in moderate weather to intercept the vessels bound to Boston, and as we have no King's ships
      in any of the Ports but Boston, they do just as they please, and can always make a Port on one
      side or other of the Bay; they were so daring few days ago, as to board a brig off the
      Light-house, from Liverpool, which was at anchor; as they came on board on one side, the crew
      left it on the other; in the mean time an armed transport slipped her cables and run down to
      her assistance; when the Provincials saw the transport coming down, they left the brig, but
      endeavoured to set her on fire, by leaving some lighted coals on the cabin floor. 4 </P>

   <P>[Boston] 28 [November]</P>
   <P>By another Dispatch from Mr Arbuthnot dated the 17th instant the Admiral was informed that the
      Savage had Sailed with the Transport from Newfoundland, but that they had parted the third day
      after in a Gale of Wind: That they were putting the Yard in a State of Defence with the utmost
      Diligence under the Direction of Captain [William] Spry of the Engineers, by order of the
      General, as the Commissioner was informed: That there had been a great Neglect in providing
      Ordance Stores for supplying the Ships at Halifax, for that they were actually without Match,
      Cordage, Plank and Junk, for which Articles they constantly applied to the Navy Yard; and that
      the Commissioners of the sick and hurt allowed to the Surgeon of the Hospital there only
      fifteen pence a Man a day, for food, lodging, nursing, firing, and all the incidents relating
      to Boarding, Eight Shillings and Sixpence for every Patient, and Ten Shillings for burying the
      deceased, out of which the Clergyman demanded a Crown for his Fee. The Commissioner complained
      of the then Surgeons neglect of the sick, by n'ot allowing firing nor visiting properly, nor
      administring Medicines; that since he had written the above Mr Greaves the then Surgeon of the
      Hospital had given up and he had thereupon ordered 1 Mr Phillips to act, who was well known to
      the Surgeon of the Hospital at Boston; and the Commissioner hoped the Admiral would confirm
      him in the Office. Mr Arbuthnot added that he should only caulk the Savage and not clean her
      untill the Spring, as she was not fit for those Seas in the Winter. </P>
   <P>Captain Vandeput by a Letter dated Novr 1st (which came Yesterday) informed the Admiral that a
      Transport with two Land Officers on board had been cast away in Barn gut [Barnegut], the
      Vessel bulged to Pieces and the Officers carried Prisoners to Philadelphia, but that the
      People were not molested; that by their reckoning the Ship was 50 Leagues from the Land when
      she struck: 2 That Governor Tryon had hired a Ship for his habitation, that it was certain the
      Attempt of the Rebels against <name>St Johns</name> had failed, where General Carleton was daily expected
      with a Body of Canadians of whom he had raised Thirty Companies: That <name>Ethan Allen</name>, the Man who

   <P>From a Letter brought me by Lieut. Forrest on Sunday Evening [November 26] from your Office, I
      find the Sloop laden with Wood and Bark I seized off Piscatagua was retaken by the Rebels.2 I
      have by this means lost a Mate, Midshipman, three Seamen and two Marines, whom I put in her to
      navaigate and secure her Safety to Boston. A Man belonging to the Canceaux being a Pilot I put
      in to act in that Station, so that he is likewise taken with the rest of the People. These
      seven men with five short of Complement before, and the men now sent to the Hospital, four of
      whom are invalids and totally unfit for Service from old Age and other Infirmities and who
      have been a Burthen on the Ship for some time past, render the effective Men now on board very
      short indeed. </P>
   <P>I have swept the Ship this Morning and find the false Keel broke away from the aft side of the
      Mainmast to the fore part of the Stern Post, from our striking on the Rocks off Piscatagua;
      what damage we may have received from running on the Centurion Rock, the Night we came in, we
      cannot get at, as she hung entirely on the Bulge and slewed round on the Rock as the Flood
      tide made before we got off. Both these Accidents have been entirely through the Blunders of
      the Pilot. </P>

   <P>This morning, Tuesday the 28th [November], we got under way at dawn and put to sea with a
      west-north-west wind. We were convinced that we would see again the same vessels of our mortal
      enemy. During the day our ship was windbound and we made very little way, about 3 leagues.
      Seeing the coming of a very bad night we had to return to the entrance of the harbor. On our
      way back we found a small submerged boat that was empty. We took it and we assumed that it
      belonged to the warship that had exploded at sea from her powder-magazine according to the
      report made by the captain of the prize that we had captured last Monday. The night was very
      bad. Strong winds, rain and snow. </P>

   <P>My Dear General</P>
   <P>The Evening before General Montgomery landed on the Island of Montreal, Mr Carlton embarked
      his Garrison on Board of some Vessels and small Craft, And made two Attempts to pass our
      Batteries near the Mouth of Sorrel, but was drove back by Colo: Easton, who has behaved with
      Bravery &amp; much Alertness; On the 19th Mr Carlton disguised En Canadien &amp; accompanied
      by six Peasants, found Means to make his Escape, Brigadier General Prescott surrendered next
      Day by Capitulation. What Terms General Montgomery has given him, I do not know as he was so
      hurryed in preparing to move immediately to Quebec, that he could not find Time to send them.
      - Prescott &amp; the Officers arrived here at four to Day. I have just recd a Return of the
      Officers, Men, Vessels&amp; stores taken, which I do Myself the Honor to inclose. </P>
   <P>Your Excellency's Favor of the 16th November I received two Days ago. I believe some Cannon
      &amp; Mortars may be spared, but none Except what I have sent across <name>Lake George</name>, can be got
      down, until that or this Lake Freezes over. I have a very fine thirteen Inch Morter here, and
      I will make a Push to get her over the Lake. But where will You get Shells, we have none
      here?</P>
   <P>Mr [Robert R.] Livingston, Mr [John] Langdon &amp; Mr [Robert Treat] Paine arrived here at
      seven this Evening, The Season was so far advanced that I could not wait the Orders of
      Congress upon sundry Matters, which appeared to me absolutely necessary to be carried into
      immediate Execution. I am however, happy to find, that Every Measure I have pursued,
      corresponds with the Instructions given to the Committee.- </P>
   <P>I am informed that Prescott has used poor Walker &amp; Allen with a shamefull Brutality. Of
      this I shall acquaint Governor Trumbull, to whose Colony I shall send him.- </P>

   <P>[Ticonderoga] 28th [November]</P>
   <P>At four this Afternoon I was agreeably surprized with the Sight of Brig: Gen: Prescott &amp;
      the Officers taken with him from on Board the Vessels, lnclose You the several Returns 2 sent
      me by General Montgomery, who was so hurryed with his Preparations for descending to Quebec,
      that he could not find Time to send me the Terms which he gave Prescott.-</P>
   <P>I am happy to learn by the Gentlemen of the Committee 3 who arrived here at seven this Evening
      that Congress has Ordered the Prisoners to Pensylvania, as those still here and on their Way
      from Montreal will not be able to go down Hudson's River in Vessels, I propose sending them to
      Ulster County for the present as the Expence of Wheel Carriages runs very high And that they
      may be moved thence in Sleds at a much Cheaper Rate as soon as we have a Fall of Snow.-</P>
   <P>General Carlton stole from on Board the Vessels with six Canadians &amp; dressed like one of
      them, in this Disguise he Hopes to get into Quebec, But if he does the Weather has been so
      severe That I trust he will not be able to leave It. And then he must fall into our Hands, In
      the Course of this Winter, if not immediately.</P>
   <P>I find that it is the Intention of the New York Congress that the Troops raised in that Colony
      shou[ld] pay for their Under Clothes that were given them I cannot learn that the Troops
      expected to have any Thing stopped out of their Wages on that Account, [The] greatest Part of
      them are now in Canada, &amp; I fear that few of them will remain in the Service, if that
      should be the case, - I could wish therefore for the immediate Determination of Congress on
      this Head. I am Sir [&amp;c.] </P>

   <Title>JOURNAL OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS 1</Title>
   <P>[Philadelphia] Tuesday, November 28, 1775</P>
   <P>The Congress resumed the consideration of the rules for the regulation of the Navy of the
      United Colonies, and the same being debated by paragraphs, were agreed to as follows: </P>
   <P>Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies </P>
   <P>The Commanders of all ships and vessels belonging to the thirteen United Colonies, are
      strictly required to shew in themselves a good example of honor and virtue to their officers
      and men, and to be very vigilant in inspecting the behaviour of all such as are under them,
      and to discountenance and suppress all dissolute, immoral, and disorderly practices, and also
      such as are contrary to the rules of discipline and obedience, and to correct those who are
      guilty of the same, according to the usage of the sea. </P>
   <P>The Commanders of the ships of the thirteen United Colonies, are to take care that divine
      service be performed twice a day on board, and a sermon preached on Sundays, unless bad
      Weather or other extraordinary accidents prevent it. </P>
   <P>If any shall be heard to swear, curse, or blaspheme the name of God, the Commander is strictly
      enjoined to punish them for every offence, by causing them to wear a wooden collar, or some
      other shameful badge of distinction, for so long time as he shall judge proper. If he be a
      commissioned officer, he shall forfeit one shilling for each offence, and a warrant or
      inferior officer six pence. He who is guilty of drunkenness, if a seaman, shall be put in
      irons until he is sober, but if an officer, he shall forfeit two days' pay. </P>
   <P>No Commander shall inflict any punishment upon a seaman beyond twelve lashes upon his bare
      back, with a cat of nine tails; if the fault shall deserve a greater punishment, he is to
      apply to the Commander in chief of the Navy, in order to the trying of him by a court martial,
      and in the mean time, he may put him under confinement. </P>
   <P>The Commander is never by his own authority to discharge a commission or warrant officer, nor
      to punish or strike him, but he may suspend or confine them, and when he comes in the way of a
      Commander in Chief, apply to him for holding a court martial. </P>
   <P>The Officer who commands by accident of the Captain's or commander's absence (unless he be
      absent for a time by leave) shall not order any correction, but confinement, and upon the
      captain's return on board, he shall then give an account of his reasons for so doing.</P>
   <P>The Captain is to cause the articles of war to be hung up in some public places of the ship,
      and read to the ship's company once a month.</P>
   <P>Whenever a Captain shall inlist a seaman, he shall take care to enter on his books the time
      and terms of his entering, in order of his being justly paid. </P>
   <P>The Captain shall, before he sails, make return to, and leave with the Congress, or such
      person or persons as the Congress shall appoint for that purpose, a compleat list of all his
      officers and men, with the time and terms of their entering; and during his cruize shall keep
      a true account of the desertion or death of any of them, and of the entering of others, and
      after his cruize, and before any of them are paid off, he shall make return of a compleat list
      of the same, including those who shall remain on board his ship. </P>
   <P>The men shall, at their request, be furnished with slops that are necessary by the Captain or
      purser, who shall keep an account of the same, and the Captain, in his return in the last
      mentioned article directed to be made, shall mention the amount delivered to each man, in
      order to its being stopped out of his pay. </P>
   <P>As to the term &quot;inferior Officer,&quot; the Captain is to take notice that the same does
      not include any commission or any warrant officer, except the second master, surgeon's mate,
      cook, armourer, gun-smith, master at arms, and sail maker. </P>
   <P>The Captain is to take care when any inferior officers or volunteer seamen are turned over
      into the ship under his command from any other ship, not to rate them-on the ship's books in a
      worse quality, or lower degree or station, than they served in the ship they were removed
      from; and for his guidance he is to demand from the commander of the ship from which they are
      turned over, a list under his hand, of their names and qualities. </P>
   <P>Any officer, seamen, or others, intitled to wages or prize money, may have the same paid to
      his assignee, provided the assignment be attested by the Captain or Commander, the master or
      purser of the ship, or a chief magistrate of some county or corporation. </P>
   <P>The Captain is to discourage the seamen of his ship from selling any part of their wages or
      shares, and never to attest the letter of attorney of any seaman, until he is fully satisfied
      that the same is not granted in consideration of money given for the purchase of his wages or
      shares. </P>
   <P>When any inferior officer or seaman dies, the Captain is forthwith to make out a ticket for
      the time of his service, and send the same by the first safe conveyance to the Congress, or
      agents by them for that purpose appointed, in order to the wages being forthwith paid to the
      executors or administrators of the deceased. </P>
   <P>A convenient place shall be set apart for sick or hurt men, to which they are to be removed,
      with their hammocks and bedding, when the surgeon shall advise the same to be necessary, and
      some of the crew shall be appointed to attend and serve them, and to keep the place clean. </P>
   <P>The cooper shall make buckets with covers and cradles, if necessary, for their use. </P>
   <P>All ships furnished with fishing tackle, being in such places where fish is to be had, the
      Captain is to employ some of the company in fishing; the fish to be distributed daily to such
      persons as are sick or upon recovery, provided the surgeon recommend it, and the surplus, by
      turns amongst the messes of the officers and seamen, without favour or partiality and gratis,
      without any deduction of their allowance of provisions on that account. </P>
   <P>It is left to the discretion of Commanders of squadrons, to shorten the allowance of
      provisions according to the exigence of the service, taking care that the men be punctually
      paid for the same. </P>
   <P>The like power is given to Captains of single ships in cases of absolute necessity.</P>
   <P>If there shall be a want of pork, the Captain is to order three pounds of beef to be issued to
      the men, in lieu of two pounds of pork. </P>
   <P>One day in every week shall be issued out a proportion of flour and suet, in lieu of beef, for
      the seamen, but this is not to extend beyond four months' victualling at one time, nor shall
      the purser receive any allowance for flour or suet kept longer on board than that time, and
      there shall be supplied, once a year, a proportion of canvass for pudding-bags, after the rate
      of one ell for every sixteen men. </P>
   <P>If any ships of the thirteen United Colonies, shall happen to come into port in want of
      provisions, the warrant of a Commander in chief shall be sufficient to the Agent or other
      instrument of the victualling, to supply the quantity wanted, and in urgent cases where delay
      may be hurtful, the warrant of the Captain of the ship shall be of equal effect. </P>
   <P>The Captain is frequently to order the proper officers to inspect into the condition of the
      provisions, and if the bread proves damp, to have it aired upon the quarter deck or poop, and
      also examine the flesh casks, and if any of the pickle be leaked out, to have new made and put
      in, and the casks made tight and secure. </P>
   <P>The Captain or purser shall secure the cloaths, bedding, and other things of such persons as
      shall die or be killed, to be delivered to their executors or administrators. </P>
   <P>All papers, charter parties, bills of lading, passports, and other writings whatsoever, found
      on board any ship or ships, which shall be taken, shall be carefully preserved, and the
      originals sent to the court of Justice for maritime affairs, appointed or to be appointed by
      the legislatures in the respective colonies, for judging concerning such prize or prizes; and
      if any person or persons shall wilfully or negligently destroy or suffer to be destroyed, any
      such paper or papers, he or they so. offending, shall forfeit their share of such prize or
      prizes, and suffer such other punishment, as they shall be judged by a court-martial to
      deserve. </P>
   <P>If any person or persons shall embezzle, steal, or take away any cables, anchors, sails, or
      any of the ship's furniture, or any of the powder, arms, ammunition, or provisions of any ship
      belonging to the thirteen United Colonies, he or they shall suffer such punishment as a
      court-martial shall order. </P>
   <P>When in sight of a ship or ships of the enemy, and at such other times as may appear to make
      it necessary to prepare for an engagement, the Captain shall order all things in his ship in a
      proper posture for fight, and shall, in his own person, and according to his duty, heart on
      and encourage the inferior officers and men to fight courageously, and not to behave
      themselves faintly or cry for quarters, on pain of such punishment as the offence shall appear
      to deserve for his neglect. </P>
   <P>Any Captain or other officer, mariner, or others, who shall basely desert their duty or
      station in the ship, and run away while the enemy is in sight, or, in time of action, or shall
      entice others to do so, shall suffer death, or such other punishment as a court-martial shall
      inflict. </P>
   <P>Any officer, seaman, or marine, who shall begin, excite, cause, or join in any mutiny or
      sedition in the ship to which he belongs, on any pretence whatsoever, shall suffer death, or
      such other punishment as a court-martial shall direct. Any person in or belonging to the ship,
      who shall utter any words of sedition and mutiny, or endeavour to make any mutinous assemblies
      on any pretence whatsoever, shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial shall inflict. </P>
   <P>None shall presume to quarrel with or strike his superior officer, on pain of such punishment
      as a court-martial shall order to be inflicted: </P>
   <P>If any person shall apprehend he has just cause of complaint, he shall quietly and decently
      make the same known to his superior officer, or to the captain, as the case may require, who
      will take care that justice be done him. </P>
   <P>There shall be no quarrelling or fighting between shipmates on board any ship belonging to the
      thirteen United Colonies, nor shall there be used any reproachful or provoking speeches,
      tending to make quarrels and disturbance, on pain of imprisonment, and such other punishment,
      as a court-martial shall think proper to inflict. </P>
   <P>If any person shall sleep upon his watch, or negligently perform the duty which shall be
      enjoined him to do, or forsake his station, he shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial
      shall judge proper to inflict, according to the nature of his offence. </P>
   <P>All murder shall be punished with death. </P>
   <P>All robbery and theft shall be punished at the discretion of a court martial. </P>
   <P>Any master at arms who shall refuse to receive such prisoner or prisoners, as shall be
      committed to his charge, or having received them, shall suffer him or them to escape, or
      dismiss them without orders for so doing, shall suffer in his or their stead, as a
      court-martial shall order and direct. </P>
   <P>The Captain, officers, and others, shali'use their utmost endeavours to detect, apprehend, and
      bring to punishment, all offenders, and shall at all times readily assist the officers
      appointed for that purpose in the discharge of their duty, on pain of being proceeded against,
      and punished by a court-martial at discretion. </P>
   <P>All other faults, disorders, and misdemeanors, which shall be committed on board any ship
      belonging to the thirteen United Colonies, and which are not herein mentioned, shall be
      punished according to the laws and customs in such cases at sea. </P>
   <P>A court-martial shall consist of at least three Captains and three first lieutenants, with
      three Captains and three first lieutenants of Marines, if there shall be so many of the
      Marines then present, and the eldest Captain shall preside. </P>
   <P>All sea officers of the same denomination shall take rank of the officers of the marmes. </P>
   <P>Every Member of a court-martial shall take the following oath, viz: </P>
   <P>&quot;You <gap/> swear that you will well and truly try, and impartially determine the cause
      of the prisoner now to be tried, according to the rules of the Navy of the United Colonies. So
      help you God:&quot; which oath shall be administered by the president to the other members,
      and the president shall himself be sworn by th~ officer in said court next in rank. </P>
   <P>All witnesses, before they may be admitted to give evidence, shall take the following
      oath:</P>
   <P>&quot;You swear the evidence you shall give, in the cause now in hearing, shall be the truth,
      the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help you God.&quot; </P>
   <P>The sentence of a court-martial for any capital offence, shall not be put in execution, until
      it be confirmed by the Commander in chief of the fleet; and it shall be the duty of the
      president of every court-martial, to transmit to the Commander in chief of the fleet, every
      sentence which shall be given, with a summary of the evidence and proceedings thereon, by the
      first opportunity. </P>
   <P>The Commander in chief of the fleet, for the time being, shall have power to pardon and remit
      any sentence of death, that shall be given in consequence of any of the afore mentioned
      Articles. </P>
   <P>There shall be allowed to each man serving on board the ships in the service of the thirteen
      United Colonies, a daily proportion of provisions, according as is expres.sed in the following

   <Title>AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF <name>JOHN ADAMS</name> 1</Title>
   <P>On Tuesday November 28. 1775. The Congress resumed the Consideration of the Rules and Orders
      for the Navy of the United Colonies, and the same being debated by Paragraphs were agreed to .
      . . They were drawn up in the Marine Committee and by my hand, but examined, discussed, and
      corrected by the Committee. In this place I will take the Opportunity to observe, that the
      pleasantest part of my Labours for the four Years I spent in Congress from 1774 to 1778
      [i.e.1777] was in this naval Committee. Mr. Lee, Mr. Gadsden, were sensible Men, and very
      chearful; But Governor Hopkins of Rhode Island, above seventy Years of Age kept us all alive.
      Upon Business his Experience and Judgment were very Usefull. But when the Business of the
      Evening was over, he kept Us in Conversation till Eleven and sometimes twelve OClock. His
      Custom was to drink nothing all day nor till Eight OClock, in the Evening, and then his
      Beveredge was Jamaica Spirit and Water. It gave him Wit, Humour, Anecdotes, Science and
      Learning. He had read Greek, Roman and British History: and was familiar with English Poetry
      particularly Pope, Tompson [Thomson] and Milton. And the flow of his Soul made all his reading
      our own, and seemed to bring to recollection in all of Us all We had ever read. I could
      neither eat nor drink in those days. The other Gentlemen were very temperate. Hopkins never
      drank to excess, but all he drank was immediately not only converted into Wit, Sense.
      Knowledge and good humour, but inspired Us all with similar qualities. </P>

      station'd at Chester &amp; Philada, to bring up from thence any Vessel bound up, &amp; Carry

      of the new Commission'd Pilots would go on board. Some of the Pilots who have lately come up,
      say they have never had any Notice of the above Regulation. If this is the Case, we suppose
      Mrs. Hidgecock has Neglected to give you the letter. We must now desire you will immediately

   <P>Our River is well secured by a Cheval de Frise sunk about eight Miles below our Town, with a
      small Aperature for our own Vessels to pass thro', which they generally can do with the
      Assistance of a good Pilot who knows the Situation of this Machiny or Instrument of Defence;
      altho' we have already lost two small Vessels in attempting to pass it, even with good Pilots
      on Board. None of the Lewistown Pilots are suffered to come up higher than Chester, nor to go
      on board of any Vessel at Lewis Town without Application first made to the Committee there:
      There are other Pilots stationed at Chester to bring up the Vessels thro the Cheval d~ Frise.
      And we have 13 Gondaloes with a large Cannon of 24 to 4~ Prs with Men, on board to guard this
      Pass, so that it will be very difficult for a Man of War to come up to Town.- </P>

      Exportation of the same from some of the Ports in Great Britain - Mr <name>Martin Comptroller</name> of the

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Philadelphia Nov. 29. 1775.</P>
   <P>I have it in my power to acquaint you that the successes of our arms have corresponded with
      the justice of our cause. Chambly and <name>St. John</name>'s have been taken some weeks ago, and in them
      the whole regular army in Canada except about 40. or 50. men. This day we receive certain
      intelligence that our General Montgomery is received into Montreal: and expect every hour to
      be informed that Quebec has opened it's arms to Colo. Arnold who with 1100 men was sent from
      Boston up the Kennebec and down the Chaudiere river to that place. He expected to be there
      early this month. Montreal acceded to us on the 13th. and Carleton set out with the shattered
      remain[s] of his little army for Quebec where we hope he will be taken up by Arnold. In a
      short time we have reason to hope the delegates of Canada wil'ljoin us in Congress and
      complete the American Union as far as we wish to have it completed. We hear that one of the
      British transports is arrived at Boston, the rest are beating off the coast in very bad
      weather. You will have heard before this reaches you that Ld. Dunmore has commenced
      hostilities in Virginia. That people bore with every thing till he attempted to bum the town
      of Hampton. They opposed and repelled him with considerable loss on his side and none on ours.
      It has raised our country into perfect phrensy. It is an immense misfortune to the whole
      empire to have a king of such a disposition at such a time. We are told and every thing proves
      it true that he is the bitterest enemy we have. His minister is able, and that satisfies me
      that ignorance or wickedness somewhere controuls him. In an earlier part of this contest our
      petitions told him that from our king there\was but one appeal. The admonition was despised
      and that appeal forced on us. To undo his empire he has but one truth more to learn, that
      after colonies have drawn the sword there is but one s~&quot;-more they can take. That step is
      now pressed upon us by the measures adopted as if they were afraid we would not take it.
      Beleive me Dear Sir there is not i~the British empire a man who more cordially_ loves a Union
      with Gr. Britain thin~ do. But by the god that made me I will cease to exist before I yeild to
      a connection on such terms as the British parliament propose and in this I think I
      speak&quot;'the sentiments of America. We want neither inducement nor power to declare and
      assert a separation. It is will alone which is wanting and that is growing apace under the
      fostering hand of our king. One bloody campaign will probably decide everlastingly our future
      course; I am sorry to find a bloody campaign is decided on. If our winds and waters should not
      combine to rescue their shores from slavery, and General Howe's reinforcement should arrive in
      safety we have hopes he will be inspirited to come out of Boston and take another drubbing:
      and we must drub you soundly before the sceptered tyrant will know we are not mere brutes, to
      crouch under his hand and kiss the rod with which he deigns to scourge us. </P>

   <P>I have a very singular pleasure in informing you that by express last night from <name>Cape Ann</name>, I
      received the glad tidings of the capture of the Nancy storeship from London, by Capt. Manley,
      contents asper the enclosed copy, (taken by Mr. Pierce, to save me, you must know, the trouble
      of enumeration.) He unluckily miss'd the greatest prize in the world; their whole ordinance,
      the ship containing it being just ahead, but he could not have got both; and we must be
      thankful, as I truly am, for this instance of Divine favour; for nothing surely ever came more
      apropos; that no part of it may slip through my fingers, (for I have no doubt as this capture
      was made in sight of the other vessel, of there being some bold push to recover it) I
      instantly upon receiving the account, ordered four companies down to protect the stores; teams
      to be impress'd, to remove them without delay; and Col. Glover to assemble the minute men in
      the neighbourhood of <name>Cape Ann</name>, to secure the removal to places of safety. </P>

   <P>[November 30]</P>
   <P>On my arrival here the Admiral pressed all our hands; they served all the transports in the
      same manner. As to the situation of Boston, it is almost surrounded by the Americans, and
      their works appear to be very strong for seven miles round. The troops in Boston are well
      supplied with salt provisions, flour, pease, &amp;c. but the inhabitants fare badly. The
      soldiers seem to be in good spirits, but the heads of the army and navy are but upon
      indifferent terms; when that is the case, especially at a critical juncture, God only knows
      what will be the end of it. </P>

   <P>Sir </P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 30 Novr 1775</P>
   <P>By Captain Tollemache, who sailed from hence in his Majesty's <name>Sloop Scorpion</name> the Iatter end of
      August, I sent Orders to Captain Thornborough of the Tamer to repair immediately to North
      Carolina, and having assisted Captain [Francis] Parry of the Cruizer to dismantle Fort
      Johnston and put the Ordnance Stores on board a Transport, which Captain Tollemache carried
      with him for that purpose, to come to Boston and leave Captain Tollemache at Cape Fear. But,
      as I have not since heard from either of the Captains, I am apprehensive the Scorpion thro'
      some Accident is not arrived at Carolina. I therefore suppose that agreeably totheir Lordships
      Order to you of the 31st of August 1775 (a Copy of which I have received.) you have sent the
      Tamer to Savannah in Georgia, one of the Sloops that was at Virginia to <name>Charles Town</name>, and that
      this wiH find you at Virginia, where I think it would be most proper for you to remain.
      However if through any accident no senior Officer to yourself arrives at Virginia, I desire
      the Tamer and Cruizer may be sent to Boston as soon in the Spring as the Weather will admit. I
      have ordered Captain Stanhope to go to Savannah, lest no Sloop should be there, but upon his
      Arrival you will dispose of him as you judge best for the Service, after his Dispatches are
      delivered. And I recommend it to your Consideration whether it would not be right to let two
      Sloops be at <name>Charles Town</name>, for I think one there is not sufficient. I am &amp;c</P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Preston, Boston 30 Novr 1775, </P>
   <P>Upon the Arrival of the Phoenix in Nantasket Road the 9th instant I directed Captain Parker to
      remain there to repair the damage he had suffered on his passage from England, and to compleat
      his Provisions to six Months, in Order to releive the Asia at New York. The Phoenix was ready
      the 20th but contrary Winds kept her in the Road until the 27th when she sailed in fine
      settled Weather. </P>
   <P>By the Viper who sailed the 17th for New York I apprized Captain Vandeput that the Phoenix was
      coming to relieve the Asia, and directed him to commit to Writing such Intelligence as he had
      collected of the operations and designs of the Rebels, the Navigation of the Rivers
      particularly Hudsons River, and any other information necessary to leave with his Successor,
      and to retain as many good Pilots as could be procured; so that I hope the Asia will sail for
      England in a very few days after the Arrival of the Phoenix. Captain Parker has Orders to take
      the Asia's private Marines on board the Phoenix, until they can be sent to Boston and join the
      Battalions on shore. </P>
   <P>I have had so many contradictory Accounts of the probability of a large Ship lying during the
      Winter in the River without going along side a Wharf that I have left it to Captain Parker's
      discretion (who has wintered there) where to place his Ship while the Ice runs, but I have
      ordered him to anchor before the City whenever the River is clear; and having six months
      Provisions on board and the Viper with him, whatever tum things m.i.y take in the City, before
      the Navigation to it is open, I think Captain Parker cannot be distressed. </P>
   <P>In one of my former Letters mention is made of my intent[ion] to send the Nautilus with Lord
      Dartmouths Dispatches for the Governors of his Majesty's Cdlonies to the Southward, and that I
      had given Captain Collim Leave to be on shore for the Recovery of his Health while the Sloop
      was fitting. About the 16th she was ready, but Captain Collins, unable to take upon himself
      the Command, begged my further Indulgence of Leave, and finding him from the Surgeon's Report
      to be utterly incapable of doing his Duty, I granted him leave to remain on Shore, and gave an
      Order to Lieut. <name>John Graves</name> of the Preston to command the Nautilus, and sent him to cruize in
      Boston Bay. I also directed Captain Stanhope of his Majesty's <name>Sloop Raven</name> to compleat his
      provisions immediately to six months in order to .proceed with the Dispatches instead of the
      Nautilus; which being done Captain Stanhope sailed this day. I inclose Copies of Captain
      Collins's Letters and the Surgeon's Report. </P>
   <P>Captain Stanhope is to touch at Newcastle on the Delaware, at Virginia, North Carolina, and at
      Savannah in Georgia, where I have directed him to remain until farther Order, expecting the
      Tamer and Cruizer to be on their passage to Boston: But lest that should not be the Case,
      through any unforseen Accident, I have given directions to Captain Bellew of his Majesty's
      Ship Liverpool, in a Letter dated this day, a Copy of which is inclosed that you may be
      thoroughly informed what force we have at present to the Southward of Philadelphia. </P>
   <P>The Tartar arrived the 24th from the Bay of Fundy with part of her Convoy of Transports laden
      with Forage, one of which, the Jupiter, full of Hay commanded by Lieutenant Dickenson the
      Agent, was set on fire by Lightning in Boston Bay on the 29th instant and entirely consumed;
      His Majesty's Ship Mercury happened fortunately to be near and saved all the Peop'le except
      Col. Day a Gentleman of <name>Nova Scotia</name>, and a firm Friend to Government, who was drowned </P>
   <P>The 26 the Cerberus arrived from a Cruize having suffered greatly by the turbulent Weather she
      met with. Captain Symons acquaints me he ran ashore on the Whales Back near Piscatagua, and,
      since he came in, got upon the Centurion Rock in this Harbour, so that I shall be obliged to
      have the Cerberus's bottom looked at before she can proceed to Sea again. This I purpose doing
      here and that the Ships shall hawl alongside, and put out their Guns, Cables and heavy Stores
      on Hancocks Wharf. The Falcon hath been already graved, and I intend to clean some of the
      Frigates, 20 Gun Ships and Sloops, whose Bottoms do not want caulking, that they may be ready
      for Service early in the Spring. </P>
   <P>As the Master of his Majesty's Ship Preston, whom I ordered to act as Master Attendant at
      Halifax, is superseded and returned to his Ship, I have given him an Order to act as Master
      Attendant at Boston with the same allowance of five Shillings sterling p Day as he had at
      Halifax; This Officer is and will be much wanted here and I hope their Lordships will approve
      my appointing Mr Holman, who is an exceeding good Man and well qualified for the Office; And,
      having a Naval Officer also, the business of the Port will now be carried on I hope with
      nearly the same regularity and Dispatch used in the Kings Yards at home. </P>
   <P>The Lively being compleated with Stores and Provisions is gone to Nantasket, and I have
      ordered the Cerberus to come up. </P>
   <P>General Howe has fortified the Light house at the entrance of Boston Harbour, and a light is
      now shewn as before. While the Workmen were employed, sometimes an armed Transport and
      sometimes a Man of War received them on board at Night and protected them until the Building
      was capable of being def ended by a Party of Soldiers stationed for that purpose. </P>
   <P>The <name>Nancy Brig</name> laden with Ordnance Stores; which came out under Convoy of the Phoenix, is not
      yet arrived although she has been near three weeks on the Coast, and has been successively
      under Convoy of the Cerberus and Mercury, but from Gales of Wind and thick Weather could not
      get in. </P>
   <P>His Majesty's <name>Ship Fowey</name> anchored at Nantasket from Halifax the 26th instant, and by my Order
      Captain Parker directed her immediately to cruize in the Bay; and she sailed again the 28th </P>
   <P>Being in daily expectation'of the Arrival of some of the Frigates, and knowing their
      Lordship's earnest desire to have the great Ships home, I have determined to let the Boyne
      return, and Captain Hartwell will accordingly sail the 4th of next month for Plymouth. He
      carries home all our Invalids, together with a Number of American Seamen, whom I have ordered
      to be borne on a supernumerary List for Wages and Victuals, and as I have directed Captain
      Hartwell to write to you concerning them upon his Arrival I hope their Lordships will be
      pleased to order them to be distributed, so as they may not serve in any Numbers together in
      America. I am &amp;c </P>

   <Title>&quot;EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM ONE OF THE FLEET AT BOSTON, DATED Nov. 30, 1775.&quot; 1 </Title>
   <P>Matters are carried on here with a very high hand on both sides; but before the ensuing spring
      is at an end, you will hear of a material alteration in the government of America. The
      Congress has published a declaration of war against the British parliament, and have issued
      commissions to privateers. They took a transport with arms within a mile of one of our ships
      at anchor; 2 indeed they are bold enough to dare and do any thing. It is a pity the parliament
      were in such a hurry to stigmatize them with cowardice before they were tried. However,
      whatever other vices they may have, cowardice is not one of them .... We are ordered to the
      southward, of which I am glad, for the cold is very severe and intense at this moment. The
      Nautilus has been severely cannonaded by the Provincial batteries at <name>Cape Ann</name>; like military
      Harlequins they attack us every where, God end this unnatural warfare. </P>

      they canot depend on Suplys from Great Brittain at this Season, &amp; more especialy as our
      Cruisers keep so good a look out for the Transports-</P>
   <P>Although Wallace has now at Newport 10 Sail of Armed Vessells, &amp; yesterday we are told 7
      Transports arrived there last Tuesday, (this last Accot doubtful as to Transports) yet I don't
      beleive Newport is the place of the Enemys destination, as that Island doth afford many
      Cattle, and not any Grain, and should the Town be sett on Fire by the American Troops, the
      Enemy would then have no Barracks-my Opinion is that New York is the best place on the
      Continent for their Rendenvous, for although New York should be reduced to Ashes, yet Long
      Island is at hand, &amp; wilt well suply them with Barracks, &amp; they will have the Range of
      that whole Island for the Winter, &amp; will get there a great quantity of Stock, &amp; plenty
      of Wheat; as by their Ships they will make it extreem dificult for the American Army to Annoy
      them on that Island, this Winter, nay it will be almost impossible. again they can be at New
      York, &amp; entrench around that City, &amp; prevent the Americans from Attacking them this
      Winter, as the Army at your Camp is so remote, and the Southern Troops distant also-nor would
      it do for an Army to Encamp near New York, where they could have nothing but their Tents to
      Cover them, &amp; no fire places the aproaching winter. </P>
   <P>I congratulate you on the good News from Mount Real, &amp; expect the same good Accot from
      Quebeck eny moment-three months since one of the Conecticut Newspapers predicted that General
      Carlton would be a Prisoner at Hartford, which Prophesy (I trust) will probably be soon
      fulfilled-thus I have thrown out my loose conjectures, merely to divert my old Friend. </P>
   <P>And now to come nearer home, tel1 you, I have finished the Fort at New London, &amp; all
      things ready [to] do what we can, when caled to it - finding it dificult to point large Cannon
      directly to an Object, I have projected a Sight to be fixed near the mouth of Our Cannon, that
      will enable us to take as compleat an Aim at an object as can be done with a musket, the model
      of which is beneath &amp; when you have examined whether it will answer my expectation or not,
      give your Opinion - It is made of 2 Inch Oake Plank &amp; feighd close down to the forend of
      the Cannon, &amp; an I[ron] sight put into it, so as that the botom of the sight, and top of
      <name>Britch of the Cannon</name>, having a streight line drawn from them, it will be paralel to the Chase
      of the Cannon, the sight to stand perpendicular over the Center of the Chase - the piece of
      Plank must be woolded round the Cannon in two places where it is notched, &amp; put a little
      hot Pitch or other Glutinous substance under the wood to prevent its moveing side ways, or /
      which is more certain bore a hole at each woolding Place, &amp; drill a hole into the Cannon ½
      Inch or more, &amp; put in each an Iron pin before woo [lding]. Y oul observe the model below
      stands off the Cannon, to give planer description, but it must be put firm on Cannon before
      woulded-thus hastily I have scratched out a model by which youl find what I intend-My Heaven
      best of Blessings rest upon the Army encamped [at] Cambridge &amp; on the General Officers in
      Special-</P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P><name>Philada Novr</name> 30th 1775.</P>
   <P>I am directed by the Congress to transmit you their Thanks for your great and signal Services
      in the Expedition committed to your Command against the British Troops in the Province of
      Canada. </P>
   <P>The Reduction of <name>St Johns</name> and Montreal they esteem of inexpressible Advantage to the united
      Colonies, and the most mortifying Contravention to the ministerial System of enslaving the
      extensive Territory of Canada. It cannot therefore fail of reflecting singular Lustre on the
      Character of a General so essentially instrumental in preserving that Liberty, by the
      Abolition of which, a corrupt Parliament intended to annihilate every Appearance of Freedom in
      America. Nor, are the Humanity and Politeness, with which you have treated those in your Power
      less illustrious Instances of Magnanimity, than the Valour, by which you reduced them to it.
      The Congress utterly abhorrent from every Species of Cruelty to Prisoners, and determined to
      adhere to this benevolent Maxim, till the Conduct of their Enemies renders a Deviation from it
      indispensible necessary, will ever applaud their Officers for beautifully blending the
      Christian with the Conqueror; and never, in endeavouring to acquire the Character of the Hero,
      to lose that of the Man.</P>
   <P>The Victories already gained in Canada afford us a happy Presage of die Smiles of Providence
      on the farther Designation of the Continental Arms in the North, and will in all Probability
      greatly facilitate the entire Reduction of the deluded Malignants in that Province to -
      Liberty. These, Sir, are Exp'loits so glorious in their Execution and so extensive in their
      Consequences, that the Mem ory of <name>Genl Montgomery</name>, will doubtless, be of equal Duration, with
      the Remembrance of the Benefits derived from his Command.</P>
   <P>At the same Time that the Congress rejoice with you in the Success of their Arms under your
      more immediate Direction, they cannot avoid expressing their Concern at the Intimation you
      give of your Intention to retire from the Service. They are sensible that the Loss of so brave
      and experienced an Officer will be universally regretted as a Misfortune to all America. But
      they still hope, that upon reconsidering the Matter, the same generous and patriotic Motives,
      which first induced you to take so capital a Part in opposing the unprovoked Hostilities of an
      unnatural Enemy, will prompt you to persevere in the Cause, and to continue gathering fresh
      Laurels, till you find our Oppressions reduced to Reason, and America restored to her
      constitutional Liberties. I am &amp;c </P>

      provided he woud go with him he shou'd have it very reasonable, upon which this Depont agreed
      to go with sundry others down as far as the mouth of Pocomoke river upon which the said Levin
      Townsend administred an Oath to him to keep the matter Secret, but not finding any Salt this
      Depont &amp; some others wanted to return, upon which the said Townsend confined them &amp;
      that the said <name>Levin Townsend</name> &amp; others went on shore where they kill'd a Beef whereupon
      they proceeded down to Norfolk &amp; upon their arival [at] Norfolk the said <name>Levin Townsend</name>

      said he wou'd rather choose to go Home again &amp; that said Townsand said you cannot return
      Home, for you will not be let return, you will be taken up &amp; further told this Depont that
      if this Depont did not go up to the Standad in Norfolk the Governor woud most certainly detain

      in the Tender afsd and that a certain <name>Edmond Scarborough</name> of Virginia was to go to Pocomoke
      with as an Assistant &amp; that the said <name>Levin Townsand</name> said that after he took a Cruize or
      two up the Bay in order to make some Prizes, he shou'd Lay his Vessell against the Cypresses
      in Pocomoke River and that he wou'd then seize the Committee of Worcester County whilst they

   <Title>LORD DUNMORE TO MAJOR GENERAL <name>WILLIAM HOWE</name> 1 </Title>
   <P>Dear General</P>
   <P>On board the Ship William off Norfolk in Virginia 30th Novr 1775 </P>
   <P>The report here is that General Gage is gone home, and that you are appointed to Succeed him,
      if so, from my heart I give you Joy, and am well persuaded you will soon evince to the World
      that you are well deserving the Honor conferred on you, by your Soverign; I must inform you
      that with our little Corps I think we have done wonders, We have taken and destroyed above
      four Score pieces of Ordnance, and by landing in different parts of the Country, we keep then
      in continual Hott Water, but as Captn Leslie tells me he means to write to you on this Subject
      I have no doubt he will give you particulars enough so shall say no more on that Subject. </P>
   <P>Amongst the Prisoners we have taken are <name>Oliver Porter</name>, and Dean two Natives of Boston, the
      former was taken as you see by His own deposition (No 1) bringing in Gun Powder to North
      Carolina, the latter was sent from Boston to inflame the minds of the People, in which he had
      been but too Successfull, he was taken from on board a Schooner going from this to the Western
      Islands to bring Powder to this Colony, and the others have carried Arms against His Majesty
      in this Province, I have sent them more with a view of intimidating others, than to punish
      them, as they expect here that so sure as they are sent to Boston they are to be hanged,
      [William] Robinson is a delegate of our Convention as you see by his deposition (No 2),
      [Thomas] Mathews was a Captain of their Minute men; perhaps they may be of use to you in
      exchanging them for good men. </P>
   <P>There is a vacancy in the 14th Regiment by the Death of <name>Captn Blacket</name>, I realy should not do
      them justice if I did not recommend it to you to let the promotion go in the Corps, which I
      hope you will do. </P>
   <P>The Sloop not sailing so soon as I expected,2 I have to inform you that on the 14th Ins[t] I
      had information that a party of about a hundred of the North Carolina Rebels had marched to
      the Assistance of those in this Colony, and were posted at a place Called the great Bridge, a
      very essential pass into this part of the Country, I accordingly embarked our little Corps of
      the 14th in Boats, in the Night with between Twenty and thirty Volunteers from Norfolk, we
      landed within four Miles of the Bridge, and arrived there a little after day light, but to our
      great mortification found the birds had flown the evening before; but hearing that a body of
      between two and three hundred of our Rebels were within a bout ten Miles of us, we determined
      to beat up their quarters, and accordingly proceeded about eight Miles when they fired on our
      advanced guard from the Wood, on which I immediately ordered our People to rush in upon them,
      and at the same time sent a part of the Regulars with the Volunteers to out flank them, the
      Enemy immediately fled on all quarters, and our People pursued them for a Mile or more, killed
      a few, drove others into a Creek where they were drowned, took nine prisoners among which is
      one of their Colonels, we had only one man wounded who is recovering. I cannot conclude
      without again informing you that my friends of the 14th both Officers and Soldiers have in
      this late as well as on all former occasions behaved with that good Conduct, and Spirit,
      becoming British Soldiers. Immediately on this I issued the inclosed Proclamation which has
      had a Wonderfull effect as there are not less than three thousand that have already taken and
      signed the inclosed Oath. The Negroes are flocking in also from all quarters which I hope will
      oblige the Rebels to disperse to take care of their families, and property, and had I but a
      few more men here I would March immediately to Williamsburg my former place of residence by
      which I should soon compell the whole Colony to Submit. </P>
   <P>We are in great want of small Arms, and if two or three light field pieces and their Carriages
      could be Spared they would be of great Service to us, also some Cartridge paper of which not a
      Sheet is to be got here, and all our Cartridges expended. </P>
   <P>Since the 28th of May last I have not received a Single line from any one in Administration,
      tho I have wrote Volumes to them in each of which I have prayed to be instructed but to no
      purpose, I am therefore determined to go on doing the best in my power for His Majesty's
      Service, I have accordingly ordered a Regiment (Called the Queens own Loyal Virginia Regiment)
      of 500 men to be raised immediately consisting of a Lieutenant Colonel commandent, a Major and
      Ten Companys each of which is to consist of one Captain, 2 Lieutenants one Ensign and 50
      Privates with none Commissionerd Officers in proportion; You may observe by my Proclamation
      that I offer freedom to the Slaves, (of all Rebels) that join me, in consequence of which
      there are between two and three hundred already come in and these I form into a Corps as fast
      as they come in giving them white Officers and Non Commissioned Officers in proportion, and
      from these two plans I make no doubt of geting men enough to reduce this Colony to a proper
      sense of their duty, but my next distress will be want of Arms Acoutrements and Money, all of
      which perhaps you may be able to releive me from, the latter I am sure you can as there are
      many Merchants here who are ready to supply me on my giving them bills on you which you will
      have to withdraw and give your own in their place. I hope this mode will be agreeable to you
      it is the same that General Gage proposed; I have now in order to carry on the Recruiting
      business victualing Cloathing &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c drawn on you for five thousand Pounds
      Sterling, and have appointed a pay Master who will keep exact accounts. I wish you would by
      the return of the Sloop inform me what bounty Money may be given to those who inlist. </P>
   <P>Having heard that a thousand chosen Men belonging to the Rebels, a great part of which were
      Rifle men, were on their March to attack us here so to cut off our provisions, I determined to
      take possession of the pass at the great Bridge which Secures us the greatest part of two
      Counties to supply us with provisions. I accordingly ordered a Stockade Fort to be erected
      there, which was done in a few days, and I put an Officer and Twenty five men to Garrison it,
      with some Volunteers and Negroes, who have defended it against all the efforts of the Rebels
      for these eight days past, we have killed Several of their Men, and I make no doubt we shall
      now be able to maintain our ground there, but should we be obliged to abandon it, we have
      thrown up an Entrenchment on the Land side of Norfolk which I hope they never will be able to
      force here we are wit~ only a very small part of a Regiment contending against the extensive
      Colony of Virginia; if you would but Spare me for a few Months the 64th Regiment now in the
      Castle and the remaining part of the 14th I realy believe we should reduce this Colony to a
      proper sense of their Duty. I am Dear General [&amp;c.]</P>

   <P>Since my Letter of the 15th Instant by the Amity's Providence Transport, in which I did myself
      the Honor to inclose a Copy of the Savage's Journal and other Papers.</P>
   <P>I am to inform you that Mr <name>Benney the Collector of Canso</name>, who resides at that Place during the
      fishing Season in the Summer and returns to this Place in the Fall where he remains the Winter
      brings an Account that on the 20th past two armed Schooners 2 commanded by Borden [Broughton
      J&amp; Salmon [Selman] armed with four four pounders, and two Six twelve Swivel Guns, eighty
      Men each, armed with Pistols each, and a Tomihawk, or a Cutlass. They are also well provided
      with Oars, belong to Marblehead; Anchored in Canso Road, where several Vessels were likewise
      at an Anchor. They ordered all the Masters onboard and examined them as to their Cargo's and
      destination. They also informed the Masters of the Vessels that they acted by orders from
      General Washington in consequence of the Resolves of Congress not to suffer any Lumber or
      other Supply's to be carried to any part of the West Indies or other Dominions of Great
      Britain, but to France and Spain yes. </P>
   <P>They were not to permit any sort of Thing to be sent to Boston, but to take all Vessels bound
      thither and on that presumption they took a small Schooner with forty Tubbs of Butter, the
      only Vessel they carried away from Canso.3 </P>
   <P>They came from the Island of <name>St John</name> where they have not done the smalest Damage except making
      a Prisoner the Lieut Governor 4 under pretence of his having enlisted several Volenteers for
      the Boston Army and Malitia. They do also make diligent search after their Deserters, but
      wether they have taken any I cannot say. </P>
   <P>I have undoubted Authority to say these Vessels put into Barrington on Sunday last [November
      26] and took a Brigantine laden with Fish bound to the West Indies,5 sail'd from thence the
      following Day and steered to the Westward. </P>
   <P>At 4 Oclock yesterday in the Afternoon, Anchored in the Harbour from Cork two Transports the
      Venus and America with Brigadier Genl [Eyre] Massey &amp; six Companies of his the 27th Regt
      who are to remain here the rest of that Corps being hourly expected to arrive. </P>
   <P>I had directed Captain Duddingston of the Senegal to victual and Store his Ship for Six
      Months, and proceed to the Bay of Fundy, and cruize as long as the Season will permit and if
      Necessary to winter at Annapolis [Royal], But those orders I have altered on the Information I

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Cambridge 1st Decr 1775 -</P>
   <P>Your favour of the 27th came safe to hand at a time when we were all flush'd with the
      agreeable Accot of Capt Manly's having taken a prize of the utmost Consequence, which made us
      look over the Potatoes &amp; turnips of Capt Adams, but now being a little cool, I assure you
      I do not think Adams ban fortune so despicable tho' of little Value to us, it is depriving the
      Enemy of what to them, wou'd be of Consequence, as to the Prisoners I wish you had kept or
      discharged them as in future, you will please to let the Committee examine such as in these
      Circumstances may fall into your hands &amp; they will Judge of the best Method of disposing
      of them - the Money you advance must be a Charge against the Capture - I doubt not of Captain
      Adams's frugality &amp; Attention, you will therefore Supply him with what Necessarys he Calls
      for, you will please to dispose of the Cargo by the Rainbow,2 &amp; Lay up the Schooner until
      further Orders - tho' if a reasonable price can be got for her, you may dispose of her, this
      is left to your better Judgment - I have Supply <name>Benja Chandler</name> ten Dollars towards defreying
      their expence back, this must also become a Charge upon the Capture, I hope Adams will soon
      take such a prize as Manly has, I realy believe the Cargo Cou'd not Cost Short of £10,000
      Sterlg-to us it is invaluable - Adieu my dear Sir, [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>Sir </P>
   <P>Cambridge 1st Decr 1775-</P>
   <P>Your favours of the 23rd &amp; 29th Ulto are come to hand - <name>Capt Coit</name>'s Lieutenant has been
      here, gives an Account of his Schooner being so Old &amp; Crazy as to be unfit for the Service
      She is imploy'd in, if there was a possibility of fixing a better Vessel out, in Six or eight
      days &amp; removing the guns &amp;c from on board the Schooner, his Excellency wou'd be glad
      it cou'd be done, as there are Storeships &amp; transports expected all this Month, but that
      Mutinous Spirit which reigns thro' the Marines &amp; Sailors makes the General dispair of your
      being able to effect this to any purpose, so that I believe it is best to give the Affair up,
      &amp; not put the Publick to an unnecessary expence, you must be the proper Judge in this
      matter, to you <name>His Excellency</name> Leaves it Adverting that if the Vessel Cannot be fitted &amp;
      Men willing to go in her, within the abovementioned time, you are to Lay the Schooner up, have
      the Ammunition Stores &amp; every thing on board Carefully Secured, a proper Inventory taken
      of them Signed by the proper Officers, &amp; transmitted to Head Quarters, by first good
      Conveyance-Should this be Necessary you will please to inform Captain Coit, that it is His
      Excellency's Orders that he make what dispatch he Can to Camp with the Men under his
      Command-</P>
   <P>As to Captain Martindale's People, it is his Excellency's Orders, that all such as are
      unwilling to proceed to Cruize with him, be immediately sent to Camp to join their respective
      Regiments under the Care of an Officer, &amp; if Captain Martindale Can with your assistance
      get people to go with him, they shall Receive 40/, LMo p Month, &amp; One third of all prizes
      they may have the good Luck to Make - divided agreeable to the instructions given unto the
      Captain, indeed the Shares I believe will be on a better Plan than therein Mentioned as it is
      now under Consideration of Congress to allow one third of all Vessels &amp; Cargoes to the
      Captors - Should you &amp; Captain Martindale find it impossible to get Men on these terms in
      a reasonable time I must only say, that the deficiency of publick Spirit in this Country is
      much more, than I cou'd possibly have an Idea of-</P>
   <P><name>His Excellency</name> has been abroad whilest I wrote the foregoeing - it is his desire that as the
      Brigte 2 is So well fitted, that at all events she must be sent out to Cruize - she is on the
      publick service, &amp; Ceremony Must be waved, so that if <name>Capt Martindale</name> Cannot get hands to
      go with him, you Must put in Captain Coit or any one else that Can as his being detaind in
      Port now may be of the utmost Prejerdice to the American Cause, fourteen Transports with
      military stores Saild in Company with one now taken by Capt Manly, of imense value his Crew
      will Make their fortunes by Manlys activity. I am Sorry to think that this is a qualification
      that Martindale is defficient in, at Least he has given reason for the General to think
      so-</P>
   <P>Coud not a Crew for the Brigte be picked out of both Vessels, in fine get her out, Let the
      expence be what it will, &amp; put what Captain &amp; Crew you think best for the good of the
      Service on board of her- </P>

   <P>Mr <name>Francis Malbone</name> this day going on board <name>Capt Wallace</name> by order of the Council, in the
      Absence of Mr [Samuel] Dyre, He the Said <name>Capt Wallace</name> Immediately asked him the Opinion of the
      Town Relating the two officers 2 taken the Night before in the Town &amp; Carried to head
      Quarters whether it was not a Breach of the Truce, and was Answered by Mr Malbone that they
      were not taken by the Inhabitants of the Town therefore the Town Could not have Violated the
      Truce on which he <name>Capt Wallace</name> said he Esteemed it as a Violation of the Truce, and that he
      then made a Demand of the Town that the Two Officers at Quarters Should be Returned, if they
      were not he would make all the Prisoners in his Powers which he was Sure would be many, on
      which he Mr Malbone Answered that Mr Dyre was Expected from Providence &amp; Desired that he
      would Suffer the Boats to Pass until his Return which he Promised he would do, and threatened
      much that if those two officers were not Released that he would have Satisfaction of the Town
      for Suffering the Armed Men coming into Town with Many Threats &amp;c After Capt Malbone had
      taken the Greatest Pains to Convince him that it could not be a Breach of the Truce, he
      Answered that he had Given Possitive Orders that none of his Men Should go on Shore but that
      those two Officers Landed in the way of their Duty in Pursuit of three of their Men who had
      Run away and their Intention was not to Disturb the Peace of the Town, when Immediately on
      their Landing before they Got of[f] the Wharfe they were taken, and As the [he] Looked on the
      Town to be in a State of Neutrality therefore the takeing of his Officers and Makeing them
      Prisoners was a Violation of the Truce and Insisted upon their being Returned and as the Town
      is in Great want of Wood &amp; other Necessaries which will be Stopt unless this Affair is
      Setled which will put us in the Utmost Distress, We therefore pray Your Honor to take the Same

   <P>New London, December 1.</P>
   <P>Last Monday Night, [November 27] Capt. <name>Jeremiah Halsey</name> arrived Express from Canada, to his
      Honor Governor Trumbull, at Lebanon, with the following important and interesting
      Intelligence, viz. </P>
   <P>That on the Night of the 12th Instant General Carleton, after having spiked up the Cannon, and
      drove Balls into the Muzzles, robbed the Merchants of what Quantities of Powder they were
      possessed off, shipped it and all the small Arms on board the Transports and armed Vessels;
      and, with about 100 Soldiers, and as many Canadian Tories as were inclined to go, embarked and
      abandoned the City of Montreal. - That on Monday the 13th, the Inhabitants, after being
      assured that they would be allowed the free Exercise of their Religion, and that their
      Property should not be invaded, opened the Gates, and gave Possession to our Forces, under the
      Command of General Montgomery. </P>
   <P>It is imagined that General Carleton will not reach Quebec with his Forces, and that he is
      only carrying down the Powder, small Arms, &amp;c. to save us the Trouble; as we have a
      Detachment of our Army at the Mouth of the River Sorrel, under the Command of Colonel Easton,
      with several Pieces of Cannon, which, it is thought, may annoy his Fleet - If that should
      fail, Colonel Arnold, who was at Point Levi, opposite Quebec, when the last Intelligence was
      received from him, it is thought either is, or will be in Possession of that Place, before
      this Foxy General can get there; and will undoubtedly, be able to give a good Account of him. </P>

   <P>Dec. 1.</P>
   <P>A report has spread that Gov. Tryon and 700 Highlanders have landed somewhere below Fort
      Johnston, and have been joined by 700 men from this Province, and that they are marching
      toward Salisbury and Mecklenburg; Gov. Martin commands one regiment and Gov. Tryon the other.
      The news was brought by a traveller, who heard it from Capt. Zapfenfeld, who had been
      preparing to march his company to Salisbury, to general muster, when he received a letter from
      Mr. Fields, of Guilford County, containing the above information, which he had heard from two
      English officers. </P>

      reports were largely without foundation, but present an interesting study of the current
      rumors and their effect on the settlers. Tryon did not return to North Carolina, Governor
      Martin remained aboard his ship; and no royal troops landed in North Carolina during these
      months, though several groups of Highlanders arrived and joined their fellowcountrymen in the
      Cross Creek neighborhood, where loyalist officers secretly endeavored to arouse sentiment in
      favor of the King.&quot; </P>

   <P>in Rebellion Road 1 Decr 1775. </P>
   <P>In the present critical &amp; distress'd situation of Affairs I cannot express how happy I
      think myself in meeting your Excellency in this Province a Pleasure I have long and ardently
      wished for. A mature consideration of the state of the two Carolinas and Georgia will I
      conceive make it very apparent that every rebellious measure which has been adopted in this
      part of the continent originated in Charlestown, and should we be able with our little Force
      to make any impression here I am convinced it would be attended with the best consequences,
      not only in this but in the neighbouring Governments. As this is my firm opinion I most
      sincerely hope that while we have any prospect of effecting this great point your Excellency
      will agree with me in thinking our Force should not be divided; But should it be thought
      impracticable to do anything material in this Province, I shall not hesitate a moment in going
      wherever the King's Arms can be employed to the greatest advantage. We are engaged, Sir, in
      one common cause and I have not a doubt but we shall maintain the most cordial Friendship, and
      you may command every information it is in my power to give that can assist you in judging on
      this occasion of the real State of this important Province. I am with the greatest esteem Sir
      [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>Scorpion Sloop of War </P>
   <P><name>My Lord</name></P>
   <P>in Rebellion Road, Decr 1st 1775. </P>
   <P>I am honoured with your Excellency's Letter of this Day's date by the hand of Captain Innes,
      and I feel myself sensibly obliged by your Lordships very kind &amp; flattering expressions of
      your satisfaction on my arrival in this Province. </P>
   <P>The Pleasure I enjoy in meeting your Excellency in your Government I owe to the prevalence of
      your Lordship's insistances with Captain Thornbrough to order the Scorpion Sloop of War from
      her station at <name>No Carolina</name> to this place, that reduced me to the necessity of choosing between
      the alternatives of returning to my very inconvenient and streigtened quarters on board the
      Cruizer Sloop, whose little Force did not assure me of protection from the Rebels in that
      Colony, or of coming hither in the Scorpion, which I could not think myself justified in
      detaining there while I was taught to believe that danger so nearly impended, or rather so
      closely pressed, upon your Excellency and Captain Thornbrough. Amidst this choice of
      difficulties, I determined on the latter part; that the Scorpion might give such succour as
      your immediate exigencies should require; and that I might at the same time concert some plan
      of operations for the restoration of his Majesty's Government in both our Provinces, agree[a
      ]ble to your Lordship's proposition to me by your Letter of September, on being made
      acquainted with the foundation of it; and make my representations to your Excellency, and to
      Captain Thornbrough on the expediency of the Scorpion's return to her appointed Station in
      North Carolina; where the posture of affairs is so critical and in a state promising so great
      advantages to Government as to demand every cherishing support and all my most vigilant
      attention. In this situation of things, your Lordship, I am persuaded will not be surprised,
      that my satisfaction on meeting you here is not without alloy, arising from the anxiety &amp;
      solicitude, of which I cannot possibly divest myself, while I am conscious of being out of the
      Sphere of my Duty to the King; and when I consider, that I am remote from my proper station,
      which becomes every Day more interesting and important, and wherein I expect very soon to be
      enabled effectually to promote His Majesty's Service. </P>
   <P>It can little avail your Excellency or myself to Enquire, or to know where the now generally
      prevailing Spirit of Rebellion in America originated. It is a melancholy Truth, of which no
      Evidence is wanting, that at this Day it is spread almost universally over this Continent;
      that both our Provinces have received the fatal contagion and that they are deeply involved in
      all the Criminality and Guilt belonging to it; and I flatter myself your Lordship will do me
      the justice to believe, that I am most heartily willing, and disposed to cooperate with your
      Lordship for the restoration of His Majesty's Government in the one &amp; the other. My Duty
      to the King as Govr of <name>No Carolina</name> Your Lordship knows necessarily makes the reclaiming that
      Province to obedience to lawful authority the first object of my attention, next to that, my
      wishes would lead me to make myself as much, and as far useful as my humble abilities may
      render me to His Majesty's Services in general; and I should be particularly happy to find
      myself in any situation to be at all conducive to the success of Your Lordship's endeavours to
      restore the authority of His Majesty's Government in this Colony. An Impression made here or
      anywhere else <name>My Lord</name> at this time would produce extensive; good effects without doubt, and no
      opportunity of making it ought to be neglected but I am not acquainted with any means your
      Lordship has to make impression here in the present moment and your Excellency must be
      sensible from my representations of the State of North Carolina how unfit and unbecoming as
      well as how unjustifiable it would be in me to desert my Post there and to turn my back upon
      all my fair prospects of reducing that Colony to order, on pretence of watching in your
      Excellency's Province and Department for possible or even probable, remote, favorable
      contingencies, of which your Lordship expects to avail yourself for the restoration of the
      authority of Government here, &amp; that I may sincerly hope may accomplish all your good
      wishes. </P>
   <P>As I do not understand that His Majesty's Service can be at all promoted by the Scorpion's
      stay here at this time and as my Duty indispensibly and pressingly urges my return to North
      Carolina, I have requested Captain Thornbrough to order the Scorpion to repair to her Station,
      forthwith, lamenting that I have it not in my power to spend more time with your Excellency at
      present. </P>
   <P>I beg leave to repeat my assurances to your Excellency, that I shall be very happy on every
      occasion to cooperate with you for the advancement of His Majesty's Service, and to maintain
      the kindest reciprocations of Friendship, by every means of communication and correspondence. </P>

   <P>JOURNAL OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS </P>
   <P>[Philadelphia] Saturday, December 2, 1775 -</P>
   <P>A letter from the Committee of Northampton, in Virginia, with sundry papers containing matters
      of importance being received was read.</P>
   <P>On motion made, Resolved, That the same be referred to the Committee appointed to take into
      consideration the state of Virginia.</P>
   <P>As one of the members of that Committee is absent, Resolved, That another member be chosen,
      and added to the Committee in the room of the member absent.2 </P>
   <P>The member chosen, Mr. [William] Paca.</P>
   <P>Resolved, That the Committee for fitting out armed vessels be instructed and directed to
      confer with Captain [William] Stone, and engage him and his vessel, on the most reasonable
      terms, in the service of the Continent, for the purpose of taking or destroying the cutters
      and armed vessels in Chesapeake Bay, under Lord Dunmore.</P>
   <P>Resolved, That Colonel [Benjamin] Harrison do immediately proceed to Maryland, and be
      empowered in conjunction with the delegates of that colony to this Congress, or any one or
      more of them, [to] take such measures, as appear to them most effectual t? procure, with all
      possible despatch, on continental charge, two or three armed vessels to proceed immediately to
      cruize on, take or destroy as many of the armed vessels, cutters, and ships of war of the
      enemy as possible, that may be found in the bay of Chesapeake, or any of its dependencies, or
      coasts of Virginia and Maryland. </P>
   <P>Whereas, designs are formed by certain ministerial partizans in the counties of Norfolk and
      Princess Ann, and some other parts of Virginia, on Chesapeake bay, under the influence of Lord
      Dunmore, to contravene the non-exportation agreement, by exporting provisions and other
      produce of that Country to the West India Islands, and thereby injure the interest and weaken
      the efforts of the United Colonies, in opposing the present oppressive system of the British
      ministry. </P>
   <P>Resolved, therefore, That the said armed vessels be authorised and directed to seize and
      detain, until the further order of this Congress, all such ships and vessels as they may find
      employed in such exportations from the places aforesaid. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That the committee for fitting out armed vessels be directed to employ the armed
      sloop, commanded by Captain Whipple, of Rhode Island, now on a voyage to this port, and
      despatch her forthwith to aid the marine business to the southward. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That the committee for fitting out armed vessels be directed to prepare a proper
      commission for the Captains or Commanders of the ships of war in the service of the United
      Colonies. </P>
   <P>On motion made, Resolved, That orders issue to the Colonel of the Pensylvania Battalion, now
      in the Barracks at Philadelphia, to send a detachment of his regiment and keep a regular guard
      on the wharves of Messrs. Willing and Morris, and Mr. [James] Cuthbert, to take care of the
      ships and stores .belonging to the United Colonies. </P>
   <P>The Committee appointed to prepare the form of a commission, &amp;c. reported the same, which
      was read and agreed to. </P>
   <P>Ordered, That 300 be immediately printed, with proper blanks. </P>
   <P>The Congress then resumed the Consideration of the General's letters, and the report of the
      Committee of Conference, who went to Cambridge:</P>
   <P>The Congress resumed the consideration of the report of the Committee of conference; and
      thereupon came to the following resolutions: </P>
   <P>Resolved, That all persons taken in arms on board any prize, be deemed prisoners at the
      disposal of the General, whether prizes be taken by vessels fitted out in the pay of the
      Continent or by others. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That such as are taken be treated as prisoners of war, but with humanity, and
      allowed the same rations as the troops in the service of the Continent; that the officers
      being in pay should supply themselves with cloaths, their bills to be taken therefor, that the
      soldiers be furnished as they riow are. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That an exchange of prisoners will be proper, citizens for citizens, officers for
      officers of equal rank, and soldier for soldier. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That the Committee of Correspondence be directed to use their endeavours to find out
      and engage in the service of the united colonies skilful engineers not exceeding four, on the
      best terms they can, and that the said Committee be authorised to assure such able and skilful
      engineers as will engage in this service, that they shall receive such pay and appointments as
      shall be equal to what they have received in any former service. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That the Congress approve the General's fitting out armed vessels to intercept the
      enemy's supplies. </P>
   <P>Ordered, That the resolutions passed on the General's letters, and on the report of the
      Committee of Con£ erence, and such other resolutions as relate to the establishment of the new
      army, not already forwarded, be sent by express to the General. </P>
   <P>The Congress being informed that Mr. <name>Ethan Allen</name>, who was taken prisoner near Montreal, is
      confined in irons on board a vessel in the river St. Lawrence,</P>
   <P>Ordered, That General Washington be directed to apply to General Howe on this matter, and
      desire he may be exchanged. </P>

   <Title>MINUTES OF THE PENNSYLVANIA COMMITTEE OF SAFETY 1</Title>
   <P>Philadelphia, December 2nd. 1775</P>
   <P>Resolved, That Capt. Dougherty be instructed not to permit more than two Captains, and a

   <P>As Capt. Whipple is not yet arrived, we can say nothing respecting his being taken into
      Continental service. General Hopkins, this morning, desired us to acquaint you that 'tis yet a
      matter of doubt whether he engages in the service here or not. He seems to think the
      encouragement given to the seamen so small that a sufficient number cannot be raised in time
      to do anything to purpose this season, and that if he does not engage in this service, he will
      set out for home as soon as his son and young Mr. Jenckes are well of the small pox.2 They
      were inoculated last Wednesday [November 29], and are still about the streets ...</P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>Since our last We have the Honor of two Letters from you; Genl Hopkins has arrived very well,
      his accepting the Command of the Fleet gives universal Satisfaction: 2 <name>Capt Whipple</name> is not yet
      arrived; We are a little embarrassed about the Vessel, the Comee informs us that the Colony
      considers her as belonging to the Continent &amp; in their Service &amp; propose to be repaid
      for her &amp; the Wages of the People if so will not refusing to let her cooperate with the
      Fleet wherever destined frustrat[e] the Design of repayment for her &amp; past Services. We
      wish your Honors farther Directions on this Head &amp; hope they may arrive before there is a
      Necessity of coming to any Resolution about it, but if not We shall advise <name>Capt Whipple</name> to
      follow his Instructions. 3 </P>

   <Title><name>GILBERT BARKLY</name> TO SIR <name>GREY COOPER</name> 1</Title>
   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>[Philadelphia] 2d December 1775</P>
   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>As the Post Office is now entirely under the direction of the Congress and all letters Oppned
      and read by a Comittee appointed for that purpose, the outmost precaution is Necessary to keep
      my Intelligence from hence, from their knowledge, this and the importnce of the discovery I
      have made, Urged me to Apply to a man of who's fidelity I have the best Oppinnion, to go
      Express with this by the Packet from New York. </P>
   <P>Tuo Ships, one, to carry thirty four guns, and the other thirty, with tuo briganteens to mount
      sixteen guns each, are fitting out at this Port with great diligence, the whole of them
      Extream fast sailing Vessels: 2 My outmost Efforts have been used to find out their
      destination which with much dificulty I have Effectuated by the force of money.</P>
   <P>They are to proceed to the Island of Acention, and Cruize betuixt it and the Island of St
      Helena for the homeward bound East India ships, which they are to take and carry into the most
      Convenient Ports they can get to in this Country; the great Object of this Expedition is in
      order to get possession of the salt petre generaly brought home by them, with the assistance
      of which their oun mills can make any quantity of gun pouder they require; this discovery Sir
      I recone an object of the first magnitude, particularly as I flatter myself, it will arrive
      time enough for dispatching men of war to frustrate such an Arrogant designe.3 </P>
   <P>It is Very extraordinary that there has been no kings ships in this river for above three
      months past, many Vessells from hence are applying at foreign Ports for gun pouder and arms
      etc: I understand from some who arrived lately from St Ustatia, that there was none to be got
      at any price in that Island, nor can I learn of any got from the French Islands of late, which
      has mightely damped their sanguin expectations. </P>
   <P>There is 20000 barrels of flower just now ashiping off by order, and for account and risque of
      the Congress, to go ahunting to different Ports for gunpouder, and Arm's etc: the places of
      their destination, I cannot learn, nor do I beleive they are yet fixed on, however if Cruizers
      are appointed on this Coast early in the Spring, it will be deficult for them to get into
      Port. </P>
   <P>The Northern Assemblies are making Acts to encourage the fitting out Privateers and assuredly
      if they can only get gun pouder, (as they are making Cannon and ball) those Vermin will prove
      troublesome. . . . </P>
   <P>The great object they had in view by the Expedition to Cannada is the expectation of geting
      Possesion of the Kings military stores, of which I flatter myself they will be frustrated,
      gunpouder above all things is the article they are most in want of, and if they are deprived
      in Supply's of that article, their great boastings will soon be at an end: much is expected
      from the Success of the Expedition I have mentioned, and in order to give it the Apperance of
      making a just Reprisall, they are gathering an account of the Value of the Howses, burnt at
      Charles town by the King's troops, and others destroyed by the Kings Ships, as also the Value
      of the Vessells Caryed into Boston, etc. by the men of war: this is adoing by express orders
      from the Congress.4 </P>
   <P>I am still of Oppinnion if a powrful army, and some men of war, was sent to this place in the
      Spring and a Royal Proclamation published, with the promjse of Pardon to those who would Join
      the Kings standard, that it wou'd have the best Effects: Should this happen they would
      disperss the Congress, and thousands of those who are at present in Army, would join the Kings
      forces. </P>
   <P>I doubt not but the Vessells I have mentioned, will saill in less, than a month from this date
      as the utmost dilligence is used in fitting them out . . . </P>
   <P>3d December Since I finished my letter I am informed that a twenty gun Ship from Road Island
      is to join those fitting out at this place.5 500 Sea men are also coming from the Northeren
      Provences to man those Ships, and one million of dollars is to be struck for the avowed
      support of a Navy, in short they are so daring in their designes, that unless great Britain
      exerts her self to strick an Effectual Stroke, and that Speedely, the Consequence may prove
      fatal . . . </P>
   <P>It is thought that some of the ships who have sailled, and others who are ready to saill with
      Flowr, are intended for France, and Spain, in order to procure gunpouder and Arms, and I'm
      told some V essells, are gone to Denmark, and Sueden, on the same designe, in short every
      Effort they can think of is made use of to get provided in those Articles. </P>

      <name>Henry Barkly</name> Papers) of Mrs. <name>Mona MacMillan</name> of Long Whittenham, Berkshire, England. Gilbert
      Barkly was an occasional resident of Philadelphia and acted as a British spy there during the
      early years of the Revolut1on. He &quot;described his mission in a Memorial to General Howe
      dated November 10, 1776, wherein he wrote: &quot;I was ordered out to Philadelphia by Lord
      North in March 1775 with orders to exert myself to bring about an accomodation, and to give
      inteligence of the Proceedings of the Congress etc .... &quot; Ibid., 35. Sir <name>Grey Cooper</name> was

   <P>Dear Sir</P>
   <P>[Philadelphia, December 2] 2 </P>
   <P>We have had nothing new since the reduction of Montreal, which I suppose you must have heard
      of. It is supposed Arnold must be in possession of Quebec by this time, if he shou'd be too
      weak to effect it, Montgomerie will join him from Montreal. At all events we have got the most
      valuable part of Canada, as it cuts off all communication with the Indians, &amp; prevents
      inroads on our fronteers. It wou'd give me infinite pleasure, if our affairs to the Southward
      wore as favorable an Aspect; it will require very vigorous efforts, to put a stop to the
      proceedings of Lord Dunmore. We are extreamly alarm'd by an express from the Comtee of N
      orthhampton County to Congress, informing that he has issued a Proclamation, declaring
      military Law in Virga &amp; offering freedom to all servants &amp; slaves, who shall repair to
      the King's standard, which he has erected; That the inhabitants of Norfolk &amp; Princess Ann
      Counties have taken an Oath to oppose, to the last drop of their blood, any of their
      Countrymen who shall come in arms into their Counties. The Comtee asks for assistance, being
      apprehensive that their people from their exposed situation, &amp; the number of their slaves,
      will thro fear, be induced to follow the example of the other two Counties. We have got the
      Proclamation I have been thus full, least the letters from Northhampton to our Comtee of
      safety, shoud be intercepted; which they were apprehensive of. this intelligence gives great
      concern to all the real friends of America; &amp; subjects Your Countrymen to the sneers of
      its disguised Enemies, &amp; the lukewarm Fatal consequences may follow if an immediate stop
      is not put to that Devil's career. </P>
   <P>I shoud think a sufficient force of Militia or Minute men shou'd immediately be sent to drive
      him &amp; his adherent on board the ships; The estates of the inhabitants of Norfolk, or
      elsewhere, who have taken arms agst the Country shoud be sequesterd for its defence. The
      proclamation burnt by the hangman, &amp; heav'y penalties inflicted on those who disperse them
      thro' the Country. the patroles shou'd be very diligent. will it not be necessary for the
      convention by a short Ordinance, to establish the present Laws &amp; Judges? It wou'd
      contribute more than anything to the quiet &amp; safety of the people, &amp; security of our
      commerce in the spring, if the Convention wou'd exert themselves in fitting out small armed
      Vessells, to prevent small tenders from infesting the bays &amp; rivers; if it cannot be done
      in Virga they might be procured here. probably Virga might spare powder for this purpose, but
      without very bad fortune we shall soon have it in. it is inconceivable what good effects have
      been produced from such a measure to the Northward, not a tender dares to come from under the
      Guns of the large ships; &amp; the Vessells employ'd by the Army in Boston to procure wood
      &amp; provisions are every day falling into our hands. There are small guns in several parts
      of Virga, a few at Robb's hole, &amp; Col. [William] Fauntleroys. the'furnaces shoud be set to
      casting them. God prosper your deliberations. - Yr afft friend </P>

   <P>Since Lord Dunmore's proclamation made its appearance here, it is said he has recruited his
      army, in the counties of Princess Anne and Norfolk, to the amount of about 2000 men, including
      his black regiment, which is thought to be a considerable part, with this inscription on their
      breasts: - &quot;Liberty to Slaves.&quot; - However, as the rivers will henceforth be strictly
      watched, and every possible precaution taken, it is hoped others will be effectually prevented
      from joining those his Lordship has already collected. </P>
   <P>The army that went down last week, under command of Col. Woodford, to obstruct Dunmore's
      progress of enlisting men in the lower counties, fell in with a party of twelve or thirteen of
      Dunmore's friends, and made them all prisoners. Lieut. Col. [Charles] Scott, with the advanced
      guard, upon his arrival at the Great Bridge, found the enemy entrenched there, and it is said
      a smart firing began by some of the riflemen, which was returned, and continued a considerable
      time on both sides, but to what effect we know not. It is also said, that Thursday last
      [November 28] was fixed upon by our troops to begin a general attack; they were healthy; in
      good spirits, and had great prospect of success. </P>
   <P>Some accounts from Norfolk are, that Dunmore's party has demolished several houses b~ck of the
      town, and fortified themselves; also, that Col. [Joseph] Hutchings, and some other Gentlemen,
      their prisoners, had been removed to the ships on account of the gaol having been set on fire. </P>
   <P>Last Wednesday night [November 28] some of Dunmore's bandits, about 12, mostly Negroes, came
      ashore, and went to the house of Mr. <name>Benjamin Wells</name>, at Mulberry island; after threatening and
      abusing him in a most infamous manner, they robbed him of all his most valuable effects, and
      carried off two Negro women. </P>

   <P>Dear General</P>
   <P>The bearer of this whose name is <name>John Eustace</name> is the Son of an unfortunate widow Gentlewoman
      in this Country, I have had the Care of Him for these three Years past, and have given him the
      best Education this Country could afford. He is a very good latin scholar, of exceeding good
      Spirit, &amp; quick parts, of excellent temper, &amp; good disposition, has conceived a great
      desire to go into the Army, I have therefore to intreat you when an opportunity offers to give
      him a Commission, &amp; I think he will do me no discredit, &amp; you much Service; if you are
      kind enough to employ him, I should be much obliged to you if you would recommend him to some
      prudent Officer who would take the trouble now and then to give him a little good advice for
      the only fault I know in him (if it can be called one in a Boy) is that he is a little
      Volatile; pray spare us some troops if you can possibly do it, consistant with your Orders,
      even the Recruits of the 14th Regt would be of service to us; those ordered from St Augustine
      are not yet arrived, tho' hourly expected, was the whole Regt here I think we should be able
      to do some good. I have sent you a Sloop 2 with some Indian Corn, Oats, &amp; a few Irish
      potatoes, all of which he told me (I mean Major Connolly) were much wanted, I could have sent
      you any quantity of Oats (such as they are), if I could have got a larger vessel; I wish to
      God I had some of your Light Horse here, this is a fine Country for them to act in, and food
      of all kinds in great abundance for both men &amp; Horses; a winter Campaign would reduce,
      without the smallest doubt the whole of this southern Continent to a perfect state of
      obedience, one esential service it would render you, which is that I could supply your Army
      &amp; Navy with every necessary of life &amp; that in the greatest abundance, which is more
      than any other Colony on the Continent could do. I ever am Dear General [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>Otter Sloop off Norfolk. 2d Decr 1775</P>
   <P><name>My Lord</name> Dunmore having a quantity of Corn - which he understands would be of great service to,
      (and was much wanted for the Cavalry to the Northward) and beg'd I would send some men in a
      Sloop to carry it to Boston, I have therefore for the good of the service, sent a Petty
      Officer and six of my People in the <name>Betsey Sloop</name> for that purpose, In my last to you of the
      13th September by the Mercury, I informed you that the People of this part of Virginia seem'd
      to be peaceably inclined, but am sorry to say that for these two months past, they have taken
      every method to annoy the Kings Ships, Boats &amp; Troops where-ever they see them, firing on
      them on all occasions. I some time since went in a Tender with three other Tenders in Company
      in order to prevent their sinking Vessels in the mouth of Hampton Harbour when they fired on
      me, and killed two of my People, and wounded two more, and from the imprudence of the Officer
      on board a small Tender running to near the town, their Musquetry was so great that several of
      my People swam from her to me, and the Rebels took the Vessel with four men, which Men they
      have since returned. On the 14 of last Month <name>His Excellency</name> Lord Dunmore, and the detachment
      of the 14th Regiment embarked in Boats from Portsmouth, and went up a River near a place
      called the Great Bridge intending to dislodge some men that he had heard was there, whose
      intention was to stop Provisions coming to Norfolk. His Lordship from thence, in his March to
      Norfolk, was attack'd and fired on by some Rebels whom he soon drove off, after killing one,
      and taking seven or eight Prisoners, with a Colonel Lawson &amp; Colonel Hutchins men who have
      been very buisy in currupting the minds of the Poor deluded people of this Colony: His
      Lordship then issued his Proclamation (a copy of which I send you,) As Mr <name>John Atkinson</name> the
      Petty Officer that brings you this, was a Volunteer with Lord Dunmore on the expedition I
      refer you to him for more particulars. We have now a small fort at the Great Bridge, which the
      Rebels must pass to come to Norfolk. we have destroyed the Bridge, and for these ten days
      past, have kept a body of near nine hundred Rebels from passing. We have likewise entrenched
      the town of Norfolk, and I have great reason to suppose, &amp; hope from their being such
      Cowards, and Cold weather coming on, that they will return to their respective homes, &amp; we
      shall be quiet the remainder of the Winter. I am securing all the Provisions I can, for the
      King's Ships and hope to get a sufficient quantity untill we can have a supply from the
      Northward. I must hope sir when in your Power to spare a Victualer you will send one. </P>
   <P>I by desire have sent two Prisoners taken by his Lordship no doubt but his Lordship has sent
      their accusations; Two - other Prisoners taken by <name>Captn Montagu</name> the one <name>Captn Dean</name>, whose
      accusation I here inclose, the other a Captn Porter 2 for bringing Powder and Shot for the
      Rebels, &amp; in sight of the King's Tenders throwing it overboard. Enclosed I send you the
      State and Condition of His Majestys Sloops Otter &amp; Kingsfisher, with the demands for
      Stores from the Officers of the said Sloops. </P>
   <P>I am well convinced that had we a few more troops, and one or two more Ships, that the Rebels
      in these parts would be very soon quieted. </P>
   <P>Am also to acquaint you, that from the Boatswain of the Otters frequently behaving in a
      tyrannical manner to the Ships Company, often Insolent to the Officers, as well as neglecting
      his duty, I have thought proper to suspend him, and have given an acting order to one of my
      Seamen. Enclosed I send you three Letters, which I received from St Augustine to be forwarded
      to you, and am Sir with assurances that all that can be done for the good of the Kings Service
      shall be done by Sir, [&amp;c.] </P>

      the King should be held ready to march at the slightest warning; Frasier had added that from

      had recently landed, and that a skirmish had probably already taken place. </P>

   <P>Long before the Receipt of this You will have heard by Express from the General, of the
      important Prize we have made in the Capture of the Brig Nancy loaded with Ordnance Stores for
      the Army at Boston. Orders were given that she should be unloaded with all possible Expedition
      &amp; we have now the greatest Part of her Cargo safely housed in the Labratory here. 2 The
      loss must be very great to the Enemy, but the Acquisition is immense to Us. Col. [William]
      Burbeck assured me that it would have taken eighteen Months to have prepar'd a like Quantity
      of Ordnance Materials, could they have been fumish'd with every Thing, requisite to make them.
      There are many Things which money could not have procur'd Us. I heard Col. [David] Mason say
      that, had all the Engineers of the Army been consulted they could not have made out a
      compleater Invoice of Military Stores, that we are now in Possession of. We want Nothing now
      but a Ship Load of Powder, to raise such a Clatter in the Streets of Boston, as to force
      George's Banditti to seek Protection in his Ships, or fly to his Ministers for Security </P>
   <P>Sunday Evening </P>
   <P>We have just had an Express from Marblehead which informs Us that the same Privateer, which

   <P>Sir </P>
   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 3 Decr 1775,</P>
   <P>By the General <name>Gage Sloop</name> who left Quebec the 9th of November and arrived here last Night, I
      received a Letter from Captain Hamilton of his Majesty's Ship Lizard, who got up the 5th of
      November with the Jacob, and <name>Elizabeth Brigs</name>, laden with Arms, Ammunition, Cloathing &amp;c.
      for the King's Army under General Carleton. Capt. Hamilton writes me the disagreeable News
      that the Garrison of <name>St John</name>'s surrendered themselves Prisoners of War the 2d of November;
      that Montreal is invested and must soon surrender, it being a place of no Strength and in Want
      of Provisions; that the Rebels are in possession of Point Levi, and General Carleton is on
      board the Gaspee coming to Quebec. It is more than ever necessary to keep Possession of and
      prevent the Rebels fortifying, the Sea Ports, and their getting Supplies of Provisions of any
      Sort to prolong the War. Inclosed you have an Order to detain the Asia. New York must at all
      Events be kept for the King. The short time the Ice is in the River you must bestow the Ships
      where you think best, and the moment you can place them before the Town let it be done.</P>
   <P>Intelligence this moment is received that the Rebels have a Frigate of 36 Guns, a Ship of 20.
      and others nearly ready at Philadelphia, and that they design to attack the Kings Ships at
      Virginia; 2 therefore if the Asia and Phoenix cannot safely winter at New York, go yourself to
      Virginia or send Captain Vandeput, which ever you think best for the Kings Service: but if
      both can remain at [New] York, I would have them there by all means. I expect the Liverpool
      and one or two Sloops are at Virginia. The Raven will call there in her way to Georgia. I need
      not urge the necessity for the most vigorous Efforts, for the Kings Service; we must by all
      means preserve our Ground untill the Spring, when we may depend upon considerable
      Reinforcements. I am Sir &amp;c</P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Boston, 3 December 1775</P>
   <P>I learn the Nancy Brigantine an Ordnance Transport - having on Board 4000 Stand of Arms
      complete 100,000 Flints, a Thirteen Inch Mortar with other Stores in Proportion, was taken in
      the Bay last week by the Rebels Privateers, and affords an Instance for this Necessity.2 The
      Circumstance is rather unfortunate to us, as they are now furnished with all the Requisites
      for setting the Town on Fire, having got a large Quantity of round Carcasses and other Stores,
      with which they could not have been otherwise Supplied. The particular manner whereby she was
      taken is not ascertained, but so many Artifices have been practised upon Strangers, under the
      Appearance of Friendship, false Pilots, &amp;ca that those coming out with Stores of any Kind
      cannot be put too much upon their Guard.</P>
   <P>And I submit to your Lordship the Necessity there may be of supplying the Loss of Arms Flints,
      &amp;ca suffered on this Occasion.</P>
   <P>The Admiral has informed me that, by a Letter received this Day from Captain Wallace, of the
      Rose Ship of War, stationed at Rhode Island, the Rebels give out they are to fortify the
      Heights above the Town of Newport; also that they are fitting out an armed Ship at
      Philadelphia to carry 36 Guns, and two or three more of a less Force, with a Design of
      Cruising to the Southward, and to take Lord Dunmore in their way. </P>

   <P>Camp at Roxbury 3 Decr. 1775</P>
   <P>The good success of our Privateers, which you will hear before this reaches you, is very
      encouraging, and, I hope it will stimulate the seafaring Gentlemen to greater exertions in
      that way. I think we have a prospect of important advantages from exertions by sea, and I
      hope, with you Sir, this will be done by the Colonies separately, as, for many reasons, that
      greater advantages will arise thereby to the great Cause of America . . . </P>
   <P>But very few Vessels have arrived at Boston from Britain for a long time, &amp; by the best
      accounts, not more than 250 of the great reinforcement which the Enemy have so long talked of
      I believe 2300 is the most that they expect this Fall: The Troops in Boston continue sickly,
      &amp; it is said they are not in so good Spirits as they were in the Summer: If we can obtain
      a supply of Powder I trust we shall give a good account of them before Spring; if it be
      possible we must subdue the Ministerial Fleet &amp; Army which is in America this Winter,
      otherwise we may expect a strong reinforcement in the Spring. Should we conquer what are here,
      I apprehend the Ministry would not hazard another expedition, but if they should we might be
      able to resist all their force. I think we have nothing to fear but ourselves, and if we do
      our duty we may gain every political advantage the heart of Man can desire. </P>

   <P>This is to whom it may concern, that I, <name>John Trevett</name>, sailed from Providence in a Sloop called
      the Catea [Katy], Commanded by <name>Abram Whipple</name>, E[sq.], of Providence, with a number of
      passengers, to sail with a fleet of armed vessels fixing at Philidelphia, in the month of Nov.
      1775. Arrived there the same month, and found 1 Ship called the Alfred, 1 Ship called the
      Columbus, 1 Brig called the Cabbot[, 1] brig called the <name>Andrew Doria</name>, and then our Sloop's
      name was altere[d] and she called the Providence. I went on board the Ship Columbus, as
      fir[st] Lieutenant of Marines, . . . 2 </P>
   <P>1. NHS.</P>
   <P>2. According to the roster of the Columbus., Trevett entered as a midshipman, and was promoted
      to lieutenant of marines on February 13, 1 i76. He had enrolled at Providence on November 20,
      1775, and the Katy arrived at Philadelphia on December 3, 1775. He was not, as his journal
      states, first lieutenant of marines. </P>

   <Title>CAPTAIN <name>JOHN STANTON</name> TO <name>FRANCIS LEGGE</name> 1</Title>
   <P>Sir -</P>
   <P>Halifax - 4th Decr - 1775</P>
   <P>I think it my duty to acquaint your Excellency that in compliance with your instructions I
      proceeded as far as Annapolis Royal in my way to <name>St John</name>'s River that during the course of
      seventeen days I repeatedly attempted to cross the Bay of Fundy but was each time drove back
      into the Basin of Annapolis by contrary winds - that as the beginning of the Winter had been
      uncommonly severe from violent gales of wind blowing from the North East - to the North West
      which had occasioned repeated Snow Storms and an intense frost - which, from the best
      information I could receive, wuld render the navigation of the River <name>St John</name>'s impracticable
      till the middle of January - I found it impossible therefore any further to attempt to
      penetrate to the Settlements of the Indians on <name>St. John</name>'s River and accordingly I left
      Annapolis on the 28th of Novr and returned to this place last night-</P>
   <P>I think it also my duty to acquaint your Excellency that in compliance with your request - I
      made it my constant employment, when on my journey to, &amp; from Annapolis, to converse with
      many of the Inhabitants of the several Townships through which I passed - in order to discover
      their Principles - Views - Sentiments - Wishes - Hopes - &amp; Fears -</P>
   <P>Very sorry am I to report on this occasion that their Principles are Republican -</P>
   <P>Their Views, to subvert the English Constitution in this Province -</P>
   <P>Their Sentiments, taken generally, are, that there is too much power vested in the Governor,
      and speaking consequent[ly upon] Principles, they assert, that all his authority should [line
      missing].</P>
   <P>Their Wishes are, that the Rebels of New Hampshire, and New England may invade this Province
      in the ensuing Spring - </P>
   <P>Their Hopes are, to profit by the confusion which they imagine will be the necessary
      consequence of the Invasion - </P>
   <P>Their Fears are, least by mistake they should join the weaker Party &amp; suffer with them
      accordingly -</P>
   <P>Early in the Summer they refused to send any Provisions or Vegetables to the Troops in Boston
      - they declared that they never would grant the least assistance to the Army which was
      endeavouring to inslave their friends &amp; Relations, meaning the Rebels, the people of New
      England, &amp; New Hampshire -</P>
   <P>But when the Tartar Frigate was stationed at Annapolis, the Senegal in the Bay of Fundy - and
      the Merlin in the Bas[in] of Minas - &amp; seeing no probability of the Rebels making a
      descent into this Province - they immediately dispatched m[any] Sloops &amp; Schooners laden
      with Provisions to Boston for which they received exorbitant prices -</P>
   <P>Yet they always abused the Masters of these Sloops &amp; Schooners on their return to this
      Province, affirming that they were enemies to their Relations of New England, by selling to
      the Troops in Boston the very articles with which they had intrusted them to sell - alledging
      that they should not have gone to Boston with the Provisions because they were Natives of New
      England -</P>
   <P>I can assure your Excellency, upon my Honor, that in all the conversations which I had with
      several English Men settled in Windsor - Horton - Cornwallis - Cumberl[and] &amp; Granville
      Townships they universally agreed - that all [line missing] &amp; Connecticut were attached to
      the Cause of the Rebels in New Englandthat in every Township where the greater number of
      Settlers were Natives of New England, they were always endeavo[r]ing to infuse their own
      Principles among all the other Settlers, of what Country soever - that they frequently
      declared, when heated in Argument - or intoxicated with liquor - that they would sooner kill
      an English Man than a Dog, and uttered many other Expressions equally base and inhuman in
      order to intimidate them -</P>
   <P>Several of the English Settlers therefore earnestly desired Me to sollicit your Excellency to
      use your Influence with the Commander in Chief of his Majesty's Troops at Boston - that a
      respectable .Force may be sent as early as possible in the Spring - to Annapolis - Cumberland,
      - &amp; Windsor - in which Case they asserted that they would repair to those respective
      Detachments on the first Alarm of an Invasion - ready to obey the Orders of the Officers
      respectively commanding -</P>
   <P>As this is a Measure essentially necessary to the Safety of this Province, I think it
      incumbent on Me to request, that your Excellency may be pleased to grant the Petition of these
      EnglishMen - they are loyal - they are attached to their Country - I sincerely believe that
      they will fight in defence of it - Before I conclude this letter I think it neces.5ary to
      observe that, as the Inhabitants of this Province are chiefly composed of the Natives of New
      Hampshire - New England - &amp; Connecticut - whose Relations are now in actual Rebellion -
      and as the same Principals reign [line missing] It would be imprudent in the highest degree to
      embody the Militia, even on an actual Invasion -</P>
   <P>As nineteen out of twenty are Natives of New England, New Hampshire, or Connecticut, what
      dependence or reliance could your Excellency have in such Troops? </P>
   <P>To put a Confidence in such Fellows, would be acting like the Man who cherished a Snake in his
      bosom, till heated with the warmth of his blood, it bit him to death.</P>

   <P>Sir</P>
   <P>I had the Honor of writing to you the 30th. Ulto. inclosing an Inventory of the Military
      Stores taken on board the Brigantine Nancy by Capt. Manly of the Armed Schooner Lee. - l have
      now to inform you that he has since sent into Beverly a Ship named the Concord, <name>James Lowrie</name>
      Master from Greenock in Scotland bound to Boston she has on board Dry Goods and Coals to the
      value of £3606,,9,,7, shiped by Crawford Anderson &amp; Co. and consigned to <name>James Anderson</name>
      Merchant in Boston. - it is mentioned in the Letters found on Board, that this Cargo was for
      the use of the Army, but on a Strict examination I find it is the Property of the Shipper's
      and the Person to whom consigned. Pray what is to be done with this Ship and Cargoe? and what
      with the Brigantine that brought the Military Stores? It war agreed in the conference last
      October, that all Vessels employed merely as transports and unarmed with their crews be set at
      Liberty, upon giving security to return to Europe, but that this Indulgence be not extended
      longer than 'till the first of April next. In the Shippers Letter they mention - &quot;You
      must procure a certificate from the General and Admiral, of the Concords being in the
      Government Service, such as the Glasgow Packet brought with her, which was of great service,
      procured a Liberty to Arm her which was refused us, also gave her a prefference for some
      recruits that went out in her.&quot; In another part of this Letter they say, &quot;Captain
      Lowrie will deliver you the contract for the Coals, we gave it to him as perhaps might be of
      use as a certificate of his Ship being employed in the Government Service.&quot; Every Letter
      on board breaths nothing but emmity [enmity] to this Country, and a vast number of them there
      are. </P>
   <P>It is some time since I recommended to the Congress, that they would institute a Court for the
      Trial of Prizes made by the Continental Armed Vessel, which I hope they have ere now taken
      into their consideration, otherwise I should again take the Liberty of urging it in the most
      pressing manner. . . . </P>
   <P>By the last accounts from the Armed Schooners sent to the River St. Lawrence, I fear we have
      but little to expect from them, they were falling short of Provision and mention that they
      would be obliged to return, which at this Time is particularly unfortunate; as if they chose a
      proper station, all the Vessells coming down that River must fall into their hands. The
      plague, trouble and vexation I have had with the Crews of all the armed Vessels is
      inexpressible; I do believe there is not on Earth a more disorderly set; every time they come
      into Port, we hear of nothing but mutinous Complaints Manley's success has lately and but
      lately quitted his People the Crews of the Washington and Harrison have Actually deserted
      them, so that I have been under the necessity of ordering the Agent to lay the latter up and
      get hands for the other on the best Terms he could. </P>
   <P>The House of Representative and the Honr. Board have sent me a vote of theirs relative to the
      Harbour of Cape Cod, copy of which you have herewith, I shall send an Officer thither to
      examine what can be done for its defence, tho' I do not think I shall be able to give them
      such Assistance as may be requisite, for I have at present neither Men Powder or Cannon to
      spare. </P>
   <P>The great want of Powder is what the attention of Congress should be particularly applied to.
      I dare not attempt any thing offensive, let the temptation or advantage be ever so great, as I
      have not more of that most essential Article that will be absolutely necessary to defend our
      Lines, should the Enemy attempt to Attack them. . . . </P>
   <P>They are Arming one of the Transports in Boston with which they mean to decoy some of our
      Vessels, as we are apprized of their design, I hope they will be disappointed. </P>

   <P><name>His Excellency</name> thinks that the Ship Concord &amp; Cargo[e] should be a prize, as the Enemy

      thinks it expedient to send to Congress for their determination, for which purpose an Express

      day, that Reprizals should be made; But not thinking himself authorized to declare vessels
      taken, transporting Goods from English or British owners for their Agents here, lawful
      captures, he has thought it expedient to refer the matter to the determination of Congress,
      for which purpose an Express is to set out with every necessary letter &amp; paper [that] were

   <P>Dear sir </P>
   <P>I recd your Favour of the 5th of Novr &amp; the Enquiries relative to Vessels suitable to be
      armed, Commanders &amp; Seamen to man the same, secure places for building new Vessels of
      Force &amp;care important in their Nature, &amp; to have the same effectually answered I
      propose to submit them as soon as may be to the Court that a Committee may be raised for
      obtaining the Facts from the Maritime Towns-</P>
   <P>I congratulate You on the Success of the Continental privateers which have lately brot in one
      of the ministerial store Ships &amp; several other prizes of which You will doubtless have a
      List from the General. a privateer is fitting out by Private persons at New Port to mount 14
      Guns &amp; I hope soon to give an Accpunt of several by this Government &amp; many more by
      Individuals. the late Act &amp; Resolve for fitting out armed Vessels in this Colony, I
      apprehend will have a good Effect, having already animated the Inhabitants of the Seaports who
      were unable to command much property, to write in Companies of twenty or thirty Men &amp; go
      out in Boats of 8 or 10 Tons Burthen which they call &quot;Spider Catchers&quot; - One of
      these the last Week brat in two prizes, the last of which was a Vessell of 100 Tons burthen
      from <name>Nova Scotia</name> loaded with potatoes &amp; 8 or 10 head of Cattle. two Days since I was at
      Marblehead &amp; the Lively prepared for a Decoy appeared about two Leagues off &amp; so
      deceived one of the Continental Commanders then in the Harbour that he put to Sea after her.
      One of the Spider Catchers like a brave Fellow gave likewise Chace to the Frigate, &amp; by
      the Time they had got within Reach of her Guns they found their Mistake &amp; were obliged to
      make Use of their Heels whilst the Ship with a Cloud of Sail pursued &amp; pelted them; they
      did Run with great Dexterity &amp; like Heroes escaped - . . . </P>
   <P>P.S. By Mr Sullivan from Middeford We are just informed that another Store Ship is carryed
      into portsmouth; 2 he Came thro' that Town so that there is little Reason to doubt it -</P>

      from <name>Nova Scotia</name>. </P>
   <P>Boston Gazette, MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1775 </P>
   <P>Watertown, December 4.</P>
   <P>Yesterday se'nnight [November 26] a large ship being near the Light off <name>Cape Ann</name> was struck
      with lightning, which set her on fire, and burnt to the water's edge, 'till she sunk. A number
      of cannon were heard to go off, [while] she was on fire, and 'twas thought [first that she was
      Jat least a 20 [gun]ship; but we have an account from Boston, that it was the Juno [sic
      Jupiter] transport ship from London, laden only with hay for Burgoyne's heavy horse at Boston,
      which will [soon become] light, if forage fails at this rate. - [At the same time] a sloop
      being [near her, laden with wood] and Hay [bound also] for Boston, was likewise struck with
      lightning, which so disabled her, that she put into the [gurnet,J where our people went and
      took possession of her and carried her into Plymouth - One Hall master of the sloop.1</P>
   <P>The beginning of last week, Capt. <name>Manley of the Lee Privateer</name>, came athwart a brig directly
      from the Tower of London, bound for Boston, laden with Ordnance stores, which he took and
      carried into <name>Cape Ann</name>. The inventory of which we have not seen, bnt learn it consisted of one
      13 inch mortar, upwards of 2000 stands of arms, a large quantity of musket-ball, bombs and
      carcasses fill'd shells, and a great number of empty cartridges. Several waggon loads of the
      above stores, together with the mortar (which may be call'd the Congress) were bro't to
      Cambridge on Friday and Saturday last.2 </P>
   <P>1. The sloop Britannia, <name>Josepth Hall</name>, master, as well as the Jupiter, was from <name>Nova Scotia</name>,

   <P>[Boston] 4 [December].</P>
   <P>The Admiral wrote again Today to the same Officer 2 inclosing a Letter for Captain [Henry]
      Bellow (or Officer commanding the Kings Ships) at Virginia, to inform him of the foremcntioned
      naval Equipments of the Rebels at Philadelphia, the certainty of their hastening to equip
      more, and the confident Report of their Design to attack his Majesty's Vessels and Sloops to
      the Southward; bidding him therefore be upon his Guard, and keep the Kings Ships together
      until the Admiral could send him a Reinforcement. This Letter was under a flying Seal that
      Capt: Parker might be apprized of its Contents, who was directed to forward it by the
      Charlotte, ordering her to return and receive his Dispatches.</P>
   <P>At the same time the Admiral acquainted Captain Vandeput likewise by Letter with this
      Intelligence, with the foregoing News from Canada, his consequent Resolution to detain the
      Asia in America, and with the Directions he had given to Captain Parker.</P>
   <P>The Charlotte directly sailed to the Southward with these Advices. The Hinchinbrook came up to
      Boston Yesterday from a Cruize. And late last Night all the Dispatches from the Admiral for
      England were carried aboard the Boyne, with Directions for her going forthwith to Plymouth,
      and carrying several Land Officers: The Admiral however had ordered 200 Barrels of Gunpowder,
      some of her Boats, and other Naval, and some Ordnance Stores to be left behind: her Marines,
      by Admiralty Order, were wholely landed at Boston, notwithstanding the Ships at that time were
      many short of their Complement. </P>

   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> 4 December 1775 </P>
   <P>The Savage is returned to Halifax with the Amity Transport having on board 83 Seamen raised at
      Newfoundland by order of Rear Admiral [Robert] Duff, upon my application to him of which I
      informed you by Letter dated 6th of September. <name>Commodore Arbuthnot</name> has kept the Savage at
      Halifax and sent the Transport with part of the Men to Boston. The Fowey has the
      Remainder.</P>
   <P>If a Bounty could have been given Mr Duff informs me many more would have entered, however
      these are a very good set of Men.</P>
   <P>The Ship Glasgow with 255 Emigrants from Scotland, consigned to a Mr Buchanan [Walter &amp;
      Thomas Buchanan &amp; Co.] Merchant at New York, arriving there the latter end of October,
      Captain Vandeput in pursuance of my Orders has sent her to Boston, where she arrived a few
      days ago. Whatever may be their pretext for leaving Great Britain it surely can never be right
      to continue peopling a Country in absolute Rebellion against us. Most of the Men will I
      believe enlist in the Army, and upon consulting with General Howe, we are of opinion the rest
      should be landed at Halifax, where a Provision is made by Government for their immediate
      Subsistance. </P>
   <P>As their own Victuals are expended I am under the necessity of supplying them till they can
      get to Halifax, for which purpose I have ordered the Naval Officer to muster them, and I shall
      order them to be furnished with as much provision as is requisite for the Voyage according to
      the allowance in the King's Service; and I hope this will meet their Lordship's Approbation. </P>
   <P>I must intreat their Lordships will be pleased to direct the Commissioners of the victualing
      to send out Candles and Coals for the Squadron to be supplied to the Pursers as was done last
      War to the Ships in the Western Squadron, Basque Road &amp;c. Ever since April last the prices
      of Wood, Candles and Coals have been gradually increasing, so that Wood is here five times,
      and Candles upwards of three times, dearer than usual, and Coals in proportion, though often
      not to be had: this occasions great distress among the Pursers, and in the Ships who are but
      slenderly provided with these necessary Articles. I cannot therefore avoid representing the
      peculiar Hardships the Pursers here labour under from the amazing Discount upon Bills; and
      doubt not when the whole is properly laid before their Lordships they will obtain Relief. I am

   <P><name>Preston Boston</name> Decr 4, 1775, </P>
   <P>By the Sloop General Gage who left Quebec the 9th of November, and arrived the 2d instant at
      Night, I received a Letter from Captain [John] Hamilton of his Majs Ship Lizard, containing
      very disagreeable Intelligence, of which I think proper to send you a Copy, exactly as
      represented to me: as I have not the least doubt of the Rebels attempting to take Possession
      of the Province of <name>Nova Scotia</name>, and seizing and destroying Halifax Yard this Winter or very
      early in the Spring, the Somerset cannot go home this year, but must remain with the Roebuck
      for the protection of that Arsenal, until we can collect a greater Force there. It is
      extremely unfortunate that none of the Frigates are yet arrived at Boston, many of the Ships
      with me requiring to be careened and refitted, and some of them to be sent home; but such is
      our Situation that it is impossible at present to part with one of them, except the Boyne, who
      draws too much Water for this Harbour, and at this Season I cannot think of sending her to any
      other part of the Continent. </P>
   <P>I have this moment received Letters from Captain Wallace at Rhode Island, where I find there
      is a Body of 500 Men voted to be kept in constant Pay, these upon an Alarm to be supported by
      Minute Men about the Country; the whole supposed to be about 1000 or 1500 Men, with some
      pieces of Cannon; their head Quarters about two Miles from the Town. The Inhabitants have
      tried every method to get these Troops removed from the Island, but have only obtained Orders
      for their not coming nearer the Town, and for the Towns People to supply the Kings Ships with
      every thing they want. Captain Wallace is satisfied 'tis not in their Power to remove the
      Troops, who, it appears from many circumstances wish us to destroy the Town. Hostilities
      therefore are suspended against the Town only, and the Market boats are permitted to pass,
      otherwise the Ships could not be supplied. Captain Wallace says there is certain Intelligence
      of a Frigate of 36 Guns and two of 20 being at Philadelphia and that they purpose attacking
      the Kings Ships at Rhode Island, then to go down and attack the Ships and Lord Dunmore at
      Virginia; I dont imagine they will attempt all this, but they appear extremely desirous of
      doing something by Sea, as well as by La{id. The News Papers herewith transmitted contain very
      essential Information. It is evident from their making it Felony for any one to correspond
      with the Kings Subjects and other Laws, that they are reducing themselves to Form, with
      incredible Dispatch, and meditate the most determined resistance. The Attack on Canada and the
      Perfidy of the Canadians, who I am credibly informed carried the Cannon of the Rebels down the
      Rapids, leave no room to doubt their having many Friends in that Province; it is said the
      Canadians were not a little influenced in the part they have taken by the Catholicks from
      Maryland. </P>
   <P>The Tempestuous Weather we have lately had ruins all the Ships cruizing on the Coast at this
      Season. It is however necessary to keep Ships out, though at a great risque, in order to
      protect the Transports, Victualers, Storeships and other Vessels coming with Supplies: but,
      notwithstanding our utmost Endeavours to the contrary, I fear the <name>Nancy Brig</name> laden with
      Ordnance Stores is taken. It is reported she was carried into <name>Cape Anne</name>. </P>
   <P>It is much to be lamented that a Cargo of such Consequence should be sent from England in a
      Vessel destitute of Arms even to protect her from a Row Boat. An Officer with a Party of Men
      on board would have saved the Vessel. I beg humbly to propose that all Ordnance Stores should
      come out in good Ships of Force well appointed, and constantly have an Officer on board; for
      the Ignorance and Obstinacy of Masters of Merchant Ships in disobeying Signals will ever
      prevent a Convoy keeping together, and too often they part by design, which I greatly fear has
      been the Case of this Brig, and that the Pilot (who I hear is an American) has either betrayed
      the Master or enticed him to go in with the promise of great Rewards. </P>
   <P>Their Lordships well know the Situation of this Coast in the Winter, the prevailing Winds SE
      and NW, hard Gales each way, and with the former thick Weather, Rain, Snow, and Ice, without a
      friendly Port to push for except Boston, the Entrance of which is narrow and dangerous; In
      this Situation our Cruizers without Exception have been greatly harrassed to prevent being
      wrecked qr blown off the Coast. However their Lordships may be assured that whatever is
      possible shall be done. </P>
   <P>The Cerberus's false Keel we find to be athwart, and as it cannot be remedied here I shall
      send her soon to Halifax. </P>
   <P>I have dispatched the Charlotte with Orders to detain the Asia, and have directed Captain
      Parker, if both Ships cannot lie at New York this Winter, to send the Asia or go himself to
      Virginia, which shall be found best for the Service. </P>
   <P>As the intended Reinforcements are not yet arrived and there is great Reason to imagine they
      will be blown off, I hope their Lordships will approve my not sending the Somerset and Asia to
      England this Fall. </P>
   <P>The Hope Schooner upon a Survey being taken on her, is found to be rotten and unfit for any
      further Service; I have therefore taken the Brig Sea Nymph, one of those seized for the King,2
      and am now fitting her for an armed Brig, and shall give her to Lieutenant [George] Dawson as
      a Reward for his great Diligence, Activity and Zeal for the Kings Service. I intended
      particularly to recommend him to their Lordships if he had gone home, but although his private
      Affairs press his Return to England yet at this time he prefers Serving to every other
      consideration. I can assure their Lordships the preservation of the Glasgow last Winter was
      entirely owing to his determined and Officer-like Conduct. The Brig Sea Nymph (now.called the
      Hope) was built at Philadelphia for a Pacquet, is a remarkable good going Vessel: I beg their
      Lordships to allow her fifty Men to her Complement, at present I shall establish her like
      other Brigs with 30, and lend her Supernumeraries until I hear their pleasure concerning her.

   <P>Boston December. 4, 1775</P>
   <P>Last night the Armed <name>Sloop Gage</name> returned from Quebec wch place she left the 8th of November,
      and Confirms the Rebel Accot of <name>St Johns</name> &amp; Chamblie being taken, &amp; that it was thought
      at Quebec that Montreal must likewise fall into their hands, and that nothing was to be
      Expected from the Canadiens. General Carleton was to be in town from Montreal the 11th, When
      it was Expected he wou'd be able to muster about 1500 English Inhabitants, who wou'd Garrison
      Quebec &amp; endeavour to defend it, the Master further says, that Just as he Sailed he saw a
      large body of the Rebels drawn up at Point Levie,2 but as an Express was to Sail for England
      in a day or two, you will have the particulars before you receive this. thus all our Sanguin
      hopes from Canada are over -</P>
   <P>The two Companys of Artillery, and four Companys of the 17th Regiment, are all as yet arrived
      of the troops from home; We have been these three weeks under great Anxiety for the Arrival of
      a Brig with three Morters wi[th] Shels and other Ordnance Stores; she has been in the Bay, and
      in Company with 2 or 3 different Men of War, and parted from them in the Severe Weather we
      have had; the Rebels have heard of her, &amp; sent out Vessels to take her, and Genel
      Washington has offered a reward of Ten thousand Pounds to the Crew of any Vessel that brings
      her in, to any of their Ports. 3 She wou'd be a great acquisition to him, as it wou'd Enable
      him to make our Winter Quarters two hot for us. They have several privateers that take our
      Vessels dayly, coming with Supplys, in sight of the Flag; the day before yesterday, a Vessel
      with Wood from Halifax, was taken in sight of the Men of War lying in Nantasket Road. the
      White flag at the fore top Mast head, is Old, Durty, and unfit for Service, if the Ministry
      Expects it shou'd fly with Luster they must send a New One Clean and Ferm - 4</P>

      possible, to get the Brigte 2 to Sea next Day, which with the assistance of my good Friend Mr
      Spooner I happily Effected - After Repairing on board the Brig, Saturday night, inquiring into
      the cause of the uneasiness among the people, &amp; finding it principally owing to their want
      of Cloathing, &amp; after Supplying them with what they wanted, the whole Crew to a man gave
      three Cheers &amp; declard their readiness to go to Sea next morning. The warm weather at that
      time &amp; the news of Capt Manlys good success had a very happy Influence on the minds of the

      himself is much upon the Reserve; but by the best Accounts he is Nephew to the Dutchess of
      Chandois [Chandos] and a very near Relation of Earl [of] Stanhope. He is at present confined
      in One of the best Rooms in our Gaol under a Guard. I should think it best for the Congress to
      erect a suitable Place in the interior Part of the Country for the Confinement of Prisoners of

   <P>[New York, December 4]</P>
   <P>The Council met on the 4 Decr-</P>
   <P>The Business first broke respected the public Records. The Governor had already caused such as
      affected the Crown to be brought on Board Ship from the Secretary's Office as he said upon
      Intimation that Captain Sears had formed a Design of carrying them into New England as a
      Pledge for or to compel the Fidelity of this Province in the great [Continental] Association
      and he put the Question concerning the Removal of the Rest with strong Assurances, that all
      should remain sealed be accessible only to the Secretary &amp; when the Danger was over be
      safely restored to the Colony. I was struck at this Information and instantly remonstrated
      against the Removal of any more of the Papers, declaring it was my Opinion that if any Man was
      hurt by the Loss of the Records the Authors of the Removal would be answerable in Damages and
      might be ruined. The Council adopted my opinion but would not concur with another Part of my
      Advice which was that the Mayor should be apprized of Sears's Design that Care might be taken
      of the Records in Time by the Magistrates if they should think fit to interpose . . . </P>
   <P>Mr. Tryon now informed us that he intended to acquaint the Public with his Design to return to
      England and that he had prepared a Paper for that Purpose giving Leave to propose Alterations.
      The Clerk read it. <name>De Lancey</name> said it would neither serve King nor Country [<name>John Harris</name>] Cruger
      wondered any Good could be expected from it - The Govr. said it would do no Harm as the old
      Dutchess of Marlborough used to tell her Groom on his Neglect to put her old Mares to cover on
      his objecting their Age. Oliver [Delancey] grew testy as over-ruled - I promised nothing
      certainly from it disliking the Alterations he had made 2 - It was copied and brought on Shore
      by the Clerk of the Council in a Letter to the Mayor and by him printed 3 . . .</P>

   <P>Sir,</P>
   <P>4th Dec. 1775.</P>
   <P>I desire you will lay before the Corporation the inclosed Paper, containing my Sentiments on
      the present convulsed State of this Country, and that you will please to make the same public.
      I am, [&amp;c.] </P>
   <P><name>Wm. Tryon</name>. </P>
   <P>To the Inhabitants of New-York. </P>
   <P>I Take this public Manner to signify to the Inhabitants of this Province, that his Majesty has
      been graciously pleased to grant me his Royal Permission, to withdraw from my Government; and
      at the same Time to assure them, of my R-eadiness to perform every Service in my Power, to
      promote the common Felicity. </P>
   <P>If I am excluded from every Hope of being any Way instrumental towards the re-establishment of
      that Harmony, at present interrupted, between Great-Britain and her Colonies, I expect soon to
      be obliged to avail myself of His Majesty's Indulgence. </P>
   <P>It has given me great Pain, to view the Colony committed to my Care, in such a turbulent
      State, as not to have afforded me, since my Arrival, any Prospect of being able to take the
      dispassionate an? deliberate Voice of its Inhabitants, in a constitutional Manner, upon the
      Resolution of Parliament, for composing the present Ferments in this Province: A Resolution
      that was intended for the basis of an Accommodation, and if candidly considered, in a Way
      which it will be most probably Successful, and treated with that Delicacy and Decency,
      requisite to the Cultivation of a sincere Reconciliation and Friendship, might yet be
      improved, for the Purpose of restoring the general Tranquility and Security of the Empire. </P>
   <P>I owe it to my Affection to this Colony, to declare my Wish, that some Measure may be speedily
      adopted for this Purpose; as I feel an extreme Degree of Anxiety, in being Witness to the
      growing Calamities of this Country, without the Power to alleviate them. - Calamities that
      must increase, while so many of the Inhabitants withhold their Allegiance from their
      Sovereign, and their Obedience to the Parent Country, by whose Power and Patronage they have
      hitherto been sustained and protected. </P>

   <P>The Committee appointed on the state of Virginia, to whom were referred the letters received
      on Saturday, brought in a report which was read, on which the Congress came to the following
      resolutions:</P>
   <P>Resolved, That three companies of the battalions raised in the colony of Pensylvania,
      immediately march under the command of lieutenant colonel [James] Irvine, into Northampton
      county, in Virginia, for the protection of the Association in those. parts, and for the
      defence thereof against the designs of the enemies of America.</P>
   <P>Resolved, That it be and it is hereby recommended to the Inhabitants of the colony of
      Virginia, to resist to the utmost the arbitrary government intended to be established therein,
      by their Governor Lord Dunmore, as manifestly appears by the whole tenor of his Lordship's
      conduct for some months past.</P>
   <P>Whereas Lord Dunmore, by his proclamation lately published, has declared his intention to
      execute martial law, thereby tearing up the foundations of civil authority and government
      within the said colony: </P>
   <P>Resolved, Therefore, that if the convention of Virginia should find it necessary to establish
      a form of government in that colony, it be recommended to that Convention to call a full and
      free representation of the people, and that the said representatives, if they think it
      necessary, establish such form of government as in their judgment will best produce the
      happiness of the people, and most effectually secure peace and good order in the colony,
      during the continuance of the present dispute between Great Britain and these colonies.</P>
   <P>Resolved, That the Committee on the state of Virginia have leave, at their request, to sit
      again. </P>

   <P>We acknowledge the Receipt of your Letter of the 27th Novemr wrote by Order of your Committee
      upon the Subject of Permitts for Shipping Provisions to New England; In Reply to which we
      observe, that the New England Colonies stand constantly in need of Supplies of Bread, Flour
      &amp; Corn from your Country, more especially the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay, where the
      Continental Army are now fixed. The Exportation of the Articles before mentioned ought to be
      under a very strict Regulation to prevent any Misapplication of what may be intended for our
      Friends there: We submit it to your Consideration, whether it would not be adviseable to
      require either a Certificate from some Committees of Inspection in those Governments, and
      where such Certificate cannot be con~ veniently obtained, and the People applying for such
      Permitts are Residents of New England, or of your Colony to require the Shipper or the Master
      of the Vessell in which the Provisions are to be exported, to give Bond, that they shall be
      landed or delivered to our Friends in those Governments, and to Oblige the Master to make
      Oath, that he will use his best Endeavours, that they shall be so landed and delivered We are

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Great Bridge, Dec. 4, 1775</P>
   <P>Since I wrote you, which was about two days ago, we have been well informed that we killed 16
      negroes and S white men the first day we got to this place. The next day, lieutenant [Thomas]
      Tibbs, who had the command of the boat guard, about 5 miles from this place, was attacke.d by
      a party of the king's troops, and several negroes, upon which some of our people gave ground;
      but <name>mr. Tibbs</name>, with 4 of his people, maintained his post until I reinforced him with 50 men
      under capt. [George] Nicholas, who were obliged to pass through a very heavy fire from the
      enemy. Before they got to the place, <name>mr. Tibbs</name> had beat off the enemy, and killed 7 of their
      men, amongst whom was the commander of the party.</P>
   <P>We still keep up a pretty heavy fire between us, from light to light. We have only lost two
      men; and about half an hour ago one of our people was shot through the arm, which broke the
      bone near his hand. </P>
   <P>Last night was the first of my pulling off my clothes for 12 nights successively. Believe me,
      my good friend, I never was so fatigued with duty in my whole life; but I set little value
      upon my health, when put in competition with my duty to my country, and the glorious cause we
      are engaged in. </P>
   <P>The Carolina forces are joining us. One company came in yesterday, and we expect 8 or 900 of
      them by to-morrow, or next day at farthest, with several pieces of artillery, and plenty of
      ammunition and other warlike stores. - A gun fired - I must stop. </P>
   <P>P.S. Since I finished my letter, we saw a large pile of buildings at the far end of this town
      all in flames, between which and the fort we had 4 sentinels, who can give no account how it
      happened. As I mentioned above, the fire was discovered when the gun fired; and by the time
      the men got paraded a volley of small arms was fired from the fort, mixed with now and then a
      cannon shot. About 11 at night it ceased for about half an hour, when, to our great surprise,
      we saw several other houses in a blaze, which are just now consumed. It is now 10 o'clock. I
      shall lie down till the next alarm. </P>

   <P>Sir - It is necessary to apprize you, that Capt. [Edward] Thornbrough has fitted the scooner
      Polly (late Capt. Stone's) with a number of swivel guns, and manned her with a design to take
      your vessel, and Capt. Smith's. You will avail yourselves of this notification - and while you
      cruise, which at this time you ought to do with great diligence, for the benefit of our
      friends, be extremely guarded against falling into the snare of the enemy. Perhaps a stratagem

   <P>Sir -</P>
   <P>Your letter of the 25th November brought to this board in the recess of [the Provincial]
      Congress, a paper containing &quot;Articles of agreement for the suspension of hostilities
      between the enemies of liberty on their part, yourself and Major [James] Mayson on our part,
      done at Ninety-Six, the 22d of said month ... &quot; </P>
   <P>Major Robinson's messenger, or a person who pretends to be the messenger, and calls himself
      Floyd, has appeared before us, and declared that being drunk, he had lost all his papers at
      Orangeburg. He was nevertheless extremely anxious to go on board the vessel in which Lord
      William [Campbell] keeps his court, in order to inform his Lordship verbally all that he can
      recollect of the contents of the treaty and relative circumstances. As this man brought with

      those who persevere in acting unjustly and cruelly towards us, we have consented that he shall
      go to Lord William, upon this express condition, that his whole conversation with his lordship
      shall be in the presence and hearing of a witness whom we shall send for that purpose - this
      will be no more than equal to unsealed dispatches covenanted for in the 4th article </P>

   <P>Holland House Decr 5th near the Heights of Abraham.</P>
   <P>My Dear General,</P>
   <P>I have been this Evening favoured with yours of the 19th ult and return you many Thanks for
      your warm Congratulations. Nothing shall be wanting on my Part to reap the Advantage of our
      good Fortune. The Season has proved so favourable as to enable Me to join Col. Arnold at Point
      Aux Trembles, where I arrived with the Vessels Mr Prescot made us a Present of. They carried
      the few Troops about 300 which were equipped for a Winter Campaign with the Artillery &amp;c
      Col. Livingston is on his Way with some Part of his Regiment of Canadians. </P>
   <P>Mr Carleton who is I. suppose ashamed to Shew himself in England is now in Town, and puts on
      the Shew of Defence. The Works of Quebec are extremely extensive and very incapable of being
      def ended. His Garrison consists of McClean's Banditti, the Sailors from the Frigates and
      other Vessels laid up together with the Citizens obliged to take up Arms, most of whom are
      impatient of the Fatigues of a Seige, and wish to see Matters accommodated amicably. propose
      amusing Mr Carlton with a formal Attack, erecting Batteries, &amp;ca but mean to insult the
      Works, I believe towards the lower Town which is the weakest Part. I have this Day written to
      Mr Carlton, and also to the Inhabitants which I hope will have some Effect. I shall be very
      sorry to be reduced to this Mode of Attack, because I know the melancholy Consequences; but
      the approaching Severe Season, and the Weakness of the Garrison together, with the Nature of
      the Works, point it out too strong to be passed by. </P>
   <P>I find Col. Arnold's Corps an exceeding fine one, inured to Fatigue, &amp; well accustomed to
      Cannon Shot (at Cambridge). There is a Style of Discipline among them much superiour to what I
      have been used to see this Campaign. He himself is active, intelligent, and enterprizing.
      Fortune often baffles the Expectations of poor Mortals. I am not intoxicated with the Favours
      I have received at her Hands, but I do think there is a fair Prospect of Success. </P>
   <P>The Governor has been so kind as to send out of Town many of our Friends who refused to do
      military Duty, among them several very intelligent Men capable of doing me considerable
      Service. One of them a Mr Antel [<name>Edward Antill</name>] I have appointed Chief Engineer Mr Mott &amp;
      all his Suit having returned home. </P>
   <P>Be so good as to shew Congress the Necessity I was under of cloathing the Troops to induce
      them to stay &amp; undertake this Service at such an inclement Season. I think had their
      Committee been with me, they would have seen the Propriety of grasping at every Circumstance
      in my Power to induce them to engage again. I was not without my Apprehensions of not only
      being unable to make my Appearance here, but even of being obliged to relinquish the Ground I
      had gained. However I hope the Cloathing &amp; Dollar Bounty will not greatly exceed the
      Bounty offered by Congress. </P>
   <P>Whilst the Affair of Chamblee was in Agitation, Major Brown, as I am well informed, made some
      Promises to the Canadians who engaged on that Service, which I believe, I must from Motives of
      Policy as well as Justice make good - viz to share the Stores, excepting Ammunition &amp;
      Artillery - When Matters are settled I shall pay them in Money, it being inconvenient to part
      with the Provisions. </P>
   <P>Upon another Occasion also I have ventured to go beyond the Letter of the Law. Col. Easton's
      Detachment at the Mouth of the Sorrel was employed on the important Service of stopping the
      Fle~t. They were half naked, and the Weather was very severe. I was afraid that not only they
      might grow impatient and relinquish the Business in Hand, but I also saw the Reluctance of the
      Troops at Montreal shewed to quit it. By way of Stimulant, I offered as a Reward all public
      Stores taken in the Vessels, to the Troops who went forward, Except Ammunition and Provisions.
      [Seth] Warner's Corps refused to march, or at least declined it. [Timothy] Bedel's went on and
      came in for a Share of the Labour &amp; Honour. I hope the Congress will not think this Money
      laid out. </P>
   <P>With a Year's cloathing of the 7th &amp; 26th I have relieved the Distresses of Arnold's
      Corps, and forwarded the Cloathing of some other Corps. The greatest Part of that Cloathing is
      a fair Prize, except such as immediately belonged to Prisoners taken on Board. They must be
      paid for theirs as it was their own Property. We shall have more Time hereafter to settle this
      Affair. </P>
   <P>Should there be any Reason to apprehend an Effort next Spring to regain Canada, I would not
      wish to see less than Ten Thousand Men ordered here. The Canadians will be our Friends as long
      as we are able to maintain our Ground, but they must not be depended upon, especially for
      defensive Operations. The great Distance from any Support or Relief renders it in my opinion,
      absolutely necessary, to make the most formidable Preparations for the Security of this
      important Province, What Advantages the Country below Quebec affords for Defence, I cannot yet
      assert, but the Rapids of Richlieu some Miles above may be defended agt all the Navy and all
      the military Force of Great Britain by such a Body of Troops as I have mentioned provided with
      sufficient Artillery Row Gallies, &amp; proper Vessels fitted for Fire Ships. </P>
   <P>Some Time since you desired a Return from General Wooster of the Men he has discharged between
      Albany &amp; Tyonderoga. I was afraid there might be something disagreeable to him in the
      Desire, &amp; as it was too critical a Time to put any Body out of Humour, I therefore
      suppressed it. I shall now make him acquainted with your Pleasure on that Head. </P>
   <P>There are several Appointments I have thought necessary to make, which I shall soon make known
      to You. I hope the Congress will not yield to any Solicitations to the Prejudice of the Troops
      who have bore the Burthen of the service here. I have paid particular Attention to
      Recommendations of Col. Arnold. Indeed, I may say, he has brought with him many pretty young
      Men. </P>
   <P>I don't know whether I informed you that it was in vain to think of engaging the Troops for
      twelve Months. The 15th of April which allows them Time to plant their Corn upon returning
      home, was all I dared to ask. I hope the proper Measures will be taken for sending fresh
      Troops into the Country before that Time. I am &amp;c </P>

   <P>My last of the 20th utimo from Point aux Trembles, advising of my retiring from before Quebec,

      Yesterday we arrived here, and are making all possible Preparation to attack the City, which
      has a wretched motley Garrison of disaffected Seamen, Marines &amp; Inhabitants, the Walls in
      a ruinous Situation &amp; cannot hold out long. Inclosed is a Return of my Detachment
      amounting to 675 Men for whom, I have received Cloathing of General Montgomery. I hope there
      will soon be provision made for paying the Soldiers Arrearages, as many of them have Families
      who are in Want. A continual Hurry has prevented my sending a Continuation of my Journal. I am

   <P>Since my last letters, by this same conveyance, We have advice by the way of Boston, that
      Montreal is in the hands of the Rebels, that they were assisted by the Canadians in this
      attempt, and supplied by them with Provisions; I have only to add, that Canada being in the
      hands of the Rebels, will deprive t~ Province of every resourse for supplying the Army, Navy,
      and the Inhabitants of this Colony with Bread; and the only supplies of Provision are to be
      had from Great-Britain, and Ireland, and your Lordship will be convinc'd of the Rectitude of
      the Measure of sending the quantity of Provision, to arrive here early in the Spring; which
      will be the safest time, and Vessels have arriv'd here the beginning of March. </P>
   <P>My Reason for urging this Measure, is, that the Americans have fitted out Vessels of War, and
      have lately been cruising in these Seas, and intercepted sev eral Vessels, bound from Europe
      to Boston, two Arm'd Schooners were for some time in the Harbour of Canso, and carried of [f]
      several Vessels belonging to this Province, whose Crews landed on the Island of <name>St John</name>'s, and
      carried off Mr Colebuck [Callbeck] the Commander in Chief of that Island, and several Officers
      of Government; and I hear a twenty Gun Ship from Philadelphia has been Cruising in the mouth
      of <name>St Lawrence</name> Gulph between Cape Breton and Newfoundland. 2</P>
   <P>In Consequence of these Hostile Invasions, I have by the Advice of His Majestys Council,
      proclaimed <name>Martial Law</name>, as I Judged it was necessary to put the whole Province in Military
      Array to repel these Invaders, a Copy of which Proclamation is herewith Inclos'd. </P>
   <P>Brigadier General [Eyre] Massey is arrived after a long passage of Sixty one days: the other

      the Severe Season is so far advanced, they will not be able to succeed, and should that be the
      Case, I hope they will be able to make this Port, which is open at all Seasons. I have the

      this Province, and particularly of late, two Armed Vessels have appear'd off Canso, where they
      have daringly seiz'd and taken a Schooner belonging to that Port. To the intent therefore that
      all, and such like proceedings may in future be prevented, the Persons and properties of his
      Majesty's faithfull and loyal Subjects within this Province, be render'd secure; and that all
      Aiders, Abettors, and Correspondencers with Rebels, in Arms against his Majesty's Government,
      may more effectually, and speedily be convicted and brought to condign Punishment, for such
      atrocious and treasonable Crimes. </P>

   <P>Tuesday Evening</P>
   <P>Dear sir</P>
   <P>I waited on General Washington Saturday Morning last [December 2] &amp; prayed him to furnish
      me with [a few] pieces of Cannon to help hoist the number I [intend] for the Privateer we
      intend fixing, the Plan pleased him but he assured me it was not then in his Power to assist
      me since which I have several Times conversed with General Gates on the Subject &amp; this
      Afternoon he promised that the Vessell should be compleated furnished with Cannon in abt 18 or
      20 Days if I am not disappointed in this, nothing can prevent my going on with the Plan of
      arming the Schooner as I mentioned to you last Saturday - Therefore would be glad you would
      inform me By the Bearer wether it would be agreeable to you to take about a sixth or an eighth
      Part of the Schooner - 2 </P>
   <P>The amount of the Cost of the Vessell, arming &amp; fixing of her compleately with 12 or 14 6
      &amp; 4 Pounders with 4 2 Pounders, &amp; a number of Swivells, 6 Months Provisions will
      amount by the best Calculations we are able to make to £2000 <name>Lawfull Money</name>, chargeing every
      Article of the Expence at a most extravagant rate - the Persons concerned are Mr [Jonathan]
      Jackson, Mr <name>John Tracy</name>, &amp; Mr <name>Jos Lee</name>, Capt <name>Wm Wyer</name> (a very clever Fellow &amp; who will do
      extremely well for the Captain) &amp; myself. we all wish you would join us for many Reasons
      If General Gates should disappoint us, I shall send immediately to Rhodeisland to procure the
      Cannon there - &amp; hope the Vessel will be ready to sail in a Month I wish to have an
      oppertunity of conversing with you on this Subject, but have some perticular Business to do
      with Colo. Glover this Evening which prevents my waiting on you &amp; I must be at home by 12
      oClock to Morrow - pray what kinds of Restrictions will the Council Lay upon the Commissions
      of Privateers &amp; what Amount will the [Bond be] taken for-</P>
   <P>what are the common Customs &amp; Regulations for Privateers as to shares?- </P>
   <P>as conveniences for writing at the Camp are extreme[ly] [bad], I hope you will Excuse the
      Inacureatness of [thi]s Letter - the bearer will wait your Answer - I am [&amp;c.] </P>

   <P>2. The sales catalogue extract which President <name>Franklin D. Roosevelt</name> acquired with the letter
      states that it relates to the &quot;Yankee Hera,&quot; the first privateer of the Revolution.
      However, it was not the first, nor is it likely that the vessel referred to in the letter
      became the Yankee Hero, as the latter was a brig, not a schooner. The Yankee Hero was not
      commissioned until January 13, 1776, and Massachusetts had privateers at sea during December
      1775. At the same time, it is clear that the group of which <name>Nathaniel Tracy</name> was a part sent
      the Yankee Hero to sea. Thus, it would seem that the statement in the sales catalogue is not
      entirely in error since the efforts described did lead to the sailing of the Yankee Hero. </P>

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Watertown, Decr. 5th, 1775</P>
   <P>Our Privateers more than answer our Expectations. since the Grand Prize I wrote Mr. [John]
      Adams of several other vessels have been taken, perticularly one from Scotland dunnaged with
      Coal and filled up with Bail Goods to a very Considerable Amount and Consigned to James
      Anderson, who by the way is become a Captain in Gorham's Regiment of Fensible Americans. it is
      said another Vessel with dry Goods for Canada is also taken and one with Fish from the Land.
      this Success Confirms the Sentiments I have long had. Fifteen privateers fixed out last June
      would before this have put an End to the War, or at least have Obliged the Fleet and Army to
      leave Boston.2 </P>
   <P>1. Warren-Adams Letters, II, 427-429. </P>
   <P>2. Adams supplied extracts of this letter to the publishers of the Pennsylvania Journal, which
      were printed Wednesday, December 13, 1775, as follows: &quot;Several prizes have been taken
      since my last - One from Scotland, dunnaged with coal, and filled up with bale goods,
      consigned to <name>James Anderson</name> a Scotch merchant in Boston - The foot of the invoice is about
      3600 sterling: - It is said another vessel is also taken, with dry goods from [sic] Canada;
      and another with fish from Newfoundland. - This success confirms the sentiments I have long
      had - Fifteen armed vessels, fitted out last June, would have before this time put an end to
      the war, or at least obliged the fleet and army to have left Boston.&quot; </P>

   <P>Watertown December 5. 1775</P>
   <P>The letter you did me the honor of writing me dated October 19th - came to hand but a few days
      past - the notice taken of me by the Committee of Congress appointed to collect an account of
      hostilities &amp;c. I own myself indebted to you for, and you may be assured that I shall do
      every thing in my power to forward that business: A Committee of both Houses of which I am one
      has been appointed in consequence of the Committee of Congress[es] letter being laid before
      them, and a circular letter is to be forwarded to the Selectmen &amp; Committees of
      Correspondence in the several towns where hostilities have been committed, that we may be able
      to furnish your Committee, with a collected account of the damages sustained in those towns. </P>
   <P>Is a sea coast of above 2000 Miles extent from whence two hundred sail of Privateers might
      this winter by the way of foreign ports at least, be launched out upon the British trade,
      still [to] be held in a state of neutrality under a notion that we are opposing Ministry &amp;
      not the People of Britain, while our enemies are employing the whole force of the Nation to
      plunder and ruin us - If the Congress remain silent on this head, will they take it amiss if a
      Colony, the first in suffering as well as exertions, should grant letters of Reprisal to those
      Persons only who have had their property seized &amp; destroyed by the Enemy. I some time ago
      ventured a prophesy, that it would not be long before we realized our importance as a Maritim
      power, and the success attending our first Naval enterprises, are very encouraging presages of
      what is yet to come - but if weak nerves and large estates should opperate to the preventing
      the whole force of the Colonies being exerted against the common enemy, the issue of so
      unequal &amp; unheard of a war, may be easily augur'd. </P>

   <P>I have had the pleasure to receive your Letter Novr 7. notifying to me your Arrival in his
      Majs Ship Roebuck at Halifax in Quality of Resident Commissioner there, and also with a
      Commission appointing you Commander in Chief of his Majs Ships in Halifax Harbour in the
      Absence of a Flag or Senior Officer, I beg leave most sincerely to congratulate you on these
      Appointments and to express my happiness in having such an able and experienced Officer at a
      Place and upon a Service of so much importance to Great Britain. Convinced of your earnest
      desire to promote the Good of the King's Service, I cannot but approve of your sending the
      Fowey to convoy the Transport with Naval Stores to Boston, but I am concerned to find you
      think it necessary to detain the Somerset whose Arrival will be anxiously expected by the
      Admiralty, in consequence of my having acquainted them she was to sail upon your Arrival.</P>
   <P>As to the large Body of Rebels marched up the Country, they are well known to be gone to
      Canada: 2 And I believe it is equally certain that unless assisted by Canadians and Indians
      the Rebels cannot invade <name>Nova Scotia</name> with any Prospect of Success until April next; however it
      is certainly right to be on your Guard against a most deceitful and enterprizing Enemy. I beg
      to offer you any Services in my Power at Boston, and to assure you that I am with much Esteem
      and Regard. Sir [&amp;c.]</P>

      taken on board at <name>N. York</name>, baring date at Philadelphia, 15 Nov., 1775, upon which I repaired
      hear with all the dispatch in my power, therefore as it appears from said Resolution of the

      appointment of a new Master to be approved by you, and as I am the sole owner of said ship I

   <P>I arriv'd here yesterday, &amp; made preparation to go over the lake this morning but General

      a list of Stores on the other side from which I am enabled to send an Inventory of those which
      I intend to forward to Camp. The garrison at Ticonderoga is so weak, The conveyance from the
      fort to the landing is so difficult, the passage across the lake so precarious, that I am
      afraid it will be ten days at least before I can get them on this side - when they are here
      the conveyance from hence will depend entirely on the sleding - if that is good, they shall
      immediately move forward without sleding the roads are so much gullied that it will be

   <P>[Extract]</P>
   <P>Philadelphia, Decembr 5th, 1775.</P>
   <P>This Colony has now in the River fourteen armed Galleys, with near seven hundred men on board;
      2 and we are informed by their Committee of Safety, which has sat daily for the last six
      months, that their expenses have amounted to more than fifty thousand pounds, which they
      expect to bear as a Colony charge. Should they alter their opinion, the expense of our Armed
      Vessels might then be urged for, with greater propriety; indeed we consider it a probable
      method to have them paid for, to get them into Continental service, but your Honor will
      remember, that, at the time they were applied for, they were reported to be unfit for the
      Eastern service.3 The Congress are now fitting out with all possible dispatch a number of
      armed Vessels, and though the Committee have engaged the number already ordered, yet it is our
      opinion, more especially Mr. Deane's, who attends that Board, that if the Minerva shall be
      judged staunch and fit for service, that she may be employed by the Congress. Wish your Honor
      to write on this subject in your next, as the season advances, and our fleet must sail soon.
      Capt. Whipple has joined them, this day, and is taken into Continental service .... 4 </P>
   <P>The Naval Committee will be in want of seamen and marines: if therefore, the Briga in Colony
      service will, on refitting, bear a survey, and can be warranted sound and staunch for service,
      Mr. Deane thinks the Naval Committee would employ her to bring round Seamen and Stores to this
      place; but this must beresolved on immediately, as before hinted. 5 </P>
   <P>1. Collections of the Connecticut Historical Society, II, 327-332. </P>
   <P>2. The reference was to the galleys of the Pennsylvania Navy, of which there were thirteen,
      not fourteen.</P>
   <P>3. Congress had applied to Connecticut to send its armed vessels in pursuit of two unarmed
      powder brigs en route to Quebec from England. See Hancock to Trumbull, October 5, 1775.
      Trumbull reported the brig Minerva as the only vessel suitable for that service, but later
      discovered she was not in condition to proceed. See Trumbull to Hancock, October 17, 177 5. </P>
   <P>4. According to <name>Samuel Ward</name>, Whipple, in the Katy, must have arrived on the morning of
      December 3, as the captain was to dine with him that afternoon. See <name>Samuel Ward</name> to <name>Henry Ward</name>,
      December 3, 1775.</P>
   <P>5. Mr. Deane was wrong; the Naval Committee did not employ the Minerva. </P>

   <P>Your design of sending Vessells with Cargoes .to the Foreign West Indies for the Purpose of
      purchasing Arms and Ammunition, has been communicated to me by my Friend, Mr Hooe - Embolden'd
      by his Advice, and prompted by an unfeignd Affection for my Country, I would wish onthis
      Occasion to make a tender of my best Services to it, through your Honours - And to this end I
      would propose, if you consent, to go out with the Flour Mr Hooe is purchasing here for Account
      of the Province; to exchange it in the Islands for such Articles as you may Order, with which
      I would immediately dispatch the Vessells home, and then fix my Residence there in whatever
      Port you judge most proper for executing your further Commands, should you have any wherewith
      you might be pleased to entrust me.-</P>

      to consider the Hazards of the Voyage with the great Expence I must necessarily incur in the
      Negociation of you[r] Affairs, I doubt not of your allowing me a generous Commission. - If, in

   <P>Since my last, we have sent a party of 100 men, under the command of col. [Edward] Stevens, of
      the minute battalion, over the river, who fell in last night, about 12 o'clock, with a guard
      of about 30 men, chiefly negroes. They got close up to the sentinel undiscovered; the sentinel
      challenged, and was not answered, upon which he fired. Our people, being too eager, began the
      fire immediately, without orders, and kept it up very hot for near 15 minutes. We killed one,
      burnt another in the house, and took two prisoners (all blac~s) with 4 exceeding fine muskets,
      and defeated the guard. There is hardly an hour in the day, but we exchange a few shot. I am

   <P>In the Council of Safety, [Charleston] Dec. 5th, 1775. </P>
   <P>Upon an application by Col. [George Gabriel] Powell, on account of the armed brigantine
      Comet:</P>
   <P>Ordered,That Capt. <name>Robert Cochran</name> do deliver to the order of Col. Powell, two pieces of

      proportion. </P>
   <P>Ordered,That the secretary do acquaint Col. Powell, that all amounts against the public, must
      be laid before the board, attested. </P>
   <P>The secretary, from the commissioners of observation, reported, that application had be.en
      made to him, to give a permit for no less than five hundred pounds of fresh beef to be sent on
      board the Scorpionsloop of war lately arrived. And that Mr. <name>Fenwick Bull</name>, notary public, had
      also applied to him in behalf of Mr. <name>Thomas Inglis</name>, merchant, for a pass for the ship Betsey,
      Capt. Robins, outward-bound and declared for departure. And he requested the direction of the
      Council upon these heads: whereupon it was, </P>
   <P>Ordered,That no permit be given for any greater quantity of provisions to be supplied the
      King's ships, than is allowed by the resolution of the general committee of the 16th September
      last. And that Mr. Bull be acquainted, that his application relative to the ship Betsey,had
      been laid before them; and that they had refused for the present to take that matter under
      consideration. </P>
   <P>Resolved,That the Council of Safety do approve the Secretary's having refused a permit for the
      ship Betsey. </P>
   <P>The following instructions were given to Mr. <name>Benjamin Lewis Marchant</name>, who in behalf of the

   <P>Mr. Marchant, on. the part of the Council of Safety; is to inform Lord <name>William Campbell</name>, that
      a person by the name of Floyd, assuming to be a messenger from Major [Jaµies] Robinson, with
      dispatches to his Lordship (which he pretends to have lost,) being desirous of waiting on his
      Lordship, in order to relate to him the substance of a treaty for suspension of hostilities
      between the contracting parties, for a certain term of time, done at Ninety-Six on the 22d of
      November last - the Council of Safety have consented - upon this express condition: that the
      said Floyd shall not converse with his Lordship, nor with any other person acting under his
      Lordship, but in the presence and hearing of the person - sent on the part of the Council of
      Safety; such demand being no more than equal to open dispatches, stipulated in the 4th article
      of the treaty - which treaty Mr. Marchant may deliver to his Lordship. </P>
   <P>If his Lordship will consent to this demand, the messenger Floyd, will be permitted to
      converse with his Lordship - if denied, Mr. Marchant will attempt to insist upon returning
      immediately with Floyd, and act according to his own discretion; but not return without Floyd,
      unless peremptorily ordered and obliged to do so. </P>

   <P>PROTEST </P>
   <P>By this Public Instrument of Protest be it known and made manifest unto all whom it doth or
      may concern, That on this sixth day of December 1775, Before me, <name>John Wendell</name> of Portsmouth,
      in the Colony of New Hampshire, Esq. Notary &amp; Tabellion public admitted sworn &amp;
      registered personally appeared <name>Samuel Stacy</name> master, <name>Thomas Mead</name>, mate, <name>William Dixon</name> mariner,
      all late belonging to the Brigantine Sally, of which <name>Samuel Cutts</name> of Portsmouth Esq. was sole
      owner, who being all sworn upon the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, Solemly depose &amp;
      declare that they sailed in and with the said Brige from the Island of Tortola in the West
      Indies to Portsmouth, on the 24th day of June last, having on board Rum, Sugar and Cotton on
      Cargo, at which time the said Brig. was tight, staunch and strong, and in every Respect fitted
      for said voiage, That they sailed in Safety until Tuesday the 11th of July, When the wind
      being fresh at South West and hazy Weather at 3 o'clock, p.m. they saw a schooner bearing East
      South East, laying by; as soon as they perceived we discovered them, they made all the sail
      they could after us &amp; came up with us very fast; we tack'd ship &amp; stood to the
      southward, &amp; they made after us, &amp; then we discovered a large topsail schooner
      standing right across us, we being then in Campa with a Briga commanded by <name>John Kendricks</name>
      called the UndutiedTea, the Deponents then tack'd ship again and stood to the Northward, and
      Capt. Stacy being sick, the Deponent Mead spoke with Capt. Kendricks, who told him that he
      took these schooners to be Cutters cruising after inward bound vessels, and that he intended
      to stand close in to the land, &amp; if they followed him, he would run the vessel ashore,
      sooner than be taken by them; we soon perceived they were two Tenders belonging to the English
      Navy, and Deponents then made all possible sail for the land; abt 5 o'clock p.m. they made the
      Vineyard, the Tenders still chasing them, about 7 o'clock p.m. the water being shoal the
      Tenders were afraid to venture, &amp; stood off again, Capt. Kendrick's being so close that he
      came to an anchor, but these Deponents taking a Pilot from him, they beat off all night with
      the wind still at South West, &amp; finding the Tenders waiting for their getting off into the
      sound, they, abt 5 o'clock a.m. bore away to go thro' Marthas Vineyard and Miseket, so called,
      by which they expected to clear the Enemy; abt 8 o'clock the Brige struck upon a Shoal called
      Hoses Shoal? and there continued until 7 o'clock p.m. Just after they struck, their Brige
      sprang a leak, &amp; a Boat came from the shore to their assistance, and they attempted to
      lighten her, by throwing over the Ballast, and carried out an anchor to heave her off the
      shoal, &amp; kept both Pumps working; they having got her off, &amp; weighed the anchor made
      sail, but the wind became quite calm, and it came on thick weather, and the water rose to that
      degree, notwithstanding both Pumps going, that it overflowed the Cargo, they kept her above
      water until the morning of the next day July 12th when they were obliged to run her ashore on
      the vineyard to save their lives and what of the Cargo they could, which was 6 Bales of
      Cotton, ten Hogsheads of Rum, but lost all the Sugar; wherefore these Deponents protest
      against the said English cruisers or Tenders as the sole &amp; only cause of the said
      misfortune &amp; further these Deponents say not; and I the said Notary at the Request of
      these Deponents did &amp; do hereby protest against the said Cruisers or Tenders by whomsoever
      they may be commanded in behalf of these Deponents &amp; the Insurers, Passengers or
      Freighters, owner or Interested in the said Brigantine and her Cargo or any part thereof, for
      all costs, losses, Damages or Expences already sustained or which may hereafcer be sustained
      by these Deponents or the interested aforesaid by or on account of the said misfortune as the

   <P>The Committee, to whom the petition of Captain <name>Dougal McGregor</name> was referred; 3 brought in
      their report, which being read, was agreed to as follows, viz.</P>
   <P>Resolved, That it is the opinion of the Committee that the circumstances stated in the said
      petition will not justify a license to export the said lumber and naval stores, contrary to
      the rules of American Association. </P>
   <P>Resolved, That if the said <name>Dougal McGregor</name> will give bond, with sufficient security, in a
      penalty of double the value of the said Lumber and Naval stores, to the President of the
      provincial council of North Carolina, with condition that he will not carry the said cargo to
      Great Britain, Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, Sark, Aldernay, or Man, or any European Island or
      settlement within the British Dominions, nor to the British West Indies; and that he shall,
      within six months after exporting the same, import into Edenton, Newbern, or Bogue Inlet, in
      the colony of North Carolina; and there deliver to the commander of the continental troops in
      the said colony, such quantity of muskets, or gunpowder, as shall be equal to the value of the
      said lumber and naval stores, the public interest requires that he be permitted to export the
      same, and that a permit for that purpose, signed by the said President, be given him on his
      executing such bond as aforesaid. </P>

   <Title>A LETTER FROM PHILADELPHIA, DATED DECEMBER 6, 1775 1 </Title>
   <P>The Congress have given orders for fitting out two ships of 32 guns each, and two brigs, to
      carry from 16 to 20 guns each, and the Province one of 18 guns, 18 pounders, and to be ready
      for sea by Christmas; to be commanded by one Hopkins, who was to hoist his flag on board the
      ship called the <name>Black Prince</name>,for the protection of the river. 2 </P>
   <P>1. The Westminster Journal And London Political Miscellany, Saturday, January 13, 1776. </P>
   <P>2. The date on which the Grand Union Flag was raised on board the Alfred, formerly the Black
      Prince, has long been a matter of dispute. A letter from &quot;B. P.&quot; to the Earl of
      Dartmouth, December 20, 1775, states: &quot;the 3d instant the Continental flag on board the
      <name>Black Prince</name> opposite Philadelphia was hoisted.&quot; <name>John Paul Jones</name> in a letter to the
      president of Congress, December 7, 1779, states: &quot;It is this day four years since I had
      the honor to receive my first Commission as the Senior of the first Lieutenants in the Navy
      ... I hoisted with my own hands the Flag of Freedom the first time that it was displayed on
      board the Alfred on the Delaware.&quot; Papers CC (Letters and Papers of <name>John Paul Jones</name>),
      168, II, 107-120, NA. It is quite possible that Jones, anticipating receipt of his commission,
      might have assumed his post as First Lieutenant of the Alfred on December 3, 1775. It is
      believed that the tonnage of the Alfred was three hundred. See <name>John J. McCusker</name>, Jr.,

   <Title>&quot;EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM PHILADELPHIA, DEC. 6.&quot; 1 </Title>
   <P>We have just to hand, by express from Virginia, that Dunmore had issued a proclamation,
      declaring all Negroes and servants free that belonged to men in arms for the defence of their
      country; 2 that he had beat the Provincials in two skirmishes; the particulars are only known
      to the Congress, which we fear are not very favourable. Great numbers of people, white and
      black, had repaired to the King's standard, which he had hoisted. As there are in Norfolk many
      of his sc[oundrel]ly countrymen, English Tories, and others, no better, and thro' the country,
      in the neighbouring counties of Aromack [Accomac], Hampton, and others on the western shore,
      many gentlemen wavering, we should not wonder at their being awed to follow this Jacobite
      Scotch fortunist to their ruin. Little do they or he know what force we are preparing. All the
      Virginia and North Carolina troops are in full march against him; and for fear they may not be
      able to follow these vagabonds, traitors to their country, from river to river, as he may
      proceed with the assistance of his vessels, we are fitting out here a number of ships with the
      greatest expedition to attack him; they will sail, or at least fall down the river in a few
      days, viz. The <name>Black Prince</name>, a fine vessel, I believe you know her well, she carries a flag,3
      and mounts from twenty to thirty twelve and sixteen pounders, besides swivels, and fights them
      mostly under deck. Two stout, fast sailing brigs, a sixteen gun sloop, just arrived from Rhode
      Island, with one or two other ships not yet in commission; the Admiral and Commanders are all
      determined on, but not publickly known. Other ships will join our fleet in Cheropeak
      [Chesapeake] Bay, from Baltimore town. . . . there is but little doubt of our united forces
      soon giving a good account of Dunmore, which we pray most ardently for. We have nothing to
      fear but from the Asia, a sixty gun ship, lying at New York, that the Captain may have
      information of the destination of our fleet, and endeavour to interrupt them at our Capes.
      Hell itself could not have vomited any thing more black than his design of emancipating our
      slaves; and unless he is cut off before he is reinforced, we know not how far the contagion
      may spread. . . . Though we look on ourselves quite safe here. Our frigates, and our fort,
      which is a regular one, on Mud Island, was planned, and partly executed by [Thomas] Gage's
      Engineer, Capt. Montresure [<name>John Montresor</name>]. Our ballast vessels and <name>Chevaux de Frise</name>, at the
      narrows and flats, will be very sufficient to defeat any ship that may attempt to annoy us. </P>

      indentured servants who would join him. </P>

   <P>Philadelphia 6th Decr 1775 </P>
   <P>Dear Sir </P>
   <P>The inclosed letter from Colo [Edmund] Pendleton came to hand two days ago, and as it will
      save a good deal of unneccessary writing, I send it to you. The proclamation there alluded to,
      we have seen. It proclaims martial law thro Virginia and offers freedom to all the Slaves,
      calling their Masters rebels &amp;c - It seems this unlucky triumph over [Joseph] Hutchings
      with his less than half armed Militia, so dispirited the miserable wretches in that
      neighborhood, that many have taken an oath of Ld Dunmores prescribing, reprobating Congress
      Committees &amp;c - Long before this, <name>Colo Woodford</name> with 800 good men, must be arrived in
      those parts, and I make no doubt has forced his Lordship on board his Ships again. All this
      would have been prevented, if our troops could have crossed James,River in proper time, but
      they were obstructed &amp; forced to march high up by the Men of War, and indeed, such is the
      nature of our water intersected Country, that a small number of men provided with Naval force,
      can harrass us extremely. I have good reason to hope, that in a few weeks, the state of things
      in Virginia will be greatly altered for the better. I thank you for your list of Armed
      Vessels, but at present no use can be made of them. I hope some of them will be fortunate
      enough to meet with prizes eastward. </P>

   <Title>LORD DUNMORE TO LORD DARTMOUTH 1</Title>
   <P>(No 34) </P>
   <P>On Board the Ship Dunmore off Norfolk Virginia 6th December 1775</P>
   <P><name>My Lord</name> Since my letter (No 33) in which I informed your Lordship that Mr Mitchel the
      Collector of the Lower district of <name>James River</name> had made his Escape to this place, Mr Bradley
      the Comptroller has done the same, but Mr [Archibald] Cary the Na val Officer has accepted of
      the Command of the Rebels at Hampton, and now Acts as such there. I have as I informed your
      Lordship I would, appointed one in his place, and Captain [Edward] Foy is the person I have
      pitched upon, but he being now in England I have procured a proper person to Act for him in
      his absence, I hope Captain Fay's former Services in Germany, as well as those he has rendered
      his Country here, will ensure him this <name>Mark of His Majesty</name>'s favour, I think at the same time
      my own Services gives me Sufficient reason to expect that my recommendation should have some
      Weight. </P>
   <P>On the 27th of October some of the King's Tenders went pretty Close into Hampton Road, so soon
      as the Rebels perseived them they marched out against them, and the moment they got within
      Shot of our People Mr <name>George Nicholas</name>, Lord North's late Comptroller of the upper district of
      <name>James River</name>, who commanded the party of Rebels at that time at Hampton, fired at one of the
      Tenders, whoes example was followed by his whole party, the Tenders returned the fire but
      without the least effect, but next day the Tenders returned again to the Creek, and ran up
      very near to the Town, the Rebels being reinforced, and taking possession of the Houses, made
      a very heavy fire upon them, but only killed one or two of the men, and wounded several
      others, took a Pilot Boat, that the Gentlemen of the Navy had made a Tender of, and made Seven
      Men prisoners, belonging to the Otter that were in her, the loss of the Rebels must have been
      very inconsiderable if they suffered at all, the Tenders were towed out of the Creek by the
      boats with some difficulty. _These overt Acts of Rebellion determined me to Issue the inclosed
      Proclamation, (No 1) which however I postponed as long as possible, in hopes of having
      Instructions from your Lordship for my Conduct, in this as well as in many other matters I
      have so often prayed to be instructed in, for many Months past, but not one line have I had
      the Honor to receive from your Lordship since yours of the 30th of May. God only knows what I
      have suffered since my first embarking, from my anxiety of mind, not knowing how to act in
      innumerable instances that occur every day, being one moment deffident of my own judgement
      (and not having one liveing Soul to advise with) and then on the other hand fearing if I
      remained a Tame Spectator and permitted the Rebels to proceed without any interuption, that
      they would by persuasion, threats, and every other art in their power, delude many of His
      Majesty's well disposed Subjects to their party, then again it occurred to me that should I be
      able to prevail on only a few to espowse His Majesty's Cause (with the very small force I had
      to support them) I should only involve them in inevitable ruin, should the Rebels march a body
      against us that we were not able to withstand, in this Situation was my mind when I was
      informed that a hundred and twenty or thirty North Carolina Rebels had marched into this
      Colony, to a place Called the Great Bridge, about Ten Miles from hence, and a very Strong
      Post, in order to join some of ours assembled not far from thence, this I was determined not
      to Suffer, I accordingly embarked in the Night in boats, with all of the 14th Regiment that
      were able to do Duty, to the amount of 109 Rank and file, with 22 Volunteers from Norfolk, the
      Carolina People had fled the Evening before, but hearing at the Bridge that there were between
      three and four hundred of our Rebels Assembled at a place called Kemps landing, Nine or Ten
      Miles from the Bridge, I was then determined to disperse them if possible, we accordingly
      Marched thither immediately, and about a Mile from the place our advanced party were fired
      upon by the Rebels, from a thicket, before our People discovered them, I immediately ordered
      the main Body, who were within two or three hundred paces to advance, and then detached a
      party with the Volunteers to outflank them, at the same time the advanced Guard with the
      Grenadiers rushed into the Woods, the Rebels fled on all quarters, we pursued them above a
      Mile, four or five were killed, a good many wounded and Eighteen taken Prisoners on that and
      the following day, a more particular Account of this is in the inclosed <name>Virginia Gazette</name>, (No
      2) which is the first of our publishing, the good effects of this most trifeling Success was
      manifested strongly by the Zeal which the People shewed on this occasion to His Majesty's
      Service when unawed by the opposite party, I was immediately determined to run all risques for
      their support, and on that very day ordered the inclosed Proclamation to be published, erected
      the Kings Standered (Alias a pair of Colours as I had no better) and the next day, I suppose
      not less than a hundred of those very Men who were forced into the field against me the day
      before, came and took the inclosed Oath (No 3) (which I drew up for the occasion:) Your
      Lordship may observe that about three thousand have taken that Oath, but of this Number not
      above three or four hundred at most are in any degree capable of bearing Arms, and the
      greatest part of these hardly ever made use of the Gun, but I hope a Short time (if they are
      willing) will make them as good if not better than those who are come down to oppose them; the
      Numbers of the Rebels now on their March, are uncertain; the Bridge abovementioned is by
      Nature a very Strong Pass, and the only one by which they can enter Princess Anne County by
      land, and a great part of Norfolk County, I immediately ordered a Fort to be erected there,
      and put an Officer with 25 of the 14th Regiment to Garrison it, with about as many Volunteers,
      and about Fifty Negroes, whom I now Arm and discipline as fast as they come in; the Fort has
      been beseiged by between Seven or eight hundred of the Rebels for these eight days past,
      without hitherto doing us the least damage, except wounding one or two Men very Slightly; by
      the best Ac.counts I have been able to procure, the Rebels must have lost from 15 to 20
      killed; they have made many attempts to Cross the Branch on Rafts, but thank God we have
      hitherto always repulsed them. </P>
   <P>I am now endeavouring to raise two Regiments, one of White People (Called the Queens own Loyal
      Virginia Regiment) the other of Negroes [(]Called Lord Dunmores Ethiopian Regiment.) </P>
   <P>I wrote to your Lordship in one of my former Letters that I had taken Ships into His Majesty's
      Service, as also Sloops and Schooners as Tenders, all of which I am now Arming as well as I
      can; So your Lordship sees I am equiping a fleet, raising an Army and all this without any
      order from your Lordship, or any other person, but if I have done wrong the blame must not be
      laid at my door, I have prayed and intreated your Lordship over and over again for
      Instructions, but not one Syllable from your Lordship for these Six Months past. </P>

   <Title>JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COUNCIL OF SAFETY 1</Title>
   <P>In the Council of Safety [Charleston], Wednesday, Dec. 6th, 1775. </P>
   <P>Mr. <name>John Ash</name> informed the Council, that some boats from the British ships of war in
      Rebellion-Road, had yesterday sounded and staked the Creek, leading to the place of his
      residence. </P>
   <P>Mr. Benj. <name>L. Marchant</name>, who yesterday had attended <name>Matthew Floyd</name> on board the Cherokeearmed
      ship, to be present at the interview and conversation that should there pass between said
      Floyd and the Rt. Hon. Lord <name>William Campbell</name>, attended the Council, and reported as follows: </P>
   <P>Upon my going on board the Cherokee,I inquired for Lord <name>William Campbell</name>; I was answered by
      the Master, Mr. Picard, that his Lordship would be on board presently, and invited to walk
      down, which I declined. Lord William soon after came from Sullivan's Island, accompanied by
      Mr. [Alexander] Innes and Mr. Trail. After saluting my Lord, I delivered the m_essage, and
      presented him with the treaty. Lord William then went down into the cabin, and Floyd was sent
      for; whereupon, I immediately desired to speak with his Lordship, who answered 'pre~ently ;'
      and in a few minutes I was desired to walk down; when I repeated to his Excellency, that in
      consequence of the message I had delivered from the Council, I hoped, I should be present at
      all the conversation that should pass between Floyd and his Lordship. Here Mr. Innes demanded,
      what was the message? I again repea.ted to him, as nearly as I could, what Mr. [Peter] Timothy
      had delivered to me on a small piece of paper. Mr. Innes then read the 4th article of the
      treaty, and asked, who are you? I answer~d, a private person, entrusted with that message from
      the Council of Safety. The following questions and answers ensued: </P>
   <P>Innes. Do they intend to deliver up [Robert] Cunningham?</P>
   <P>Ans. I dont know.</P>
   <P>Innes. Are you one of them? </P>
   <P>Ans. No.</P>
   <P>Innes. Are you only a messenger for them? </P>
   <P>Ans. Yes. </P>
   <P>Innes. I thought Calvert was their messenger? </P>
   <P>Ans. So he is, but they have sent me upon this particular business.</P>
   <P>Innes. And do you think my Lord will treat with them? </P>
   <P>Ans. Yes, sir.</P>
   <P>Mr. Innes then addressed himself to Lord <name>Wm. Campbell</name>, and said, 'then my Lord, there must be
      no conversation;' and withdrew, calling his Lordship after him. Lord William soon returned and
      said to me, 'he must detain me a little; that he was sorry he was obliged to do many things
      contrary to his inclination - that it was hard not to be supplied with necessaries - and now,
      even <name>Lady William</name> was denied to come down.' And Mr. Innes went on board the Scorpion. By this
      time, Floyd complained that he was sick, and went upon deck; I immediately followed him, and
      remained there until Mr. Innes returned. Mr. Innes upon his return, went down instantly; the
      boat was ordered and Lord William came upon deck, telling me, that he must detain me a little
      longer; then he also went on board the Scorpion. After his Lordship had left the ship,. the
      surgeon gave Floyd and 'myself an invitation to walk down and drink somewhat - but before we
      had drank, Floyd was sent for by Mr. Innes, who was then alone in the cabin. I remained a few
      minutes with the surgeon, then went upon deck. In the mean time Capt. Ferguson had gone down,
      who sent me an invitation which I accepted, and I remained in the cabin, with him, Mr. Innes
      and Floyd until Lord William returned (with Mr. Trail) from on board the Scorpionabout seven
      o'clock at night, or later - when his Lordship came along-side, we all went upon deck. His
      Excellency immediately went down - Mr. Innes followed-and presently Mr. Innes returned,
      say'ing to me, 'my Lord desires you will return, and inform the persons who sent you, that as
      the other person is a messenger from a friend to government, he must detain him until he had
      determined on a proper answer.' </P>
   <P>Mr. Marchant also reported, that while he was on board the Cherokee, four pieces of cannon,
      six-pounders, with Bermuda marked on the carriages, were brought on board from the
      transport-ship. </P>
   <P>Ordered,That the Secretary do immediately write to Captain <name>Arnoldus Vanderhorst</name>, to endeavour
      to apprehend and seize <name>Matthew Floyd</name> aforementioned, if he should be landed and appear in
      Christ-Church Parish. </P>
   <P>The following letter was accordingly written:</P>
   <P>Charles-Town, Dec. 6th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Sir - The Council of Safety thinking it absolutely necessary, that every endeavour should be
      used, to apprehend one <name>Matthew Floyd</name>, who may be landed from the men of war, to proceed into
      the back'country by the way of Christ-Church Parish, and Wappetaw-Bridge; and knowing your
      zeal and diligence in the public service, they have ordered me to signify their desire, that
      you will use every endeavour to apprehend him; and that you. will place-proper persons at
      proper places for that purpose. I have the honour to be, sir [&amp;c.]</P>
   <P>Capt. <name>A. Vanderhorst</name>. <name>Peter Timothy</name>, Secretary. </P>
   <P>Ordered,That Mr. Butcher, in whose care <name>Matthew Floyd</name> left his horse, do attend this board
      immediately. </P>
   <P>Mr. Butcher attending accordingly - was ordered not to deliver the said horse to any person
      whatsoever that should call for him; but to seize such person, and forthwith give notice
      thereof, either to Mr. President or the Secretary, or the Council, if then sitting; and not to
      disclose the present order to any one. </P>
   <P>Capt. <name>Joseph Darrel</name> acquainted the Council, that one of the Bermuda sloops seized by the men
      of war in Rebellion-Road yesterday, seemed to be fitting out, and intended for sea. </P>
   <P>Ordered, That Capt. Darrel do forthwith apprize Capt. Vesey thereof, and to be on his
      guard.</P>
   <P>On motion.</P>
   <P>Resolved,That it is expedient and necessary, that the two thousand pounds of gun-powder
      brought from Georgia, and placed under the care of the committee at Beaufort, should be
      forthwith removed from thence and brought to Charles-Town.</P>
   <P>Ordered,That the said gun-powder be forthwith removed accordingly. </P>

   <P>The Case of <name>Phillip Callbeck</name> late commander in Chief of the Island <name>St John</name> and <name>Thomas Wright</name>
      one of the Council, Justice of the peace, and Surveyor General of said Island: - Addressed to
      <name>His Excellency</name> General Washington-</P>
   <P>That on Friday the 17th of November two armed Schooners or Privateers arrived at Charlotte
      Town the Capital of the said Island, immediately after Captain Broughton and Selmon who
      commanded said Vessels landed with two parties under their command; - That Mr Call beck met
      Captain Selmon on his landing, who notwithstanding a very Civil reception immediately order'd
      him on board his Vessel without permitting him to return to his House though requested so to
      do. - That as he was going on board one of the party insultingly without any provocation
      struck him. - That immediately after Mr Calbeck was conveyed on board he received a messuage
      from Captain Salmon to send the Keys of his house Stores &amp;c otherways he would break the
      Doors open - on the receipt of this messuage Mr Callbeck instantly sent the Keys with one of
      his Clerks (who was detained a prisoner) that he might attend and opeh the doors of such
      places as the Captains choose to inspect, upon the Clerks informing him of Mr Callbecks
      directions, the Captain told him he did not want l;iis assistance, and desired him to deliver
      the Keys which he accordingly did. - That Captains Broughton and Selmon with their party
      immediately proceeded to a Store in which were a large assortment of Goods all of which except
      some Earthenw;are they sent on board Captain's Selmons Vessel after which (although they had
      the Keys of the doors) they broke open two other stores out of which they took the most
      Valuable articles together with the entire stock of provisions that Mr Callbeck had provided
      for his Familys winter support and the Inhabitants immediately about him. - After which they
      went into Mr Callbeck's dwelling house where they examined all his private papers and broke
      the Bed chamber's Closets and cellar doors open though they had all the Keys. - In Mrs
      Callbeck's bed room they broke open her drawers and Trunks scatter'd her Cloaths about read
      her Letters from her Mother and Sisters, took the Bed and window curtains, also the Bed &amp;
      bedding, and they or some of the party took <name>Mrs Callbeck</name>'s Rings Bracelets Buckles and
      Trinkets, also some of their Cloaths. After which they took the parlour window Curtains
      Looking Glasses Carpets and several articles of plate, and to accomplish the whole, they took
      out of Mr Callbe[ck's] cellar aH his Wine, porter, Rum, Geneva and Cordials; except one cask
      of. Wine which they stove the head in and drank the whole out - They also took <name>Mrs Callbeck</name>'s
      little stores of Vinegar Oil Candles, Fruit, sweetmeats, Hams, Bacon &amp;c.-Notwithstanding
      they having done what is here related, they next went to Mr Callbeck's Office, from which they
      took two Trunks full of Goods. - His Clerk's Desk and wearing apparelAfter which they open'd
      Mr Callbecks Bureau and Desks read all his pap[ers] some of which were of great importance in
      his private connexions. They also took the province silver Seal weight 59 ounces, Gov[ernor]
      patterson's Commission some of Mr <name>Callbecks Cloaths</name>, all his Shoes &amp;c </P>
   <P>That after they had ravaged Mr Callbecks house and out Houses, they broke into Governor
      Patterson's House (in which no person resided) out of which they took his Window curtains,
      Carpets Looking Glasses, Cases of Knives &amp; forks Silver spoons &amp;c &amp;c.-Broke some
      of the China and suffer'd their Men to drink what liquors they found in the House. - That
      after they had accompliced thus far of their Cruelty, they took Mr Wright into custody and
      brought him on bo~rd the Vessel where Mr Callbeck was confined and to keep pace with their
      barbarity Captain Selmon order'd his party to go in to take Mr Wright .from the arms of his
      Wife and Sister, and insultingly smiled at the Tears and Lamentations of Women who were in the
      greatest distress, being seperated from their Husband and Brother. - That after Mr Wright came
      on board he and Mr Callbeck represented the treatment they had received, the confidence they
      had that the Captains had no orders to commit such outrag[es] and they in order to justify
      themselves read your Excellencys instructions by which it appear'd they were not directed to
      go to the Island and that your Excellency had particularly cautioned them not to abuse private
      property; upon which Mr Callbeck wi[th] Mr Wright labour'd all in their power to convince them
      of their not having in any respect conformed to their instructions, they further represented
      the Cruelty of taking them away for. tho' it was probable they would be imediately dismissed,
      yet it would be almost impossible for them to get back to the Island before the Winter set in,
      the Season being then so far advanced, notwithstanding they determined to take Mr Callbeck
      (and his Effects) and Mr Wright - That Mr Call beck supposes they have in their custody of his
      property to the amount of two thousand pounds sterling - to exaggerate the cruel treatment he
      has rece~ved is impossible and it is equally so even to give an exact detail of the injuries
      that have been offered to him and his property - His papers all read some of which were of a
      very private nature - Notwithstanding they had all his Keys, his Doors broke open, his Effects
      taken away' the provisions and n~cessaries he had provided for his Families support taken away
      and, wantonly destroyed - His Wife left destitute of every support, also between 70 and 80
      people who were lately arrived on the Island and depended on Mr Callbeck for their support
      during the Winter will in all probabillity Starve. - By Mr Callbeck's being taken away he is
      debarred from assisting <name>Mrs Callbeck</name> who is left without any support, not so much as a Candle
      to burn beside the necessity of taking the necessary care of what remains of a shatter'd
      Fortune; what has been left of his property on the Island is in the hands of Servants who
      doubtless will be neglectfull and perhaps avail themselves under the depr[a]dations that has
      been committed on his property by alleging several of his effects which they will choose to
      plunder were taken away by the Captains - The Captains by their conduct have left Mr Callbeck
      open to these apprehensions for altho' it was urged and requested by his Clerks that an
      Inventory should be taken of the Effects the Captains took away-They would not permit it nor
      would they suffer the Clerks to stand by while they were taking the, things away, and to make
      the matter still more, doubtfull and to give the inhabitants an opportunity to plunder, the
      Captains after they apprehended Mr Wright suffer'd some-of their people to remain on Shore
      (without an Officer) who broke a second time into Governor Patterson and Mr Callbeck's Houses
      and took out of them what they pleased, and finished what LiquGrs that had been left in both
      Houses. - That during their Voyage some articles of Plat[e] and other of Mr Callbeck's
      property were found in the custody of some of the Marines, so that even upon a supposition
      that Mr Callbeck should be order'd his property, he will doubtless be a considerable looser. -
      That Mr Callbeck and Wright thus wantonly torn from their Families have been brought in a
      state of Captivity upwards of 600 Miles by Sea to this province, during their passage they
      nave suffer'd many inconveniences and since their landing they have travelled 120 miles, part

      nearly as I can give information there were seven vessels taken and sent home, all the
      particulars are not in my power - all these were released. </P>
   <P>&quot;We arrived at Beverly with these goods brought in the two vessels Broughton's and mine;
      when landed near Col. Glover's dwelling, Colbeck and Wright went to Head Quarters at Cambridge
      where they and their goods were released. This year being nearly up <name>Commodore Broughton</name> and
      myself went to Head Quarters at Cambridge to see the General - he met us on the steps of the
      door, we let his Excellency understand we had called to see him touching the Cruise he
      appeared not pleased-he wanted not to hear any thing about it and broke off abruptly to me,
      Sir says he will you stand again in Col. Glover's Regiment-my answer to him was I will not
      sir. He then accosted <name>Commodore Broughton</name>-you sir, have said you would stand; Com. Broughton
      said I wiII not stand, thus ended the matter relative to the cruise. It appears by the sequel
      that Gen'l. Washington had singular hopes that Quebeck would be taken by Gen'l. Montgomery and
      that Broughton and myself would have a prospect of intercepting those transports from Quebeck
      for England, but this was not the case.&quot; Selman to Gerry, March 18, 1813, printed in

   <P>Killingworth, 7th Dec., 1775.</P>
   <P>Dear Sir, - According to your request I wrote you sometime since respecting our machine, 2
      supposing it was gone to the eastward. On finding that on proof of the navigation one
      instrument failed performing what was expected from it I then by letter acquainted you t~e
      proceeding was delayed until that could be repaired; which when done, another proof has been
      made which answers well, and every trial made requisite to the attempt respecting navigation,
      and everything answers well, but still, he fails on one account. He proposes going in the
      night, on account 'of safety. He always depends on fox-wood, which gives light in the dark, to
      fix on the points of the needle of his compass, and in his barometer, by which he may know
      what course to steer and the depth he is under water, both which are absolute necessity for
      personal safety of the navigator; but he no&quot;Y finds that the frost wholly destroys that
      quality in that wood, of which he was before ignorant, and for that reason and that alone he
      is obliged to desist. He was detained near two months for want of money, and before he could
      obtain it the season was so far advanced he was, in the manner I have now related, frustrated.
      I write you this with two views, first that you and those to whom you may have communicated
      what I wrote, may not think I have imposed upon you an idle story, and in the next place to
      have you enquire of Dr. Franklin wr he knows of any kind of phosphorus which will give light
      in the dark and not consume the air. He has tried a candle, but that destroys the air so fast
      he cannot remain under water long enough to effect the thing. This you may rely upon, he has
      made every requisite experiment in proof of the machine, and it answers expectations; what I
      mentioned above is only wanting. . . . </P>
   <P>The person, the inventor of this machine, now makes all his affairs a secret even to his best
      friends, and I have liberty to communicate this much from him only with a view to know if Dr.
      Franklin knows of any kind of phosphorus that will answer his purpose; otherwise the execution
      must be omitted until next spring, after the frosts are past. I am therefore to request your
      strictest silence in that matter. I am Sir, your humble servant </P>

   <P>Fort Constitution, Decr. 7th, 1775.</P>
   <P>We have been down in the sloop Liberty, examining the river as low as Slaughter's Landing, and
      find the depth of water, from there to this post, greatly to exceed the information we had
      had. We also took a view of Pooploop's kill, and found its situation the best by much for any
      defensive works in the Highlands. A little to the north of the house on the hill, is a place
      where a battery of heavy cannon would obstruct an enemy's coming up, as it commands the river,
      down and up, the length of point blank shot. Timber in plenty near, to be had. No enemy can
      land at Haverstraw, and cross the mountains to annoy i~ by land. The height of the place,
      about one hundred feet above the river, and is not miich wider over to Anthony's Nose than at
      this post. From Pcioploop's kill, we understand there is a tolerable road, and can be made
      with ease much better, to the West Point; from there, an enemy might bring cannon by land
      against this post. We beg you will be pleased to lay the.above before the Honourable

   <P>Mr President laid before the Council the following copies of letters which he had dispatched
      this morning, by <name>George Dittinger</name>: </P>
   <P>Charles-Town, Dec. 6th, 1775.</P>
   <P>Gentlemen-Having received information, that through sickness of some and absence of other
      members of your board, the intended repairs at Fort Lytleton are scarcely yet begun; and
      knowing the necessity for putting that place in the best state of defence without further
      delay, we have judged it necessary, and have accordingly resolved, that Col. <name>Stephen Bull</name>,
      Thos. Rutledge, and Nath'l Barnwell, esqs., be added to your present number, which we desire
      you will immediately notify to those gentlemen, and summon a board in order to expedite the
      work above mentioned, and to carry into execution such other matters as we shall hereafter
      recommend. </P>
   <P>The Scorpion sloop of war lately arrived in Rebellion-Road, having under her commf1nd a large
      transport ship, has been at Bermuda, and at Cape-Fear, from each place she. brought off all
      the cannon that could be taken, and we learn that Capt. Tollemache has orders to seize the
      cannon wherever he can in all the colonies; no doubt therefore, but that Beaufort will be the
      next visited, and we are the more apprehensive of this from a seizure of two Bermuda sloops,
      which was made yesterday by the commodore, one of which has hoisted a pendant, from whence we
      conclude she is put in commission. From these and other considerations, we recommend that
      without a ~inute's delay you cause all the cannon belonging to the fort or town, to be secured
      by removing them to a distance out of the reach of a man of war's guns and under the
      protection of a proper body of militia, or even by burying them, if the enemy suddenly
      approach. The King's ships which are at present among us, have no men to spare for enterprizes
      on land, but if they can work under the protection of their own, they will certainly carry off
      your cannon. </P>
   <P>We also recommend, that you proceed with all possible dispatch to repair the fort 'according
      to the plan first adopted by the late Council of Safety, by which the platform was to have
      been of pine plank, which will certainly be most expeditiously performed and expedition is
      aboslutely necessary; you will erect platforms and mount gun after gun, as you shall be in
      readiness, two or three or even one of your heaviest cannon, we apprehend may be fired to such
      advantage as will deter a tr&lt;l;nsport vessel, or even the Scorpion,whose cannon are very
      light, from attempting to , advance. Powder for immediate use in case of need must be had from
      the six hundred pounds lodged in the hands of the committee at Beaufort, and we hope that
      before you have mounted all of your cannon, we shall receive such supplies as will enable us
      to lay in a proper magazine for the fort's use. By order of the Council of Safety. </P>

   <P>Gentlemen - You are directed to use every means in your power effectually to prevent the
      loading of vessels in your port, and within your district, with rice, indigo or other produce
      of this colony, intended for any port or ports, out of the limits thereof, without special
      permission in writing from the Council of Safety, or the [Provincial] Congress, and
      particularly you are to see that no vessel even with a permit on any pretence whatever, clear
      out for any port of Great Britain, Ireland, or any of the British West-Indies, the contrary
      being expressly ordered by the Continental Congress at Philadelphia, who have refused to
      suffer even such vessels as they have permitted to load to clear out at any of the
      custom-houses.</P>

      Philadelphia for permission to clear out vessels for Great Britain, in order the more
      effectually, as you said, to execute the commission of shipping off the produce of this colony
      for continental service, and that such permission was peremptorily refused. We have therefore
      reflected upon your application for the same purpose to this board, and although we did not
      grant your request as being out of our department, we think it necessary to add, to such
      observations as were then made, our desire and injunction, that you will not attempt to clear
      out any vessel for Great Britain, Ireland, or the British West-Indies. </P>
   <P>By order of the Council of Safety. </P>

      among the former; Robinson who has the\care of the post-house on Sulliv.an's Island, and among
      the latter, one Swan, a mulatto; both whom he declared he perfectly knew. </P>

      considerable sum of money, belonging to them, out of the sloop Thomas and Stafford, Solomon
