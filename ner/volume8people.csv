Abraham -RSB- Whipple	PERSON	had just got onboard her with a number of Men We immediately came to Sail , and run down with the Sloop , I did it chiefly to see what Situation the Ship was in , and when we got down found the Diamond ashore on a Shoal which runs off S.W. from Patience about half a mile from that
Shott	PERSON	of the Diamond __ : the Wind blowing so hard is I think the Reason of her not coming to Sail-The truth is the Ships could not have got down and if the Wind had not blow 'd so hard and they could it would not have been prudent in my Judgement , neither Should I have Order 'd them down as the Enemy 's Ships could have come to
Sail	PERSON	with any Wind that we could and a great deal better as they Lay in a wide Channel , and we in a narrow and very Crooked one - So much for the Ships not going down Now it remains to give you an Account of our proceedings after we got down in the Sloop - I went ashore at Warwicl < - saw Colonel
Bowen	PERSON	who told me he had Sent for two eighteen pounders , and in less than half an hour they came - I went onboard the Sloop and we drop 'd down under the Ships Stern a little more than Musket
Shott	PERSON	off it being then a little after
Sun Sett	PERSON	- We fired from the Sloop a number of
Shott	PERSON	which she return 'd from her Stern Chacers - the Ship Careen 'd at Dusk about as much as she would have done had she been under Sail After they had fired from the Shore about twenty Six
Shott	PERSON	they Ceased , and soon after Hailed the Sloop and said they wanted to Speak with me - I went ashore and was inform 'd they were out of Ammunition I offer 'd them Powder and Stuff for Wads but we had no
Shott	PERSON	that would do - they sent to
Shott	PERSON	and I went onboard the Sloop and sent some Junk ashore for Wads - Soon after they hail 'd again from the Shore , and I went to See what they wanted , and gave
Captn Whipple	PERSON	Orders not to fire much more as I thot it would do but little Execution it being night and could not take good Aim with the Guns - When I got ashore the Officer that Commanded there desir 'd that I would let them have some Bread out of the Sloop which I sent the Boat off for , but the people not making the Boat well fast while they were getting the Bread She drifted away and I could not get onboard again - The Ship by Lightening got off about 2 OClock the same Night - and on the whole as the Ship was on a Flat almost under Cover of a 50 Gun Ship and got off again before it was possible to have done anything with the Frigates I thought it of no moment untill I saw your Letter to our

Cabot	PERSON	, standing to the S. E. the
Cabot	PERSON	's lee quarter , bearing from N. to
N. N. W.	PERSON	and standing on the same tack with them : That the wind blowing fresh , the two brigs a-head reefed their topsails , and tacked to the

Cabot	PERSON	to escape , had Capt.
Olney	PERSON	forgot his promise to the other two Captains on the preceding evening ; but he , desirous of yielding every assistance in his power to his companions , tacked ship and stood after the enemy , hoping that wind and weather would afford them an opportunity of engaging her with their united strength .

Ashurst	PERSON	and
Serjeant Davy	PERSON	opened for the prosecution , and in a very full manner stated the nature of the evidence about to be adduced , in support of the charge .
Baldwin	PERSON	, was next sworn ; and in the course of his evidence , which was extremely long , it came out , that by the direction of Lord Temple he had repeatedly visited the prisoner , while in the
John Fielding	PERSON	in Bow-street ; till the 15th of February , on which last day he unbosomed himself fully , and owned that he had set the rope-house on fire on the 7th of
Decemher	PERSON	, and told him every circumstance relative to the matter , beginning with his first proposing the measure to Mr.
Silas Deane	PERSON	at
Silas Deane	PERSON	-RRB- in order to prevent a discovery in case of his being apprehended ; his interview with the merchant on his arrival in town , his vexation and disappointment at the merchant 's refusing to credit what he said , his informing him that he had fired the Dock-yard at Ports - · mouth , his accompanying him to a Coffee0
Baldwin	PERSON	's testimony was not invention , a great variety of witnesses were sworn , who corroborated the whole of his testimony , each confirming a part of his information .
Justin	PERSON	,
James Axsan	PERSON	, at any time within one month from the 13th of November 1776 , to leave the
Baron Hotham	PERSON	-RRB- called upon the prisoner to make his defence .
Baldwin	PERSON	to feign the story he had told , and collect a parcel of witnesses to support it in the manner they had done that day ; and if
Baldwin	PERSON	had told the truth , he asked whether in that case he ought to be credited , as it was clear he had been guilty of a breach of confidence ; and if he had the art to deceive him by lies , was it not also likely that he would play false with others , and impose on a Jury ?
Baron Hotham	PERSON	was more than an hour in summing up the evidence , which he recited with great precision , and made his observations as they occurred , both for and against the prisoner : he told the Jury , they were to consider only the fact , and how far the evidence went to prove it ; but that they ought to divest themselves entirely of prejudice , and not in the least to advert to the horrible consequ ~ nces which might have issued from the conflagration .
Baron Hotham	PERSON	immediately , in the most solemn manner , passed judgment upon him , sentencing him to be hanged by the neck till he should be dead , and warning him in a strain , equally humane and awful , to prepare himself for eternity , into which he would be launched in a few days , his crime being of that enormous nature , that he must not expect mercy .
Baldwin	PERSON	, and when that witness came to mention
Silas Deane	PERSON	, he bid him beware and not perjure himself , for that there was a righteous God above , who dealt out righteous judgments , in whose presence he , the witness , and the whole Court then stood .
Serjeant Davy	PERSON	, and appealed to the Court whether a question put by Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	ought to be put ?

WILLIAM BINGHAM	PERSON	TO THE AMERICAN COMMISSIONERS IN FRANCE -LSB- Extract -RSB- St
Pierre Mque May	PERSON	19th 1777 ... The Subject which I alluded to in my last , is in regard to the Sale of our Produce , which the French Merchants at present absolutely refuse to purchase for the European Market ; as many of their Vessels have been already visited , & American Produce which has been found therein , taken out & confiscated .
SKEFFINGTON	PERSON	LUTWIDGE , R.N. , TO CAPTAIN
PHILEMON POWNOLL	PERSON	, R.N. My dear friend Point au fer 20th May 1777 I am not favour 'd with your Letter of the 12th till to day , & have the satisfaction of receiving at the same time a very polite Letter from
Genl Burgoyne	PERSON	who is pleased to express great pleasure in my nomination to the Naval Department - The command I am intrusted with is as you say heterogenous , neither is the footing it is put upon of much consequence , being only temporary - whether last Year 's Orders were pocketed intentionally or not I do n't know , but I doubt much whether
Capt Douglas	PERSON	or any one of the fleet knew that the Articles of War are by a subsequent Act , extended to the Lakes in
Ticonderago	PERSON	, as you desire my Sentiments upon the Subject , I must freely tell you I never had an Idea of the kind , excepting that after the taking of that place , it shou 'd be necessary immediately to transport the Gun Boats & c to get possession of
George -RSB- Tmnbull	PERSON	's not coming up , is rather a disappointment , not only from the want I shou 'd have of him , but also from my hopes that it might have been of service to him - his attendance at the Court Martial I was aware of , & possibly he may yet be up in time , for embarkations are tedious - by the last Accounts we have , there are not now 2000 Men at Ti , and the whole Country in the greatest confusion if the Fleet was up at
Batteaux	PERSON	& c & c & c there is Tonnage more than sufficient for carrying them all up to
Howe	PERSON	& the
Admty	PERSON	also of my situation , & motives for accepting a temporary Command upon the Lakes - if you think it proper , I beg you will take the trouble of sending a Copy of a Letter from me to you on the subject , but it appears to me unnecessary - I know the Commdr of the Proteus well & wish he was safe arrived for many reasons I ca n't tell you what makes Mrs. J. melancholy , therefore do n't know how to prescribe - at midnight she is always in Spirits & I fear you leave her too early - my Compts to her ,

NATHANIEL BATEMAN	PERSON	May 1777 Cape Nichola SBW 8 or 9 Leagues Tuesday 20th at 3 AM spoke with two large French Ships from
Briggs	PERSON	, the Southermost of them answered the description of an American privateer , we had Intelligence of , we stood for her and fire 'd a Shot accross her , when she was -RRB- n Reach to bring her too , She hoisted some Colours which being behind her Mainsail , not spreading out we could never desern what they were , on our firing another Shot she hauled down her Colours and began to make what sail she could , let the Reefs out of her Topsails , and took the Tampeons out of her Guns , as we came along side her Observed She was prepared for Action ; shortened Sail and ordered her to do the same , & bring too , instead of complying , she shot ahead , attempting to cross our forefoot , and get close under our weather bow , which oblidged us to put the helm hard aweather to clear her , this brought her on our weather MAY 1777 1005 quarter , She then bore away under our Stern , made more sail , and keep ' t pointing her guns , with other Manuvers , which Indicated a design to Rake us , and attempt to escape , or to attack our Prize , which was then on our lee quarter , at this time the other Brigg which had carried Spanish colours , had hauled them down , and brought too at some distance to windward of us , when we fired the second Shot at the nearest suddenly made all the sail she could , and haulled her wind on our weather bow , as they had Corresponded by Signals , & acted in concert ; the Spanish Colours which had been carried by one of them appeared only as a deception , and their attempting to escape by different Routs confirmed that oppinion , therefore fire 'd at them both till they short -LSB- e -RSB- ned sail , and brought too , sent the Boat onboard & found the first had no Commission onboard , altho the Spanish Commander said he was a
Sail	PERSON	, and
