James Tracy	PERSON	was late commander ; as her engagement with the
Printer	PERSON	give the following narrative of it , chiefly collected from those who were in the engagement .
James Tracy	PERSON	sailed from
Cape Ann	PERSON	he observed a sail in the Offing , but in his situation did not think of looking after her : Two boats full manned with their musquets , who had put out after the sail came on board , and informed him a number of transports had been close in with the
Tracy	PERSON	who intended to make a har - bor that night , ordered the brig to be put a8bout for the shore not then sus - pecting the ship could come up with him ; but he had not tacked 10 minutes before the Westerly wind died away , and the ship taking a fresh southerly breeze came fast in , endeavouring to cut the brig off from the shore : After some time the ship thus getting in the wake of the brig , the wind again came fresh to the westward upon which ` the brig hawled to the wind in the best angle for the shore ; the ship gave chase , and in an hour came up within half a mile and began to fire her bow chasers which the brig only answered with a swivel , Capt.
Tracy	PERSON	reserving his whole fire , until the ship , keeping a con - stant fire , came up within pistol shot upon his lee quarter , when the brig gave her the best return they could make from their main and quarter deck guns , swivels , and small arms , and after then , kept up a constant fire : The ship was soon up along side , and with 12 nine pounders of a side , upon one deck , besides forecastle and quarter deck guns , and with her marines , over - looking the brig as high ' as .
Tracy	PERSON	was unable to fight his lee guns , upon this he backed under her stern , but ` the ship which sailed much faster , and worked as quick , had the advantage and brought her broadside again upon him , which he could not evade ; and in this manner they lay not a hundred feet from each other , yawing to and fro , tor an hoiir and twenty minutes , the pri - vateers men valiantly maintaining their quarters against such a superior force .
Tracy	PERSON	tacked under her stern , and when clear of the smoak and fire , perceived his rigging to be most shockingly cut , yards flying about without braces , some of his principal sails shot to rags and half his men to appear - ance dying , and wounded - Mr.
Main	PERSON	, his first lieut. was among the first wounded , and Mr.
Davis	PERSON	one of the Prize Masters , fell in the last attack .
Tracy	PERSON	to have recourse to his guns again , though he still kept some hands aloft to his rigging , but before the brig had again fired two broadsides , capt.
Tracy	PERSON	received a wound in his right thigh and in a few minutes he could not stand ; he laid himself over the arm chest and bar - ricadoe , determined to keep up the fire , but in a short time from pain and loss of blood , he was unable to command , growing faint , and they helped him below ; as soon as he came too , l!e tound his firing had ceased , and his people round him wounded , and having not a Surgeon with them , in a most distressed situation , most of them groaning , some expiring - Struck severe - ly with such a spectacle , Capt.
Tracy	PERSON	ordered his people to take him up in a chair upon the quarter deck , and resolved again to attack the ship , which was all this time keeping up her fire ; but after getting into the air , he was again so faint , that lle avas for some time unable to speak , and finding no al - ternative , but they must be taken or sunk , for the sake of the brave men that remained , he ordered them to strike to the ship .

Sullivan	PERSON	's Island confined - & for tothe Main , yet as he had not boats for more than 6 or 700 Men , he was reduced to one attack without being able to favour that by any diversion on the other - That he acquainted the Commodore with this discovery , & withhis apprehension that he should not be able with his Troops to take that share in the attack upon the Fort , he was once in hopes to have done ; assuring him however than whenever he should think to begin his attack , he would make every possible diversion in his favor , or send him 2 Battalionsto act on his side , in case he & the Genl Officers appointed to command them , should be of opinion they could be protected in their landing & employed to advantage - That in answer to this , it seemed to be understood that he should give the best support he could , & they only waited for a Wind to begin the attack - That at that time the Rebels had an Intrenchment & Battery on the point of
Sullivan	PERSON	's Island ; but as when they brought up they did not appear to be within such a distance as to avail themselves of their fire from their tops , grapeshot , or musketry , he was apprehensive no impression would be made upon the Battery , & he likewise saw , that the 3 Frigates supposed to have been destined to cut off the Rebel communication with Hederal 's Point & favour his attack upon it , were aground , immediately after the 4 leading Ships had taken their stations .

Cape Ann	PERSON	he observed a sail in the offing , but in his situation did not think of looking after her .
E. S. E.	PERSON	about five leagues distance , they perceived her to be a ship , and soon from her manage - ment to be a ship of war .
Tracy	PERSON	, who intended to make a harbour that night , ordered the brig to be put about for the shore , not then suspecting the ship could come up with him ; but he had not tacked ten minutes before the westerly wind died away , and the ship taking a fresh southerly breeze came fast in , endeavouring to cut the brig off from the shore .
Tracy	PERSON	reserving his whole fire , until the ship , keeping a constant fire , came up within Pistol shot upon his lee quarter when the brig gave her the best return they could make from their main and quarter deck guns , swivels and small arms , and after then kept up a constant fire .
Tracy	PERSON	was unable to fight his lee guns ; upon this he backed under her stern , but the ship , which sailed much faster , and worked as quick , had the advantage , and .
Tracy	PERSON	stacked under her stern , and when clear of the smoke and fire , perceived his rigging to be most shockingly cut , yards flying about without braces , some of his principal sails shot to rags , and half of his men to appearance dying and wounded .
Main	PERSON	, his first Lieutenant , was among the first wounded , and Mr.
Davis	PERSON	, one of the prize masters , fell in the last attack .
Tracy	PERSON	to have recourse to his guns again though he still kept some hands aloft to his rigging ; but before the brig had again fired two broad-sides , Captain
Tracy	PERSON	received a wound in his right thigh , and in a few minutes he could not stand ; he laid himself over the arm chest and barricadoe , determined to keep up the fire , but in a short time , from pain and loss of blood , he was unable to command , growing faint , and they helped him below ; as soon as he came to , he found his firing had ceased , and his people round him wounded , and not having a surgeon with them , in a most distressed situation , most of them groaning and some ex - piring .
Tracy	PERSON	ordered his people to take him up in a chair upon the quarter deck , and resolved again to attack the ship , which was all this time keeping up her fire ; but after getting into the air , he was again so faint that he was for sometime unable to speak , and finding no alternative , but they must be taken or sunk , for the sake of the brave men that remained , he ordered them to strike to the ship -LSB-

Val - cour	PERSON	apparently , and as we hear since from Prisoners , unaprized either of our force or motions .
Carleton	PERSON	only got up , and they sustained a very unequal cannonade of several hours , and were obliged to be ordered to fall back , upon our finding that the rest of the fleet could not be brought up to support them , We then Anchored in a line opposite the Rebels within the distance of Cannon shot , expecting in the morning to be able to engage them with our whole fleet , but , to our great mortification we perceived at day break , that they had found means to escape us unobserved by any of our guard boats or cruizers , thus an opportunity of destroying the whole rebel naval force , at one stroke , was lost , first by an impossibility of bring - ing all our vessels to action , and afterwards by the great diligence used by the enemy in getting away from us .

ETHAN ALLEN	PERSON	-LSB- On board
Richard -RSB- Smith	PERSON	, or his ship at that time , and expected to meet the same rigorous usage I had commonly met with , and prepared my mind accordingly ; but when I came on deck , the captain met me with his hand , welcomed me to his ship , invited me to dine with him that day , and assured me that I should be treated as a gentleman , and that he had given orders , that I should be treated with respect by the ship 's crew .
Capt Smith	PERSON	replied that he had no reward in view , but only treated me as a gentleman ought to be treated ; he said this is a mutable world , and one gentleman never knows but it may be in his power to help another .
Sinith	PERSON	who took my part against gen. -LSB-
Eyre	PERSON	-RSB- Mas - sey ; but he never mentioned any thing of it to me , and I thought it impolite in me to interrogate him , as to any disputes which might have arisen be - tween him and the gen. on my account , as I was a prisoner , and that it was at his option to make free with me on that subject , if he pleased ; and , if he did not , I might take it for granted that it would be unpleasing for me to query about it , though I had a strong propensity to converse with him on that subject .

Burk	PERSON	, with an under officer of the ship , whose name I do not recollect , came to our little birth , proposed to kill capt.
Smith	PERSON	and the principal officers of the frigate and take it ; adding that there were thirty five thousand pounds sterling in the same , capt.
Burk	PERSON	likewise averred that a strong party out of the ship 's crew was in conspir - acy , and urged me , and the gentleman that was with me , to use our influ - ence with the private prisoners , to execute the design , and take the ship with the cash into one of our own ports .
Lovel	PERSON	confirmed what I had said , and farther pointed out the ungratefulness of such an act ; that it did not fall short of murder , and in fine all the gentle - men in the birth opposed capt.
Burk	PERSON	and his colleague : But they strenously urged that the conspiracy would be found out , and that it would cost them their lives , provided they did not execute their design .
Smith	PERSON	's life : If they should attempt the assault , I would assist him , for they desired me to remain neuter , and that the same honor that guarded capt.
Smith	PERSON	's life , would also guard theirs ; and it was agreed by those present not to reveal the conspiracy , to the intent that no man should be put to death , in consequence of what had been projected ; and capt.
Burk	PERSON	and his colleague went to stifle the matter among their associates .
Smith	PERSON	said to me , when I first came on board ; `` This is a mutable world , and one gentleman never knows but that it may be in his power to help another . ''
Smith	PERSON	and his officers still behaved with their usual courtesy , and I never heard any more of the con - spiracy .
Smith	PERSON	informed me , that he had recommended me to adm.
Howe	PERSON	and gen. sir
Wm. Howe	PERSON	, as a gentleman of honor and veracity , and desired that I might be treated as such .
