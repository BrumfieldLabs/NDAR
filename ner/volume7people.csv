PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	Sir , I have this Minuet received yours of the 24th setting forth their Lordships Direction to send to your board Lord
Howe	PERSON	's Orders for bringing home the Convoy of Dutch & English Merchant Ships , together with a list of their Numbers , which I have Inclos 'd herein as I am desired to be very particular when , and the reasons why , that Part of the Convoy left us , I therefore judge it Most Adviseable to send up my Journal for their Lordships Inspection , which will point Out to them the reason of Many Of Our Convoy leaving us , and by Which their Lordships Plainly will See was Occasion 'd by their Paying so little or no Attention to Any Signals Made by me , and I hope their Lordships will allow its not in the power of two of His Majts ships to keep so large a Convoy together against their Inclinations .

M. de Monteil	PERSON	, commanding the frigate la Renommee stationed at the
M. de Monteil	PERSON	encounters the English frigate Squirrel chasing an American schooner near the coast .
Douglas	PERSON	-RRB- to the effect that he will oppose any form of hostility against the ships which are within reach of _ the Mole .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	was anchored in the harbour of the mole in order to unload stores which la
Renommee	PERSON	had taken on in
M. de Monteil	PERSON	receives on board his ship the Insurgent Captain who had escaped in his boat with three sailors , takes his statement and sails towards
Victor	PERSON	in order to inform
M. D'Ennery	PERSON	.
M. Gayton	PERSON	, Admiral , was in the country .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	sends his Lieutenant ,
M. de la Voltiere	PERSON	, to him in order to claim the American schooner which had been brought to the harbor .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	's letter , saying that it is contrary to the assurance of neutrality given by the
M. de Monteil	PERSON	has received many marks of courtesy on the part of the Admiral and all the English officers and he appears to be convinced that the schooner is sequestered and that she will be returned if we insist .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	on 5 September , the pursuit and the plan to recapture the American schooner seized on the 14th of the same month , the trip to
M. de Monteil	PERSON	, stipulate that in the event that some Insurgent vessel or any other neutral vessel having sailed from the European or American ports and chased by English frigates , would come and request the protection of the King 's flag , the said Commanders would not tolerate that these vessels be captured or visited ; but the same instructions give express orders to the effect that they are not to approach the aforementioned vessels and to wait without favoring their manoeuvres until they are close enough to request the flag 's protection .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	contravened his instructions by sailing toward the boat pursued by the English frigate Squirrel on 5 September .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	went toward the insurgent boat and declared to Captain
Douglas	PERSON	that he would oppose any form of hostility , the English frigate was very close to the coast of the Mole .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	can be blamed only for displaying a somewhat too active zeal .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	himself declares that the flag was not displayed at the point of the mole and that the guns had not .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	committed another fault equally serious when he went to
M. de Monteil	PERSON	's mission ; thus , he disregarded the King 's orders by leaving his station and he failed in his duty to the Governor 's authority by taking upon himself the responsibility of a measure which did not concern him .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	behaved well in
M. de Monteil	PERSON	's request which compromised this officer only .
M. de Monteil	PERSON	pretends in his correspondence that he was authorized to act on his own .
