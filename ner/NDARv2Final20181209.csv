FRANCIS LEGGE	PERSON	TO GENERAL THOMAS GAGE Sir .


Nova Scotia Halifax	LOCATION	4th September 1775 I have the honor of transmitting the Copy of a letter relating an Account of Hostilities and depredations committed on
St Johns River	LOCATION	in this Province , the truth of which was confirm 'd before me in Council , by the Evidence of one of the Owners of a
Brigantine	LOCATION	which was taken , and one of the Navigators , who were both on Board at that time , there is also the Copy of a letter , wrote by certain persons , said to belong to
Machias	LOCATION	, to the Magestrates on that
River	LOCATION	, from whence , and from all Accounts , it appears that these depredations , & those which are threatned , are to Terrify and prevent the people of this Province , from providing or sending any supplies to the
King 's Forces	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	, & that untill there is a sufficient Force , to Awe these Rebels & to Countenance the people well dispos 'd , all supplies will be prevented and Cutt off , & the Province from actual Rebels and disaffected persons will be expos 'd to imminent danger ; as there can be little or no dependance on the greater part of the Militia who are too well dispos 'd to the Cause of their Countrymen .

		It was therefore resolv 'd in Council , that Application shoud be made to the Admiral , that he woud Order two Sloops of War to the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	for the protection of those parts of this Province .

Watertown	LOCATION	, September 4 .

		Early last Wednesday morning -LSB- August 30 -RSB- the
Rose Man	PERSON	of War , with three Tenders , was observed chasing several small Vessels into the Harbour of
Stonington	LOCATION	, supposed to be from
Block Island	LOCATION	; one of the Inhabitants being down on the shore with a Trumpet , attempting to pilot the Vessels into the
Harbour	LOCATION	, was ordered by one of the Tenders to desist , or he would fire on the town ; he returned for Answer , he might do as he pleased .

		Immediately the Tender ran alongside of the Wharves , and fired a whole Broadside on the Town and People , which was returned by a Volley of Small Arms from the People , and after exchanging several vollies , the Tender bore away and join 'd the man of war and two Tenders , and before Ten oClock the Rose ship of war and the three Tenders were close within 60 or 80 Rods of the Wharves , and began a heavy Fire on the Town and Inhabitants until the Middle of the Day , when they ceased for two Hours ; in which Interval Application was made to know the reasons of these Hostilities , Answer was returned , that they began the first Fire on him , -LRB- than which nothing can be more false -RRB- and after about two Hours , the fire began again , and continued till Night .

		ー Thursday Morning they took sundry Vessels out of the
Harbour	LOCATION	, one from
Surranam	LOCATION	belonging to Patuxet with Molasses , and appeared as if going into
New-London	PERSON	.

		It is supposed there hath been no Stock yet taken from

		GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	TO VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES -LRB- Copy -RRB-
Boston	LOCATION	September 4th 1775 .

		Sir , In your Letter of the 1st Instant you apply to me for Men , Ordnance and Vessels , together with a small Detachment from the
Royal Regiment of Artillery	ORGANIZATION	, and a Detachment of other Troops under the Command of a Steady Experienced Officer , as you purpose to lay waste such Sea Ports Towns in the New-England Governments as are not likely to be useful to His Majesty 's Forces , and to Destroy all the Vessels within the Harbours .

		I shall readily supply you as far as is in my Power to do , but if by Men you mean Sailors the Transports are already very poorly Manned , many of them out , and more going out to procure Articles Necessary for the Maintenance and Subsistence of the Garrison .

		The Commanding Officer of Artillery has Orders to give you an account of such Quantitys of Ordnance and Stores as he shall be able to furnish , and it 's necessary to be informed of the Places to be Attacked before any Judgement can be formed of the Number of Troops that will be required for such a service The Symmetry and
Spitfire	ORGANIZATION	you may fit up as you please , but as the Transports here are few , of Course few Carpenters can be had from them , I will enquire of them what Number they can provide , and of the Officer Commanding the
Royal Artillery	ORGANIZATION	, whether the Artillery Carpenters can be taken off the work they are upon .

		It is to be wished that something of this kind had been proposed at an earlier Period , when it would have been more in my Power to have furnished the Supplys you demand , however I shall do all I am able in the present Moment , to forward the Plan you have formed , you have been acquainted with the Projects of the People to the Eastward from
Casco Bay	LOCATION	to
Machias	LOCATION	to make some Attack upon
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, I hope the Naval Force in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	and at
Halifax	LOCATION	will Effectually prevent all attempts of that Nature .

		I am with the greatest Regard and Esteem Sir & ca 1 .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
FRANCIS LEGGE	PERSON	Sir ,
Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	4 Sepr 1775 I have received your Excellency 's Letters August 15 and 16 with Copies of Lieutt Governor
Franklyn	PERSON	's and Mr
Dechamps	PERSON	inclosed .

		It was certainly a proper measure to send the
Senegal	LOCATION	to the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, and Captain -LSB-
Edward -RSB- Medows	PERSON	acted very right in not leaving
Halifax Harbour	LOCATION	upon the uncertain information given by Captain
Duddingstone	PERSON	.

		By the latest Accounts from
Windsor	LOCATION	and
Annapolis	LOCATION	-LSB- Royal -RSB- I do not find there is a pirate in the
Bay	LOCATION	, the one thought to be about the
Bason	PERSON	of
Minas	ORGANIZATION	is at
Mechias	LOCATION	, from whence I have no Doubt the Rebels will give your Excellency 's Government what disturbance they can .

		I am greatly concerned to find you have those amongst you who are not to be trusted .

		However your Excellency may rely upon having every Support in my Power .

		I beg leave to introduce to your Acquaintance Captain
Le Cras	PERSON	of his Majs Ship Somerset , who is gone to
Halifax	LOCATION	to refit a leaky Ship ; This Gentleman is a very active and experienced Officer , and I am persuaded your Excellency will have great Pleasure in carrying on his
Majs Service	ORGANIZATION	with him , as he will readily co-operate in and pursue such Measures for the general Safety as shall be judged adviseable on any Emergency .

		I have sent the
Merlin	PERSON	with Convoy to the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, so that there are now two large Sloops and two armed Schooners there , and as the Tartar will go to
Annapolis	LOCATION	, I have not sent the
Scarborough	PERSON	as I at first intended .

		His Majesty 's Ships shall keep on the Coast as long as possible , but your Excellency must be sensible how extremely difficult it will be to prevent Insults from the Rebels with Ships alone .

		I am therefore in hopes , should you not have sufficient Succours from General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, that a good Body of Militia will be found whose fidelity can be depended on .

		I am & c
Sam	PERSON	l Graves 1 .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO REAR ADMIRAL ROBERT DUFF Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	4 Sepr 1775 Your known Zeal for his Majesty 's Service encourages me to make known to you the Condition of the
King 's Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under my Command with respect to men , and to hope for such Assistance as you can afford .

		Besides the common losses by Sickness and by Desertions which have lately much prevailed , we have been unfortunate in having a great many good men taken prisoners by the Rebels , and some killed and wounded , which has so reduced our Numbers that I am sometimes under the necessity of manning the Sloops and smaller Vessels from the large Ships ; but these have generally so many detached on Harbour Duty , that they can ill afford to be further weakened ; and although ever since I have had the honor to command on this Station we have endeavoured by pressing to Keep compleat yet the Ships are still many short of Complement .

		I should not have troubled you on this Occasion had we the usual Resources of Merchantships to get Men from , but
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	on this Coast will very soon be in a manner annihilated , The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	forbidding what the restraining Acts permit ; and I am persuaded you are too well acquainted with the Dispositions of these People to doubt their paying implicit obedience to Congressional Directions ; so that there is almost a certainty of our losing men , and little or no prospect of replacing them in the ordinary Method .

		The
Kings Authority	ORGANIZATION	is entirely at an End throughout the Continent , except in
Canada	LOCATION	,
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	and the Floridas ; even
Georgia	LOCATION	has sent Delegates to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and entered deeply into the Rebellion .

		The Spirit of Revolt begins also to be discovered in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	.

		It is almost certain that something is planning against that Government , but whether by way of Insult and Depredation or of a more serious Nature is not yet known ; however I have sent the
Somerset	LOCATION	to
Halifax	LOCATION	for its Security , and hope to effectually prevent any Designs the Rebels may have from taking effect against the King 's Yard and Stores .

		The Rebels have armed Vessels on the Coast , who at present confine their Operations to stoping Supplies coming to us from the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, and we have Reports of many Pirates of Force being out ; but are only certain of those from
Mechias	LOCATION	, and from
Providence	LOCATION	near
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		I believe by this time not a Ship on the Coast can get supplies , or refreshments of any kind , but what are taken by force or Stratagem , At
New York	LOCATION	excepted where the
Asia	LOCATION	is allowed what is sufficient for herself .

		The New England Contracts are broke up , those to the Southward I suppose will soon fail .

		Already we have received Supplies from
England	LOCATION	, and our sole reliance for Provisions must be from thence .

		Our situation the approaching winter will be truly critical as the Ships will be exposed to the Insults , and , if frozen up , to the Attacks of the most ungenerous and implacable Enemy ; but under all these disadvantages if we can but get Men , and they continue healthy , we shall do tolerably well .

		I flatter myself that as your situation enables you to get young healthy fellows , you will be so good to send me as many as can be spared , and if you can add a few Marines , when you return to
England	LOCATION	, it will be doubly serving us , at a time when his
Majs Service	ORGANIZATION	requires our utmost Exertions .

		I do not exactly know who will have the Honour to deliver you this Letter , having directed Captain
Le Cras	PERSON	to send it by the first Sloop or Schooner that could be got ready at
Halifax	LOCATION	, for at
Boston	LOCATION	I have not a Vessel of any kind to spare , which makes me wish the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	may admit of your ordering one of your Squadron to bring the men to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		It is farther necessary to acquaint you that the Lighthouse at
Boston	LOCATION	, and those on Thatchers Island , commonly called
Cape Ann	LOCATION	lights , are destroyed ; that no lights will be shewn this Winter , and that all Ships coming this way must beware of false Lights , and also have an Eye on the Conduct of any Pilots they follow or may take on board ; an Attempt has been already made to mislead one of the Transports coming to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I beg you to accept my hearty Congratulations on your promotion , and my sincerest Wishes for your Health and safe return to
England	LOCATION	, which I suppose will begin as customary the beginning of November .

HALIFAX	LOCATION	Sir
Preston	PERSON	at
Boston	ORGANIZATION	4 Sepr 1775 , Herewith you will receive a Letter for Rear Admiral
Duff	PERSON	at
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, requesting , at his going away , to let me have what Seamen and Marines he can conveniently spare , the former I suppose may be had , or at least young healthy Fishermen , at the breaking up of the Season .

		I would have you send the Letter to the Admiral either by the Savage or Hinchinbrook , as you shall think best ; and if the
Hinchinbrook	PERSON	goes put the Savage 's Guns into her and let that Sloop take the four
Pounders	PERSON	, if you think them too heavy for the Schooner .

		The sooner one of them sails the better , and order the Officer to return to
Halifax	LOCATION	from whence you will either send him on to
Boston	LOCATION	or otherwise as shall then be found best for the Service .

		I am informed the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	have given an Appointment of Admiral to a Mr -LSB-
Jeremiah -RSB- OBrien	PERSON	at
Mechias	LOCATION	, that this Admiral has increased his
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	to six Sail including the Diligent , and that some Plan is certainly forming against
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, but at what place he means to begin first is not yet known .

		The Rebels have many friends in that Government , Persons of property and influence , and capable of doing great Mischief , but I hope the Governor will get a good body of loyal Militia on the
Western Coast	LOCATION	of his Government , and that with our Assistance the Rebels will be disappointed in their Views .

		But we must be attentive and vigilant .

		These and other Circumstances have determined me to let you winter at
Halifax	LOCATION	and to put the
Savage	PERSON	and
Cruizer	PERSON	under your Command , and I am satisfied you will give the utmost Dispatch to the Ships fitting out , and not suffer any of them to lie unnecessarily in

MORGAN LEWIS	PERSON	TO MAJOR
SAMUEL BLACHLEY WEBB	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
New York	LOCATION	, 4th September , 1775 .

		You doubtless have by this time heard that the Asia Ship of War , Ct -LSB-
George -RSB- Vandeput	PERSON	, has fired eight and twenty cannon , besides grape and cannister shot , into our
City	LOCATION	in consequence of our People 's moving some cannon from off the Battery by virtue of an order from the P -LSB- rovincial -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our People returned the salute with their musquetry , by which means one of their People was killed and -LRB- as we supposed -RRB- several others were wounded .

		Three of our People were wounded , none killed .

		But how will you be surprised when I inform you that our pusillanimous
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, notwithstanding these daring Insults , have been driven by their fears to a compromise , and have promised to supply the ship as usual with provisions .

		But we have more virtue out of Doors , than in the
Cabinet	ORGANIZATION	.

		The People , roused by a just sense of their Injuries , have burnt two long boats that were seen coming from the Man of War , and yesterday had the pleasure of taking a large sloop with twelve Tories on board , who were supplying one of the Transports with provisions for
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The scene was really diverting , and our taking her with so much ease rather Providential .

		ー A very heavy gale came on Saturday evening -LSB- September 2 -RSB- which lasted till Sunday morning at ten o'clock , about which time the sloop parted her cables , and the wind blowing hard up the
River	LOCATION	, after several fruitless attempts to reach the
Asia	LOCATION	, she bore away before it .

		Our People immediately pursued her in small boats .

		The
Asia	LOCATION	's tender with about 70 marines besides seamen pursued her .

		But
Vandeput	PERSON	, seeing us mounting some twelve pounders upon two sloops and manning them very strong , guessed at our Intentions and prudently hove out a signal for the Tender 's return , which to our great mortification she instantly obeyed .

		After a ten miles chase they came up with the Boat , and altho ' every man on board was doubly armed , took her without exchanging a single shot .

		When they got her to the shore , it being very wet and cold , their compassion induced them to set her on fire , by way of warming the Passengers Fingers .

JOSEPH BELTON	PERSON	TO THE
PENNSYLVANIA	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY Gentlemen , Not long since having laid a plan under your consideration , and have not since been able to obtain your Oppinions on the same .

		Wheather you have judged that some conciliatory plan will soon be adopted , for which reason there will be no occasion , to encourage any harsh , or destructive meathod whatever , if so there is no more to be said .

		But if otherwise you have concluded , that the plan itself might prove abortive , either through the inability of the undertaker , or the imperfection of the plan itself , and you by encouraging it with the publick 's money , would become liable to be censured by the publick for so doing , which to remove as well as all other Objections ; I will now assert what I will undertake to Perform , which is as follows , -LRB- viz. -RRB- I will make a Machine by the help of which , I will carry a loaded cannon , two or three miles up or down any of our harbours without any other assistance , and all the way there should nothing appear above the surface much larger than a man 's hat , and by attracting -LSB- sic contracting -RSB- my
Machine	ORGANIZATION	, would wholely decend under warter for some time , and by expanding , would rise to the surface at pleasure , and by this means , to avoid any discovery when I had arrived within an hundred and fifty , or two hundred yards of a Ship , I could decend under the surface , and go along side of her bottom against which , I could discharge the Cannon , that should be prov 'd large enough to send a ball through any ships side .

		Now perhaps Gentlemen , there will many Queries arise in your minds , as how should I be able to stop myself , in a rapid tide with all this Machinery ?

		To which I answer , that I would have a small Grapling , which by leting go , I could stop when and where I pleased .

		But how should I be able to see or discover any thing ?

		I would have a thick clear glass in front , and my head just touching the top of my
Machine	ORGANIZATION	, so that when my eyes was just at the surface , all the Machine that would naturally be above would not be larger than what I have before mentioned , and it would be only requisite now and then to see , that I was floating in a true direction for the object I had in view , and the rest of the time , I might be immerged more , so as not to appear larger than a man 's fist , so by this means begining to float in the Eavening at a large distance , just keeping my object in view , which being large I could easily do , when they on board could not possably discover any thing of me , and if I found that I floated too fast , and was likely to get up before it was dark , and by that means be liable to be discovered , I would drop my grapling and ride by it , till I thought proper to proceede , by this means droping up with the tide , when I had come with in an hundred yards of the ship , I would drop my grapling and by pay-out line gently drop up uncler the wake of her Bowsprit , and under her bows , and so long side ; and chouse what part I thought most conclusive to effect my purpose .

		But how should I be able to move myself with all this Machinery ?

		I would have fins like fixed at my feet , & arms which by pushing from me would naturally expand and take large hold of the water , and when drawn to me would attract & take little or none , by this means I could move considerable fast , & even venture to stem a small tide .

		And perhaps you may think that one gun would not be sufficient .

		To which I reply , that two or three may be convey 'd in the same box , & all discharged by the same lock .

		And you may think that by any accident I should suddenly immerge myself I should thereby be liable to be drowned , to which I answer , that the little pipe , which need not exceed two or three inches in length , through which I have a communication with the air , at the top of this I would have a valve , which should be kept about half open with a feable spring , which by any sudden immersion the natural pressure of the warter , would shet perfectly tite , and only take in a spoonfull or two , but allowing I had at sundry times , taken in considerable warter , I could be expanding , & keeping a little motion with my feet , raise myself higher above the surface than common , & by turning a cock just below my chin , I would let out all the warter .

		For the part which my body was in , it being the part which I expanded , should be perfect tite of itself , and should have no communication with the appartment of my head , so that a person in one of these Machines need never be in danger of drowning .

		As hearing as well as seeing might in the night be advantagious , so likewise 1 would have a small doar in front , which I could open & shut at pleasure , by which I could hear perfectly well .

		But to conclude as experiments will speak plainer than words , and being conscious of my own abillities , I will engage to shew experimental all that I have herein asserted , and upon my non performance , I will become obligated to reimburse all that you may advance ; so that the whole expence should then fall upon myself , and not the publick .

		And if I performed according to what is asserted , then I should be intitled to such , as you thought my ingenuity and plan merrited , though at the same time Gentlemen , I can assure you , that I am not excited so much with the view of incuring premiums , as that of sarving my country in so glorious a cause .

		And would readily engage , after making a few experiments , to sink , or destroy , the admirals ship now in
Boston	LOCATION	, or any other ever so difficultly situated , as I can readily conceive , of several other destructive meathod might be pursued , some by the Machine only , & some by the Gun only , which I shall omit at present , but shall be allways ready to inlarge on , and would likewise prepare similar Machines , for as many men as there were Ships of force , and after they had become acquainted with the Machine and the effects of it , by makeing several experiments , we would all retire to where the ships were , and each man pitch upon a ship , & at a proper time attempt to sink ; each man his ship , which I can prove might be put in execution at the same minute of time , though there might be twenty or thirty ships , & to lay in different parts of the harbour , which if this plan succeeded so well as to effect the destruction of the ships , the whole army of course , would very easily fall into our hands , & those ministerial tooles , who are now impowered , and authorized , to take the heads of our land , & drag them to an ignominious death .

		I say these very tooles would now fall into our hands to be held out to the redemtion of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Methinks this nuse would appear to our King , as the hand writing did to the grand monarch of old , conscious guilt , of shedding the innocent Blood of his loyal people , would now instantly seize him , convulsive terrour shake his whole frame , chilling horrour freeze his blood , -LRB- perhaps never more to circulate , -RRB- dire dismay & confusion overtake his wicked Counsellors , be the happy means of opening the eyes of the deluded people , and work out a glorious revolution in favour of us now distressed Americans , fix perminent our Liberties , reestablish that union which once so happily subsisted between the Parent state and these her Colonies , so great , so noble an undertaken , has often almost reduc 'd me to dispare , but being ever supported with the conscious knowledge , that the overruling hand of
Providence	LOCATION	, attends all the actions of men , and to mannifest its power , it has often been pleased to make use of small and obscure means , to effect wondrous revolutions , in defecting armies that were engageed in a wrong cause , -LRB- even so small as the sling of a stone . -RRB-

		Which to be maid anyway enstrumental , of effecting so glorious a revolution , is of itself abundant reward .

		And as the Plan is form 'd not to shed Blood , or to trifle with the lives of men , but merely to destroy some floating , wooden engines , which are sent to our distruction ,
Methinks Saints	ORGANIZATION	and Angles would encourage such a plan , and Heaven itself smile upon it , and if that is for it , who can be against it .

		Pardon ,
Gentlemen.	LOCATION	, the intrusion of these so natural reflections ; at the same time , permit me , to beg your candid sentiments upon what is here disclosed , which will be acknowledged as a favour by Your most Obediant -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Joseph Belton	PERSON	.

		CAPTAIN
JOHN COLLINS	PERSON	, R.N. , TO VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES Copy Nautilus in
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	the 5th of September 1775 .

		Sir In pursuance of your Orders of the 11th of June , after sending the Transports to
Boston	LOCATION	, Entered
Delaware Bay	LOCATION	the 20th July , the 22d Anchored off
Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	in the River , as the best Situation for inspecting the Trade , and having
Command of the Town	ORGANIZATION	, did by that means obtain Refreshments , two of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	being Inhabitants , yet the Spirit of Opposition at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and the Country round was such , that they expressed great dissatisfaction at my being there , and were ready to enter into any violent Act that should be pointed out to them , this with the intricate Navigation of upwards of 30 Leagues from the Sea , and being solely at the Mercy of a
Philadelphia Pilot	LOCATION	, kept us in a constant alarm , but I was daily in expectation of some Reinforcement from You , Sir , or at least a Schooner by whom we might have made our Situation known .

		ー On the 13th of August at Night , as I have been informed , the Ship Hope passed us with a fresh of Wind and strong Flood Tide , with Major -LSB-
Christopher	PERSON	-RSB- French , -LSB- a -RSB- 1st Lieutenant and a Volunteer , with Packages of Military Cloathing on board ; 2 upon hailing , they told the Officer on Deck , that they had nothing but Ballast in , and was Eleven Weeks from
Ireland	LOCATION	: had I had the least intimation from the Major or his Party of their Situation , should certainly have slip 'd and followed her up , but at the time I was acquainted with it , twas too late for me to demand Restitution , they were then in the Hands of the Philadelphians who were determined to support this hostile Act , had my Orders permitted me to have Attacked the Town .

		Have ever since endeavored to prevent any future fraud by making every Vessel Anchor ; as I had but one Eight Oar 'd Boat , the others being of insufficient Force to prevent being run away with , it was a very difficult and tedious task , as the Trade carried on in the
Delaware	LOCATION	at this time is equal to all the rest in
America	LOCATION	, and this to a great City of 50,000 Inhabitants , with several other Towns near to its Banks ; this delay made them talk high , my Seizing the Tryall Schooner belonging to one of their
Committee	ORGANIZATION	,
Mr Miffling	PERSON	, and a Sloop with Coffee , gave them a pretext , and brought them all in Arms ; the Son of the Owner who I had given leave to come onboard , after giving him my reason for Stopping the Schooner ; desired he might be permitted to speak with the Master , which I granted ; sent Lieutenant
Browne	PERSON	onboard after him , who on his going away heard him confirm that the People were in Arms , and that 4,000 had offered their Service to his father to make the Attack , and that some Lives should be lost on the occasion ; I wanted no confirmation of their readiness or Numbers to remove any one Single Deck Ship , and therefore with the general
Voice of my Officers	ORGANIZATION	, thought it most adviseable for the good of His Majesty 's Service not to put it to the trial , but to make the best of our way to
Boston	LOCATION	with our Prizes , and make a Report of the Situation and preparations making at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to oppose his Majesty 's Arms .

		At this time by our Purser 's Account and others , two row Gallies carrying one 18 Pounder in the Bow and 40 Men each , including
Twenty Rowers	ORGANIZATION	, Seven more finished , and to be compleated to Twenty as soon as possible ; an Establishment of # 90,000 is appropriated for Building and Manning them during the open Season : their Trade stops the 10th of September , and the Seamen will be taken up for that Service and Artillery & ca ー Two fire Ships Compleat , near four hundred Sail of Shipping , about Thirty of them from 4 to 500 Tons burthen , several of them with Ports to take Guns in , with about 2000 Seamen ;
Twelve Pieces of Cannon	ORGANIZATION	mounted in the Market Place from : 12 to 24 Pounders ready to be carried to any Spot by the Sailors and one Company of Artillery ; Twenty large Cannon in a tier and Carriages ready for Mounting them ; Three Battalions making about 2200 Men well Cloathed and Armed for the Guard of the Town ; and I am told that from the Entrance of the Capes to the Town , not less than 3 or 4000 more meet and exercise Twice a Week , at
Glocester Point	LOCATION	they have Triangles almost finished , which 't is supposed will effectually stop up the Passage of the Narrows , and may be effected in one Tide .

		I am satisfied Sir , that if a sufficient Force can be spared to enforce Obedience from the Town , ` twould be a means , from the great Number of people of Consequence residing there , and many Friends that dare not at this time shew themselves with their very great Attachment to the Town of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, of making the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	very quiet , and a great Number might be Recruited for His Majesty 's Service .

		The Taxes Levied by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, has caused no little dissatisfaction , for they say if they are to pay Taxes why not to the King , and save the Cutting of their Countrymen 's throats ; there being a great Number of
Old England People	LOCATION	in the Province , Emigrants and Servants from

WILLIAM TRYON	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	My Lord ,
New York	LOCATION	5th Septr 1775 As I was on
Long Island	LOCATION	at the time of the disturbances in this city occasioned by the citizens removing in the night of the 23rd of last month Twenty one peices of Ordnance , nine pounders , that were mounted on the Battery under Fort George I transmit to your Lordship copies of the correspondence that passed between the Mayor of the City and
Captn Vandeput	PERSON	of his Majesty 's Ship
Asia	LOCATION	on the occasion as the best evidence I can collect of that affair .

		On my receiving intelligence the twenty fourth in the evening of what had passed , that a mob had searched my house the same evening though they said for Captn -LSB-
Edward -RSB- Foy	PERSON	, and that a party of Provincials had been on
Long Island	LOCATION	in quest both of Captain
Foy	PERSON	& myself , I nevertheless the next morning came into Town and got together -LRB- not in
Council	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as many of the Gentlemen of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	as were on the spot , and proposed to them to meet the principal inhabitants of the city and country that were in Town in the Council Room at the
City Hall	LOCATION	, Including the corporation , Provincial officers , Committees and
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, in order to persuade them to desist from carrying things to farther extremities .

		This measure considering the high ferment of peoples minds , my friends approved of and I met the Gentlemen the next morning accordingly .

		When after lamenting the present unhappy controversy , and alarming situation to which the public affairs of the Country was reduced I recommended to them for the present public safety , that the Guns taken from the battery might remain on the Common That no further attempt should be made on the
Kings Stores	ORGANIZATION	as I was confident a fresh attempt would produce fresh disturbances & endanger the city as Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	had those stores under his protection and must do his Duty .

		That the town should furnish the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	ship with fresh provisions , but to prevent disorder the Boats from the city might carry the provision on Board .

		I urged how important it was to their own Interest to preserve a temperate conduct , and not wantonly to draw down calamity upon themselves but wait the determination of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, as some further plan of accomodation might be held out for the ground of a reconciliation .

		Since I knew it was the warmest wish of the Royal Breast to see us again a happy and united people .

		This was nearly the substance of what I said to them .

		I was heard with Temper ー and attention .

		The city has remained quiet since , and fresh provisions are to be delivered on the Governors Island for the
Asia	LOCATION	.

		I sent
Captn Vandeput	PERSON	a letter the 25th a copy of which is herewith enclosed to inform him of my intention to meet the principal Inhabitants of the Country Since which there has been no direct communication between the
Asia	LOCATION	and the Town .

		A Boat which carried only some milk on Board was burnt on her return to shore as was last Sunday -LSB- September 3 -RSB- a country Sloop for having put some provisions on Board of the man of war .

		Such is the rage of the present animosity .

		For further particulars of our Situation I beg leave to refer you to
Captn Foy	PERSON	, who from the Frenzy of the times has been pursued and drove from this distracted Country .

		At least one third of the citizens have moved with their effects out of Town and many of the Inhabitants will shortly experience the distresses of necessity and want .

		GEORGE WASHINGTON TO
NICHOLAS COOKE	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- Camp at

		Sir : Your Favor of the 30th August and 2d Inst .

		are duly received ; The Concurrence of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in the
Bermuda Voyage	ORGANIZATION	is very agreeable and I hope will prove a happy
Earnest	LOCATION	of its Success ; Inclosed is a Letter to the Inhabitants of that Island of the tenor you have Suggested ; but I shall depend upon Capt.
-LSB- Abraham -RSB- Whipple	PERSON	's not making use of it , except in Case of real Necessity .

		I am to acknowledge your kind assistance to Capt.
Bayler	PERSON	in his late Errand , and must desire you to make known to Messrs.
Clark	PERSON	& Nightingale , that I am very sensible of the Patriotic and disinterested Part they have acted on this Occasion ... The Removal of the Stock from the Coast and
Islands	LOCATION	, will I hope have its Effect , in sending the Minesterial Plunderers empty home .

		We have yet no Accounts of the last Fleet , except 6 , who retum 'd from
Louisburgh	LOCATION	with Coal , a few Days ago .

		I need not mention to you the vast Importance of gaining Intelligence of the Enemy 's Motions and Designs , as early as possible ; The great saving to the Continent both of Blood and Money ; a Detection of our secret and most Dangerous Enemies , with innumerable other Advantages , would result from the Interception of their Correspondence at this Juncture ; I have therefore thought Proper to propose to you the Seizing the Mail by the next Packet ; She is Hourly expected from
England	LOCATION	; her Force of Men and Guns inconsiderable ; none but Swivels and only mann 'd with 18 men .

		If the Vessel proposed to go to
Bermuda	LOCATION	should cruize for a few Days off
Sandy Hook	PERSON	, I have no
Doubt	ORGANIZATION	she would fall in with her ; In which Case she might with little or no Delay land the Mail , in order to be forwarded to me and proceed on her Voyage ; But if there are any material Objections to this Mode , I am still so anxious upon the Subject , that I would have it tried with another Vessel at the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Expence and will for that end direct , that any charge which may accrue in this Service shall be paid by the Paymaster here , upon being duly liquidated .

		It will be necessary that some person well acquainted with the Packets should be on Board our Vessel , or the Stopping inward bound Vessels indiscriminately will give the Alarm and she may be apprised of her Danger ; The choice of a proper Officer with the care of providing a suitable Vessel & c. I must leave to you .

		should it meet with the desired Success there can be no doubt the Honble .


Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	will distinguish and Reward the officer and men who shall have done so essential a Service ; Nor shall I fail in making known to them how much the
Public Service	ORGANIZATION	is indebted to you for your Zeal and Activity on all occasions .

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO THE INHABITANTS OF

Boston	LOCATION	, September 6 , 1775 .

		Gentn : In the great Conflict , which agitates this Continent , I can not doubt but the Assertors of Freedom and the Rights of the Constitution , are possessed of your most favorable Regards and Wishes for Success .

		As Descendents of Freemen and Heirs with us of the same Glorious Inheritance , we flatter ourselves that tho ' divided by our Situation , we are firmly united in Sentiment ; the
Cause of Virtue and Liberty	ORGANIZATION	is Confined to no Continent or Climate , it comprehends within its capacious Limits , the Wise and good , however dispersed and seperated in Space or distance .

		You need not be informed , that Violence and Rapacity of a tyrannick
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	, have forced the
Citizens of America	ORGANIZATION	, your Brother Colonists , into Arms ; We equally detest and lament the Prevalence of those Councils , which have led to the Effusion of so much human Blood and left us no Alternative but a Civil War or a base Submission .

		The wise disposer of all Events has hitherto smiled upon our virtuous Efforts ; Those Mercenary Troops , a few of whom lately boasted of Subjugating this vast Continent , have been check 'd in their earliest Ravages and are now actually encircled in a small Space ; their Arms disgraced , and Suffering all the Calamities of a Siege .

		The Virtue ,
Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, and Union of the Provinces leave them nothing to fear , but the
Want of Amunition	ORGANIZATION	, The applications of our Enemies to foreign States and their Vigilance upon our Coast , are the only Efforts they have made against us with Success .

		Under those Circumstances , and with these Sentiments we have turned our Eyes to you Gentlemen for Relief , We are informed there is a very large Magazine in your Island under a very feeble Guard ; We would not wish to involve you in an Opposition , in which from your Situation , we should be unable to support you : ー We knew not therefore to what Extent to sollicit your Assistance in availing ourselves of this Supply ; ー but if your Favor and Friendship to
North America	LOCATION	and its Liberties have not been misrepresented , I persuade myself you may , consistent with your own Safety , promote and further this Scheme , so as to give it the fairest prospect of Success .

		Be assured , that in this Case , the whole Power and Execution of my Influence will be made with the Honble .


Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that your Island may not only be Supplied with Provisions , but experience every other Mark of Affection and Friendship , which the grateful Citizens of a free Country can bestow on its Brethren and Benefactors .

		I am & c. 1 .

		Captain
Tollemache	PERSON	sailed accordingly the 23d with the
Palliser Transport	ORGANIZATION	under his Convoy with Directions to put into her all the Cannon and
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	at
Fort Johnson	LOCATION	in
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		I sent Orders likewise for the Tamer to call at

Savage Sloop	ORGANIZATION	arrived from
New Providence	LOCATION	, and the next day the
Charlotte	LOCATION	hired Sloop returned from carrying Dispatches along the Continent as low as
Charles Town	PERSON	, and over to
New Providence	LOCATION	.

		By Captain -LSB-
Hugh -RSB- Bromedge	PERSON	I received Letters from Lieutenant -LSB-
William -RSB- Grant of the St John Schooner	PERSON	, who sailed from -LSB- New -RSB-
Providence	LOCATION	to
Georgia	LOCATION	the 22d May ; from that time until his Departure in the middle of July for -LSB- New -RSB-
Providence	LOCATION	again , I find he has been pretty usefully employed at
St Augustine	LOCATION	and
Savannah	LOCATION	, And that having no opportunity of Conveyance to
Boston	LOCATION	, he had acquainted you with his proceedings by Letter dated
St John	ORGANIZATION	, Cockspur Road June 19 , 1775 .

		Upon his Arrival at -LSB- New -RSB-
Providence	LOCATION	Captain
Bromedge	PERSON	-LRB- in pursuance of my directions -RRB- sent him to
Pensacola	LOCATION	to bring back Governor
-LSB- Mountfort -RSB- Browne	PERSON	.

		Lieut. Grants Letters contain very long Accounts of the People of
Georgia	LOCATION	's Proceedings in sending Delagates to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, tumultuously assembling in the Cause of Liberty , threatning those who do not join them , and even vowing to destroy the
St John Schooner	ORGANIZATION	.

		But we are so accustomed to this language that I will not trouble you with the relation of what Mr
Grant	PERSON	experienced at
Savannah	LOCATION	.

		On the 28th I ordered the Lively to cruize from
Piscatagua	LOCATION	to the Isle of Shoals and
Cape Anne	LOCATION	; and the Savage from
Cape Ann	LOCATION	to
Cape Cod	LOCATION	in
Boston Bay	LOCATION	.

		The new
Halifax Schooner	ORGANIZATION	arrived the 1st instant from
Halifax	LOCATION	, she is an exceeding commodious , fine Vessel with many good Qualities , but I find much too large for her low Complement , therefore at present I allow her Commander to bear ten Supernumeraries , for with less than forty men she can not safely be navigated .

		I hope their Lordships will be pleased to increase her Establishment to that number of Men .

		Immediately on her Arrival I ordered Lieut. -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB-
Dela Touche	PERSON	to cruize in the
Bay of Boston	LOCATION	.

		On the third Instant some Transports arrived from
Quebec	LOCATION	with live Cattle and Forage for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	; I received a Letter from Lieut. -LSB-
William -RSB- Hunter	PERSON	acquainting me that being at
Quebec	LOCATION	to compleat his provisions , General
Carleton	PERSON	had requested him to proceed up the River to assist the Kings Land forces against the Rebels , which he immediately complied with .

		I inclose a Copy of General Carletons Letter to Lieutenant
Hunter	PERSON	.

		By a Vessel on the point of sailing from hence to
Quebec	LOCATION	I sent an Order to Lieut.
Hunter	PERSON	to remain in the
River	LOCATION	and assist Governor
Carleton	PERSON	to the utmost of his power , until he received further Orders .

		The Wind for several days blowing strong easterly prevented the Lively ,
Savage	PERSON	, and
Halifax	LOCATION	from getting out of
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	till Yesterday .

		When the
Charlotte	LOCATION	hired
Sloop	PERSON	returned from -LSB- New -RSB-
Providence	LOCATION	I received Intelligence that a quantity of Gunpowder , many fine Cannon , Mortars , Howitzers , Shells , Shot , and other
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	on the
Island	LOCATION	, would certainly be removed to the Continent if not secured .

		I therefore proposed to General
Gage	PERSON	to send Transports to bring away the whole immediately ; the General consented ; Two Transports were ordered for this Service , I manned the Falcon from the
Preston	PERSON	, ordered Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Linzee	PERSON	with the Transports on this Duty , and he sailed with the other Ships the 5th instant from
Nantasket	LOCATION	.

		The 4th I wrote a Letter to Rear Admiral
Duff	PERSON	at
Newfoundland	LOCATION	generally informing him of the Situation of the Kings Affairs on this Continent , of the destruction of
Cape Anne	LOCATION	and
Boston Lighthouse	ORGANIZATION	, that it was suspected Gunpowder , Arms , and Ammunition were smugled into
North America	LOCATION	from the Islands of
St Peter	LOCATION	and
Miquelon	PERSON	, that the
King 's Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under my Command was in want of Seamen , and proposed to Mr
Duff	PERSON	on his leaving the Station to send me as many young healthy Fishermen as he could , and part of his Marines .

		I sent this Letter by the Savage to Captain
-LSB- Edward -RSB- Le Cras	PERSON	at
Halifax	LOCATION	with Directions either to send that Sloop or the Hinchinbrook with it to
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, which he should find fittest for that Service .

		Last Night the
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	anchored in
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	, and I received a Letter from Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Collins	PERSON	-LRB- a Copy of which is inclosed -RRB- .

		Extremely concerned to find the Hope , with Major -LSB-
Christopher	PERSON	-RSB- French and the Cloathing of the 22d Regiment had passed the Nautilus without farther Notice than common hailing ; * tho ' Captain
Collins	PERSON	was stationed in the
Delaware	LOCATION	to strictly examine all Vessels he met with ; And dissatisfied with him for leaving his Station without Orders , because the Rebels were making preparations and boasting they would attack the Kings Ships ; for these reasons and apprehending bad consequences to his
Majestys Service	ORGANIZATION	, if such Conduct passed without publick Reprehension , I have ordered Captain
Collins	PERSON	to be forthwith tried at a Court Martial .

		The
Scarborough	PERSON	came from
Piscatagua	LOCATION	principally with a Ship which arrived there from the Grenades , the Master of whom upon being questioned said he had Guns in the Hold ; Captain
Barkley	PERSON	detained him , but it appears that this Vessel was formerly his Majesty 's Sloop Albany , upon her being sold to the Merchants was in 1771 fitted out for a Privateer , afterwards turned into a Guineaman and her Guns put into the hold with the Shot , Carriages & c , and where they are now said to remain .

		Captain
Barkley	PERSON	has libelled this Ship in the

Gage	PERSON	, lying near the Man of War , sent her Boat ashore with four Men and one Woman , who being observed by some of our People , they were all taken Prisoners and carried to the
Guard House	ORGANIZATION	; the Woman was discharged , but the Men are detained for further Examination .

		The Boat was stove to Pieces on the
Beach	LOCATION	near
Greenwich	LOCATION	, and then burnt .

		Tuesday se ` nnight a small Sloop came down the
North River	LOCATION	from a Place called Little Esopus , and anchored along side the
Asia	LOCATION	Man of War , in order 't is supposed to supply that Ship with Necessaries : A strict Watch was kept on her from that Day until Sunday Morning , when she set Sail and stood up the
River	LOCATION	, attended by an armed Sloop and some Boats from the
Asia	LOCATION	, but she was immediately pursued by a Number of Boats from the City , and soon taken , with 12 Men in her , who were committed to Gaol .

		Since our last several vessels with provisions & c. have been stopped and detained by the man of war , who put his own price upon whatever he thought proper to take ー on the other hand , several vessels which had been on board the man of war , have been seized by our people , the men examined ; some were discharged and others confined , and the vessels destroyed .

		Twelve persons from one vessel were confined and still remain so .

		Yesterday afternoon , two sloops , Captains
Holley	PERSON	and Hazard , from New Fields or
Poquanock	LOCATION	, loaded with grain , flour , provisions , and live stock , came , down the sound to this city , and having no clearance or other necessary papers to produce , were taken into custody on suspicion of being intended for
Boston	LOCATION	or to fall into the hands of the men of war .

		In their defence they said , that the committee of
Fairfield	LOCATION	knew of and did not disapprove their design ; and that the reason of their want of clearance & c. was that they could not obtain them in
Connecticut	LOCATION	, by reason of a an embargo there upon all vessels , and that they came to
New York	LOCATION	to clear out .

JAMES LIVINGSTON	PERSON	TO MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	Dear Sir ,
St Teresa Sepr	PERSON	8th 1775 .

		It is with inexpressible Regret we are under the Necessity of demanding a
Party of Men from your Army	ORGANIZATION	to cut off the necessary Communication between
St Johns & Laprairie Chamblee &	ORGANIZATION	c Your Manifesto came safe to Hand , & dispatched them off to the different Parishes with all possible Care and Expedition .

		The Canadians are all Friends and a Spirit of Freedom seems to reign amongst them .

		Col -LSB-
Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	, Major -LSB-
John -RSB- Brown	PERSON	, and myself set off this Morning with a Party of Canadians with Intention to go to your
Army	ORGANIZATION	; but we having a Party of Indians waiting for us the same Side of the
River	LOCATION	, we thought it most prudent to retire , in order if possible , to raise a more considerable Party of Men .

		The Canadians , at any Rate , are determined not to take up Arms against you , but immediately upon the Arrival of a Party from your
Army	ORGANIZATION	, I make no Doubt of joining you with a considerable Party of Canadians .

		Our Attempt in getting to your
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and the Failure thereof , has deprived me of the Honour of seeing you for the present .

		We shall drop down the River
Chamblee	PERSON	as far as my
House	ORGANIZATION	, where a Number of Canadians are waiting for me , and expect a Party of your Men before they will stir .

		I shall notwithstanding keep up a Spirit of Faction amongst them , till I can hear what Advances you are making towards a general Attack upon
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	.

		I had the pleasure of acquainting you in my former of the absolute Necessity of taking the armed Vessels at the
Mouth of Sorrel River	LOCATION	which will effectually prevent the
Escape of the Troops of Chamblee & Montreal	ORGANIZATION	going to
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		There are still Provisions and warlike
Stores on Board	ORGANIZATION	said Vessels , and apprehend the taking the same to be of as much Consequence , as blocking up the Communication between
Montreal & St Johns & c	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are but slenderly manned , and make no Doubt a Dozen of Men might take one of them without Bloodshed .

		I can easily furnish any Party you may send with what Provisions they may want .

		We wait with the utmost Impatience your Answer , till when I am with sincere Wishes for the Success of your Arms .

		Yours & c

Richard -RSB- Montgomery	PERSON	having received the enclosed Information on the 25h ult : , And being justly apprehensive , that the Enemy 's armed Vessels might get into the
Lake	LOCATION	, unless an immediate Movement was made to this Place , resolved to proceed with what Force he could carry , of which he advised me by
Express	ORGANIZATION	, which I received at
Albany	LOCATION	, where I was attending at the Indian Conference , on Sunday the 27 Ult .

		I arrived very much indisposed at
Tionderoga	LOCATION	on the 30th And left it on the 31st , after having given the proper Orders for bringing up the Artillery & c & c & c , on the 4th instant I joined General
Montgomery	PERSON	at
Isle-La-Motte	LOCATION	, where he had arrived the preceeding Day , having been detained by Adverse Winds and rainy Weather , On that Day we moved on , and arrived at this Place , And agreeable to a Request that had been made us , we fired three Cannon to give Notice to the Canadians of our Arrival , who were to collect on the Occasion .

		On the fifth , I drew a Declaration -LRB- a Copy of which is enclosed -RRB- & sent it amongst the Inhabitants , And as we judged , that going to
St Johns	PERSON	weak as we were , -LRB- our Numbers not exceeding one Thousand -RRB- might have a good Effect on the Canadians and encourage them to join Us , we resolved upon the Measure , and accordingly landed our Provisions , Baggage & ca and Early on the 6th embarked , and without any Obstruction proceeded towards
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	.

		When we arrived in Sight of and at the Distance of about two Miles , the Enemy began a Fire from their Fortress , but without doing any Damage , we approached half a Mile nearer & then landed without Opposition in a close deep Swamp , after being formed , we marched in the best Order we coud in Grounds marshy and covered with
Woods	PERSON	, in Order to approach & Reconnoitre the Fortresses .

		ー Besides these Major
Hobby	PERSON	was shot thro the Thigh , but not dangerously and
Capt Mead	PERSON	received a slight wound thro ' the Shoulder , as did
Lieut -LSB- Bezaleel -RSB- Brown	PERSON	in the Hand , Our Surviving wounded are in a fair Way of Recovery ; Night now coming on we drew our Men together , and cast up a small Intrenchment to defend Ourselves in Case of an Attack in the Night .

		ー In the Evening , a Gentleman whose Name I am not at Liberty to commit to paper , came to me and gave me the following Account , ー that there were no Regular Troops in
Canada	LOCATION	but the 26th Regiment , that all these , except fifty at
Montreal	LOCATION	, were at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	and
Chamblee	PERSON	, that there were then at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	about one hundred Indians , that there was a considerable Body with Colo : -LSB- Guy
-RSB- Johnson	PERSON	, that the Fortifications were compleat and strong and plentifully furnishd with Cannon , That The Vessel was launched & had one Mast in & the Other ready to raise ; that she would be ready to sail in three or four Days and is to carry sixteen Guns , That he does not believe that our
Army	ORGANIZATION	will be joined by one Canadian , that they wish to be neuter upon the Occasion , but if we should penetrate into
Canada	LOCATION	, it would not displease them provided their Persons and Properties were safe & we paid them in Gold and Silver for what we had ; That in the Situation we were in , he judged it would be imprudent to attack
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	& advised Us to send some Parties amongst the Inhabitants & the Remainder of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	to retire to the
Isle aux Noix	ORGANIZATION	, from whence we might have an Intercourse with
La Praire	PERSON	.

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO THE MAJOR AND BRIGADIER GENERALS Gentlemen : Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, September 8 , 1775 .

		As I mean to call upon you in a day or two for your opinions upon a point of a very Interesting nature to the well being of the Continent in general , and this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	in particular ; I think it proper , indeed an incumbent duty on me previous to this meeting , to intimate to the end and design of it , that you may have time to consider the matter with that deliberation and attention which the Importance of it requires .

		It is to know whether , in your judgment , we can not make a successful attack upon the Troops in
Boston	LOCATION	, by means of Boats , cooperated by an attempt upon their Lines at
Roxbury	LOCATION	.

		The success of such an Enterprize depends , I well know , upon the all wise disposer of Events , and is not within the reach of human wisdom to foretell the Issue ; but , if the prospect is fair , the undertaking is justifiable under the following , among other reasons which might be assigned .

		The Season is now fast approaching when warm , and comfortable Barracks must be erected for the Security of the Troops , against the inclemency of the Winter ; large and costly provision must be made in the article of Wood , for the Supply of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	; and after all that can be done in this way , it is but too probable that Fences ,
Woods	PERSON	, Orchards , and even Houses themselves , will fall Sacrifices to the want of Fuel , before the end of the Winter .

		A very considerable difficulty , if not expence , must accrue on acct .

		of Cloathing for the Men now ingaged in the Service , and if they do not inlist again , this difficulty will be Increased to an almost insurmountable degree .

		Blankets I am inform 'd are now much wanted , and not to be got , how then shall we be able to keep Soldiers to their duty , already impatient to get home , when they come to feel the Severity of Winter without proper Covering ?

		If this
Army	ORGANIZATION	should not Incline to engage for a longer term than the first of January , what then is to be the consequence , but that you must either be obliged to levy new Troops and thereby have two Setts -LRB- or partly so -RRB- in pay at the same time , or , by disbanding one set before you get the other , expose the Country to desolation , and the Cause perhaps to irretrievable Ruin .

		These things are not unknown to the Enemy , perhaps it is the very ground they are building on , if they are not waiting a reinforcement ; and if they are waiting for succours , ought it not to give a Spur to the attempt ?

		Our Powder -LRB- not much of which would be consumed in such an enterprize -RRB- without any certainty of Supply , is daily wasting .

		and to sum up the whole , in spite of every saving that can be made , the expence of supporting this
Army	ORGANIZATION	will so far exceed any Idea that was form 'd in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of it , that I do not know what will be the consequences .

		These among many other reasons which might be assigned , induce me to wish a speedy finish of the dispute ; but , to avoid these evils we are not to loose sight of the difficulties , the hazard , and the loss that may accompany the attempt , nor , what will be the probable consequences of a failure .

		That every circumstance for and against this measure may be duely weighted , that there may be time for doing of it , and nothing of this Importance resolved on but after mature deliberation , I give this previous notice of the Intention of calling you together on Monday next , at Nine o'clock , at which time you are requested to attend at head Quarters .

		It is unnecessary I am perswaded , to recommend Secrecy , as the Success of the Enterprize , -LRB- if undertaken -RRB- must depend in a great measure upon the suddenness of the stroke .

		I am with the greatest esteem , etc. 1 .

Boston	LOCATION	September 8th 1775 ー Sir , By Letters I have lately received from Governor
-LSB- Patrick -RSB- Tonyon	PERSON	, he acquaints me , that he has great Apprehensions for the Safety of
St Augustine	LOCATION	, and therefore begs any Succur that can be given him , I have some Time ago Ordered three Companies of the 16th Regiment to him , and am told by General
-LSB- James -RSB- Grant	PERSON	that a Small Vessel will secure the
Harbour	LOCATION	, a large Ship not being able to pass the Bar , and I hope you will be able to give this Assistance .

		The Rebels have Seized one Ship with Ammunition bound to

Tonyon	PERSON	is under apprehensions of others expected there , both on the Account of Government and of the Merchants .

Cambridge	LOCATION	which are said to be gone to
Canada	LOCATION	, and by way of
Newberry	PERSON	, but by that Route they may be intended for
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	; 3 I should therefore think it exceedingly necessary some small Vessel should be immediately sent to Watch their motions , and to use every Effort to Surprise , some of the Rebel Small Vessels , which would be by much the best Method to get
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	, which if the Officer should think certain , he might give Notice to the Ships of War in the Bay of Funday , and
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	may be sent by Land from

		If its your minds that we shall make provision to get the powder our deceased friend laid a plan for , I must begin in time , its difficult to get hard money , the importance of the object , I think is such that we had much better gitt three times as much as we think we shall want rather than fall short .

		Our Towns are all Destitute almost , and success in our present undertaking depends on it .

		And I can truly say that nothing in my power has been omitted .

		I wrote my deceased friend
E.P.	PERSON	the day we heard of the Battle of
Bunker Hill	LOCATION	that all the Interest I had of mine to lay out in powder , also all his own , and take up as much money on my credit as he could .

		His plan was good and by letter from my other friends they imagined he would succeed , For that reason he detained a vessel that I had sent him six weeks .

		His brother
Josiah	PERSON	is a very promising young man , and I flatter myself we shall not be deceived .

		ー have not to add only I think our armed vessells should be fitted as soon as possible .

Frost	PERSON	was master of the 200 ton ship Friendship , which had arrived at
Annapolis	LOCATION	, June 12 , 1775 , and apparently was dispatched to
London	LOCATION	after July 19 , 1775 .

		The ship
Sidney	PERSON	,
Thomas Drysdale	PERSON	, master , sailed from
Baltimore	LOCATION	December 22 , 1774 , with a cargo of wheat for
Nice	ORGANIZATION	, in the kingdom of
Sardinia	LOCATION	.

		Just after clearing the
Virginia	LOCATION	Capes , she sprung a leak and put back into
Norfolk	LOCATION	harbor , where , in order to make repairs , it was necessary to remove part of her cargo .


Drysdale	PERSON	had a dispute with the first mate , who left the ship .

		The captain 's young brother-in-law ,
Joshua Barney	PERSON	, who , at fifteen years of age , was second mate , took over the post of first mate .

		A few days after the
Sidney	PERSON	put out from
Norfolk	LOCATION	, Captain
Drysdale	PERSON	fell ill , and died within a week .

		The command passed to
Barney	PERSON	, who took the ship safely across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, but a heavy gale as they were entering the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	so damaged the
Sidney	PERSON	, that he was forced to put into
Gibraltar	LOCATION	.

		There he applied to
Murray & Son	ORGANIZATION	, and , after a survey , the ship was found to require extensive repairs .

		These took three months before the vessel was fit to proceed ; the firm of
Murray & Son	ORGANIZATION	advancing # 700 sterling for the work .


Barney	PERSON	executed a Bottomry bond to that firm for the amount , reloaded his cargo of wheat and sailed for Nice .

		Letters from
Gibraltar	LOCATION	had advised
Smith & Sons	ORGANIZATION	that the cargo was in good shape when the
Sidney	PERSON	left that port .

PURDIE	PERSON	'S
VIRGINIA	LOCATION
GAZETTE	ORGANIZATION	, FRIDAY , SEPTEMBER 8 , 1775
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, September 8 .

		It is reported , and generally believed , that Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	is called home , with what view we have not yet learned , but probably it is to render an account of his sagacious and spirited conduct in
Virginia	LOCATION	; which can hardly fail to attract the admiration of lord
North	PERSON	and the Butonian juncto , so as to have his eminent services recompensed with some higher department in the state , perhaps lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	's .

		His lordship has this satisfaction upon his departure , that he will leave the colony with the universal consent of the inhabitants , of all ranks and denominations .

		It is reported at
Norfolk	LOCATION	, that the remainder of the troops which lord
Dunmore	PERSON	expected from
St. Augustine	LOCATION	are taken and carried into
Charlestown	LOCATION	, a vessel having been fitted out from thence for the purpose .

		By a gentleman from
London	LOCATION	, who came passenger in the ship
Baltimore	LOCATION	, bound for
Maryland	LOCATION	, we learn , that a certain major
John Campbell	PERSON	, son in law to mons .


St. Luke Le Corne	PERSON	, who was the French superintendent of Indian affairs in
Canada	LOCATION	, sailed for Quebeck about the middle of May last , with 40,000 l. from government to disperse among the Canadian Indians , to induce them to fall upon the colonies ; and he is to be this fall at
Michillimachinack	LOCATION	, and the
Illinois	LOCATION	, to meet the different tribes of Indians .

		1 Every day last week it rained more or less , and sometimes continued chief part of the night ; but on saturday -LSB- September 2 -RSB- it never ceased pouring down , and towards noon the wind began to rise , which increased soon afterwards to a mere hurricane , it blowing most furiously from the N.E. till near 10 o'clock at night .

		Infinite damage has been done to the crops of corn and tobacco , much wheat spoiled in barns , a great number of trees blown down , and almost every milldam in the country given way .

		ー Capt.
Robertson	PERSON	and capt.
M'Cunn	PERSON	, both lying at
York	LOCATION	town , bound for
London	LOCATION	, and laden with tobacco , were drove ashore , and must unload before they can be got off ; but the
Prospect	ORGANIZATION	,
Norwood	LOCATION	, likewise for
London	LOCATION	, with tobacco , had the good fortune to ride out the storm , and has received no injury .

		At
Norfolk	LOCATION	, all the small craft were drove ashore , besides some ships , which have been chiefly got off , except the Mercury man of war , capt. -LSB-
John -RSB- M'Cartney	PERSON	, who lies in two feet water only ; and there may he stick fast , fast !

		ー Capt -LSB-
Matthew -RSB- Squires	PERSON	, of the Otter sloop , going round to
York	LOCATION	in his tender , had very near perished in the storm , being cast away upon Back river , near
Hampton	LOCATION	; where his vessel was burnt by the people thereabouts , in return for his harbouring gentlemen 's negroes , and suffering his sailors to steal poultry , hogs , & c. Two of the crew were runaway slaves from col.
Wilson Miles Cary	PERSON	's quarters in King & Queen , who were taken soon after they got ashore ; and his pilot , a mulatto man , was the property of
Henry King	PERSON	, esq ; of
Hampton	LOCATION	, with whom , after skulking in the woods about 48 hours , he found means to paddle off in a canoe .

		From
Hampton	PERSON	we learn , that they begin to receive melancholy accounts of the loss of lives , & c. in the late storm .

		Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	's vessel , of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, was castaway , and every soul on board perished , except the master and a boy .

		Two ships from
Ireland	LOCATION	are likewise lost .

		Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, we hear , keeps cruising about , and at the time of the storm was up in

NICHOLSON BROUGHTON	PERSON	TO GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	Sir As there is several Matters of Complaint turnd up -LRB- since my Capture of the Ship Unity -RRB- against the Capt of sd Ship , I think proper to acquaint you of the Particulars , viz as follows ー On my sending of an Officer on Board Sd Ship , his Treatment was such as I would rather have expected from a polite Enemy than a Friend to our Cause as Americans ー I would acquaint your Excellency in the next Place , that there is on
Board	ORGANIZATION	said Ship a much greater
Quantity of Naval Stores	ORGANIZATION	than is customary to export from our Ports ー There is likewise as I understand some considerable Quantity of Provisions , much more -LRB- in my Opinion -RRB- than is necessary for Ship 's Crew .

		I would likewise inform your Excellency that the Capt contrary to the Resolves of our
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	has taken on Board a Considerable Quantity of raw Fish .

		And from those , And many other Circumstances , I conclude that
Capt Flagg	PERSON	, was designd for the Port of
Boston	LOCATION	instead of any one of the
West India Isles	LOCATION	ー From this Consideration Sir , I -LRB- with the greatest Deference to your own Judgement -RRB- should think it proper , that the ship should be remov 'd to
Beverly	LOCATION	, as a Place of much greater Security , than her present Port ; the Lumber which she has on
Board	ORGANIZATION	is considerable & might be much easier remov 'd to Head Quarters , for Service , from thence , than the present Port ー I shall leave the Ship with the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	, 'till further Orders ー With the greatest Respect , I am Sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB-

I would not neglect acquainting Your Excellency -LRB- in Excuse for my making a Short Stay Here , -RRB- that my first Lieuftenant Was accidentally wounded ; for the Particulars of which , or the Circumstances relative to my takeing the Ship , your Excellency will be pleased to inquire of the Bearer ー Gloucester Sepr 9th 1775 1 .

NICHOLAS COOKE	PERSON	TO GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	Sir Providence Septemr 9th 1775 .

		I am to acknowledge the Receipt of your Excellency 's ー Letter of the 6th instant , and to inform you that , Zealous to do every Thing in our Power to serve the common cause of
America	LOCATION	, the
ー Committee	ORGANIZATION	have determined , instead of the small armed Sloop , to send the large Vessel with Fifty Men upon the
Bermuda Enterprise	ORGANIZATION	; with Orders to Capt.
-LSB- Abraham -RSB- Whipple	PERSON	to cruize Ten Days off Sandy-Hook for the Packet expected from
England	LOCATION	; and if he is so fortunate as to meet her to put the Letters ashore at
South-Hampton	LOCATION	and send them by Express to your Excellency .

		ー She will sail Wind and Weather permitting the Beginning of the Week .

		There is in this Town a Mr
Du Ville	PERSON	, a Frenchman , who hath made several Voyages from this Port during the last Four or Five Years , and is esteemed a Person every Way well qualified , and to be depended upon , for the Execution of the Plan he proposes .

		He was with Capt. -LSB-
John Burroughs -RSB- Hopkins	PERSON	the last Voyage when he imported the Ammunition & c lately purchased of
Messrs Clark & Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	; and hath brought with him a Set of Papers to qualify a Brigt as a French Bottom .

		ー His Scheme is to proceed to
Bayonne	LOCATION	in
France	LOCATION	, where he is well acquainted , and there take in a Load of Powder , which he says can be effected in Three Days .

		This Dispatch will be so great that intelligence of the Vessel can not be sent to
England	LOCATION	timely enough for any Measures to be taken to intercept her upon her Return .

		ー I think the Plan practicable and likely to be attended with Success .

		ー We have here a Brig , a fast
Sailer	PERSON	, and otherwise a suitable Vessel for the Voyage , which will bring about Eighty Tons : And we will undertake to fit One Quarter of her , and to supply the Money to purchase One Quarter Part of that Quantity of Powder ; which is the most we can do here .

		I have written to Governor -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Trumbull	PERSON	upon this Subject , and desired him , if the Plan meets with his Approbation , to dispatch a trusty Person to confer with you upon it , who can return through
Providence	LOCATION	and let me know the Result , so that we may immediately aquip the Vessel for the Voyage .

		I have communicated to
Messrs Clark	PERSON	& Nightingale ー that Part of your Letter which related to them .

		They desire me to present to you their respectful Thanks for the polite Notice you have taken of them .

		CAPTAIN
JAMES WALLACE	PERSON	, R.N. , TO VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES -LRB- Copy -RRB- Rose Rhode Island Septr 9th 1775 .

		Sir , Intelligence being given me that the Assembly of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	had passed an Act for taking the Stock off the
Islands	LOCATION	with intent to prevent the
Kings Forces	ORGANIZATION	from being Supplied , I wrote the inclosed Letter to the Town of
Newport	LOCATION	to prevent -LRB- if possible -RRB- their giving any Assistance .

		And as I was informed at the same time 250 Men were at
Stonytown	LOCATION	ready to embark to
Block Island	LOCATION	for that purpose ー I got under way the 29th Ulto with His Majesty 's Ship Rose , Tender md two Sloops whom I manned in Order to prevent them -LRB- leaving the
Glasgow	LOCATION	at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	-RRB- ー About 7 o'Clock PM I saw a Sloop and Schooner off
Block Island	LOCATION	, gave
Chace	PERSON	, lost them in the dark .

		Next Morning the 30th the Tenders Chaced these Vessels into
Stonytown	LOCATION	, the Tenders returned and acquainted me , the Town fired upon them .

		We stood in , the Tenders going ahead .

		One of the Tenders attempting to board a Vessel , a firing begun from the Town , the Tenders returned it , about this time we came to an Anchor off the South end of the Town ー the Tender and the Town continuing the fire , About 10 Minutes after we were at an Anchor we received three or four Musket Shot from the Windmill , right abreast the Ship about 2 Cables and half distant , upon which I ordered one of our Guns to be fired into the Town , and waited some time expecting that would put a stop to it ー They took no Notice but continued firing from all parts of the Town ー Then we began and fired about 120 Shot during which time they sent off to me two Letters -LRB- which I send inclosed with my Answers -RRB- we took every Vessel that was afloat from the W arves , Consisting of a Schooner from
Surinam	LOCATION	loaded with Molasses and Sugar , a Schooner that was Employed carrying the Rebels over to
Block Island	LOCATION	to take the Stock , in this Vessel they left a Drum , two Firelocks and some Haversacks ー a Schooner with
Hay	PERSON	and two Sloops , they ceasing fire about an hour after we weighed and came further out in Company with the Vessels .

		At the beginning of this Action there was about 300 Rebels in the Town , at the latter end more than 3,000 Skulking behind
Hills	LOCATION	and Rocks and fences .

		All the Country about came in , We had three Men Wounded , ca n't learn what damage is done the Town .

		ー
New London	LOCATION	and all the Coast is greatly alarmed and 500 Rebels were stop 'd , that were under Orders for the Camp .

		On the 4th instant Arrived at
Newport	LOCATION	the Governor returned me the inclosed Answer from the Town to mine of the the 28th of August ー it appears by this Town Meeting the late transactions have had such an effect as to almost destroy the Rebel faction , they passed a Vote to have nothing to do with the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and not to be concerned in taking away the Stock from the
Islands	LOCATION	in consequence of which upwards of 40 Rebel families have leit the Town .

		The 8th Arrived here the Swan from Convoying a
Brigg	LOCATION	clear of the
Islands	LOCATION	.

		We have just got an Account that one of the Schooners loaded with
Hay	PERSON	we took at
Stonytown	LOCATION	and who parted from us in a gale of Wind off
Fishers Island	LOCATION	is seized at
New London	LOCATION	and the people made Prisoners .

		The 30th Ulto the day or the day after the Nautilis Sailed from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	three Vessels Arrived there , one from
Bermuda	LOCATION	belonging to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	which had broke open in the Night and taken out of the Magazine of that Island 126 Barrels of Gunpowder , One from
So Carolina	LOCATION	with a quantity of Powder taken from a Storeship bound to Saint Augustine the third from

New York	LOCATION	9th of Sept. 1775 Will you do me the favour to contradict a paragraph in Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's paper , in which he says that the man of war had stopped several vessels with provisions , and that we had set our own price upon whatsoever we chose to take ?

		2 The truth is , that we have not taken or bought any sort of provisions from any vessel , except three hundred oysters which I bought yesterday , and for which I gave the owner two shillings more than what he told me was the market price .

		The transport has , I believe , got a few fowls and ducks for their sea stock , not being able to procure any from the shore ; but I am well assured , that whatever price was asked for them , was paid , and that the officer in the transport has receipts for whatever few things he has bought .

		I should not have taken notice of this , as I scarcely suppose any one who knows me would believe it ; but I think it would be blame-worthy in any one not to contradict any such report , which , if credited , might serve to inflame .

SAMUEL MORRIS	PERSON	TO
CADWALADER MORRIS	PERSON	-LSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RSB- Septemr 9th 1775 I have now wrote by every Vessel that I have heard was going to your port those going this day -LRB- the last upon which any can go to the
West Indies	LOCATION	-RRB- affords me the only Oppoys I may for a long time have of writing you ー the resolutions of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will be most sacredly kept , and shou 'd any one offer to break thro ' them , the popular Vengeance will be shewn in an exemplary manner ー this I mention to convince you that no Island British or Foreign will from this day be supplied with any comodities of this Country , untill the present Controversy is ended .

		ー I am to the last degree distressed at the prospect that presents itself at the present Crisis ; it is perhaps as important as ever was agitated , and big with consequences that may involve a great Empire in the most inextricable difficulties .

		ー the Suspension of Trade with every part of the World will be attended with the most terrible Effects , and Plunge thousands who once lived in Affluence into the most poignant distress , ー this great City will sensibly feel it ; and what to do with those who have always maintained themselves by their daily labour is very difficult to say ー some Employments must be found out for them , but of what nature is yet to be determined on ー Upon this very day have a whole Continent .

		shut up all their Trade and by this Step will Convince the World that they will Sacrafice everything in defence of the rights of Freemen ー since the Creation of the World there has never been perhaps a more remarkable union in so large a Country and of so great a Number of People ; by the lowest Calculations not less than three Millions ー and is it to be supposed they will tamely surrender up their rights to any power on Earth believe me they will not , and whatever you may hear of disunion do not attend to it as there is not one in a thousand in this Continent but will stake his Life in the Contest .

		ー We have good information that
Genl Schuyler	PERSON	has before this time proceeded to the Reduction of
St. Johns	LOCATION	with 7000 Men ー this is the Key of
Canada	LOCATION	and if he succeeds , the Way will be open to
Montreal	LOCATION	and the Reduction of all
Canada	LOCATION	must inevitably follow
ー Genl Carlton	ORGANIZATION	has an
Army	ORGANIZATION	at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	and
Genl Schuyler	PERSON	it -LSB- is -RSB- imagined will have a bloody piece of Work of it before it is accomplished ー the Regulars have not above 1000 there but strongly fortifyed ー we now daily look for Intelligence from that Quarter .

		ー but as after this day no Vessells will go for your Island , you will not be acquainted with any of our proceedings ー this is Saturday and on Monday we shall not have 10 Sea Vessells in Port ー the purchase of Flour , wheat & ca .

		is now ceased and the Price is now down to nothing ー the Country People offer it on any Terms even at 11 / or 12 / .

		and everything else in proportion ー Corn 2 / .

		wheat 4 / or 5 / .

		but no purchasers appear .

		ー Mr.
Cuthbert	PERSON	carries this , going in Shield 's old
Brig	LOCATION	consigned himself ー Mr
Morris	PERSON	's Brig is gone to
Windward ー Howell & Douglass	ORGANIZATION	's Brig is supposed will be lost and the
Cesar	PERSON	,
Miller	PERSON	, will not get away for sometime being entirely unloaded at
Reedy Island	LOCATION	.

		ー 2 I wish I cou 'd inform you of some Vessells to your Address ー but there is none ー I am half Mad at the Circumstance and hardly dare to trust myself with Thinking on it ー you must be as calm as possible as it will be to no purpose to fret ー I preach philosophy to you but do not practice it myself .

		ー I confess it hurts me more than I can describe to see so many Vessells going out and none to your Shore .

		ー I can not help thinking rather hardly of two Houses here who have always flattered you with great support ー I must think it cruel and especially at a time when there was so good a prospect of a Market .

		ー I tremble at the Consequences of these Matters , but can not paint my feelings so sensibly as you may easily conceive them to be on these most alarming occasions .

		ー Our Good Father now writes you also , the last perhaps that he may for a long time have an Oppo of writing you and informs you that we are all well .

		3 ー there is only one matter that may possibly keep open some kind of a communication between your Island & us , but it is a way that notwithstanding all its Risks will be adopted by some adventurous Spirits amongst us .

		ー it is this the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	well considering that every Incouragment ought to be given to the Importation of Powder into the Colonies has agreed that every Importer of that Article shall be allowed a profit of # 4 P hundred weight and have the Liberty of Exporting the Value of any quantity thereof in the Produce of this Country to the Country or Island from whence he has brought it ー this with all Risks will be attempted as the Encouragement is great and the prospect of a market to any of the
Islands	LOCATION	after a little time will be much greater .

		ー this Intelligence you may Rely on ー Jos.
Whitall	PERSON	told me of it and I believe will make some bold attempts towards affecting it ー I wish something of the kind cou 'd be adopted by you in conjunction with some persons of capital in your Place .


ー Willing & Morris	ORGANIZATION	in this Place wou 'd be the best
House	ORGANIZATION	to send it to here , as Mr. R -LSB- obert -RSB-
Morris	PERSON	is one of the foremost in the Cause and wou 'd do everything in his power to Effect it ー however it is worth thinking of ー I am pressed for time as the Vessells will be going in a few Hours and I must send a Copy of this by
Blowers Brig	ORGANIZATION	in case of Miscarriage ー Adieu ー My Love to
Tommy	PERSON	& Beleive me always Your most affe Brother

		ー A Good Correspondent , in some of the French or Spanish Setlements coud Mannage the purchase of such quantity of the Powder as might be ordered from time to time , and am confident , the Advantage derived from such schemes woud prove an Object of Attention .

		Because , in the first Place , a very handsome Price is already fixed on , to be given for the Article wanted here , to encourage Adventurer 's , -LSB- & -RSB- the State of your own wants in the Provision way , must determine what prospect of Advantage can be lookt for from the Return 's ー The success depends in a great Measure on the prudence & Mannagement of the Master of the Vessell .

		It will be only Necessary to keep clear of any Ships of War and how soon the Pilate can be got on Board , Let him request of the Pilate to carry him to the first place of Safety -LRB- as

Committee	ORGANIZATION	of any of the Provinces , or Countys , he can first meet , And upon giveing them information of his Cargo , they will immediately receive it on Accot of the Public , and give the Captain Receipt for the quantity delivered .

		ー which Receipt he is to forward , or Bring to me , to enable me to get the Money ー I wou 'd not advise you to lose time in the Prosecution of this Plan shou 'd you be disposed to Risque , At same time shoud you decline takeing any concern in this way ー do n't Make an improper use of this Part of my Correspondence .

		I beg your Sentiments however as soon as Possible for my government .

		ー if it engages you -LSB- r -RSB- Attention , You might
Possibley	LOCATION	with prudence , Purchase or procure out of the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	stores about a hundred -LRB- or 150 . -RRB-

		Barrels , as if for some other scheme , And in a private Manner , dispatch some small Vessell immadiately therewith .

		ー The returns coud be sent in a Larger , as soon as it came to hand .

		ー Much Mannagement & secressie is Necessary in the Execution of this business ー That being the case , the Purchase should be Made in Smals -LRB- & at certain Periods -RRB- to guard against every possible suspicion ... I hope to have some liberty to Export in the Course of the Winter , and Shoud your situation encourage me , my attention shall in great Measure be governed by your return to this .

		ー Wish however it suited you to adopt the Plan herein described , the Plan favouring of Mutual advantage , in case the Present contest shoud prove Lasting ... I beg your Views may be conducted Privately and executed immadiatly after this gets to hand , Particularly if you shoud find it Practicable , to accomplish any of the purchase in your Island .

		ー Posibley before the Ariveal of such Adventure as you may engage in , I may have it in my Power to cover your Interest & my own , if timeous Notice should come to my hand .

		AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHARLES BIDDLE -LSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, September 9 -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	had declared that , if the British Acts of Parliament they complained of were not repealed by this day , they would not , after it , export anything whatever to
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, or the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		It was a very fine day .

		The river covered with ships and the wharves crowded with inhabitants was a pleasant sight , if you could look at it without reflecting on the occasion that drove the country into the measure .

		Several of the vessels had arrived but a few days before , two or three only the day before .

		They were unloaded and loaded with great dispatch ー they had as many hands as could work night and day .

		It would , perhaps , have been better policy in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to have prohibited any trade to
Great Britain	LOCATION	or her possessions .

		We should then have kept many a gallant seaman that sailed in this fleet and never returned to
America	LOCATION	; for many of the vessels were sold abroad , and the crews not being able to return were obliged to enter into foreign service .

		2 The trade should have been stopped , or the owners obliged to bring back the crews they sent out .

		I went to town , the day after the fleet sailed , on business ; the wharf was clear of everything except a few melancholy looking people .

Addison	PERSON	and his younger son , and a Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	from
Annapolis	LOCATION	-LRB- attended also to the ship by my wife 's younger brother and my sister -RRB- we left the Lodge , amidst the tears and cries of our slaves , and went on board a small schooner called the
Nell Gwyn	PERSON	.

		Our accomodations here were but bad , and such , as I told my poor wife , as were , I feared , too ominous of the hardships she was about to encounter .

		She and I slept , I remember , on one .

		of the miserable bunkers in the miserable cabin , with a piece of an old sail for our coverlid , and a small bag of hominy for our pillow ... After a day and a night spent in this vessel we reached our destined ship , the
Choptank	LOCATION	frigate , then lying off
Quantico	LOCATION	.

		Here we stayed one day ; and nothing material happened to us , save that here our two friends ,
Jack Addison	PERSON	and my sister , took their leave of us .

		At the mouth of the
Potomac	LOCATION	we stayed several days , and went often ashore , and were hospitably and genteely entertained by Mr.
Wolstenholme	PERSON	.

		At length the wind came fair , and we sailed with a fine fresh breeze down the
Chesapeak	LOCATION	; and on the 20th of the month , just about sunset , in a charmingly fine evening , we lost sight of the capes of

		In the heavy storm of wind and rain , which came on last Saturday -LSB- September 2 -RSB- , and continued most part of the night , the Mercury man of war was drove from her station abreast of the town of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, and stuck fast aground in shoal water ; it is thought she will not be got off without a great deal of trouble .

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO JOHN AUGUSTINE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	Dear Brother : Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, September 10 , 1775 .

		So little has happened since the date of my last , that I should scarce have given you the trouble of reading this Letter , did I not imagine that it might be some satisfaction to you to know that we are well and in no fear or dread of the Enemy .

		Being , in our own opinion at least , very securely Intrenched , and wishing for nothing more than to see the Enemy out of their strong holds , that the dispute may come to an Issue .

		The inactive state we lye in is exceedingly disagreeable , especially as we can see no end to it , having had no advices lately from
Great Britain	LOCATION	to form a judgment upon .

		In taking possession about a fortnight ago , of a
Hill	LOCATION	within point blank -LRB- Cannon -RRB- shott of the Enemy 's Lines on
Charles Town Neck	LOCATION	we expected to bring on a general Action , especially as we had been threatened by reports from
Boston	LOCATION	several days before , that they -LRB- that is the Enemy -RRB- intended an Attack upon our Intrenchments , nothing , however , followed but a severe Cannonade for a day or two , and a Bombardment afterwards for the like time ; which , however , did us no other damage , than to kill two or three men , and wound as many more .

		Both are now at an end , as they found that we disregarded their Fire and continued our Works 'till we had got them compleated .

		Unless the Ministerial Troops in
Boston	LOCATION	are waiting for reinforcements , I can not devise what they are staying there after ; and why -LRB- as they affect to despise the Americans , -RRB- they do not come forth , and put an end to the contest at once .

		They suffer greatly for want of fresh Provisions , notwithstanding they have pillaged several Islands of a good many Sheep and Cattle .

		They are also scarce of Fuel , maless , -LRB- according to the acct .

		of one of their Deserters , -RRB- they mean to pull down Houses for Firing .

		In short , they are , from all accts .

		suffering all the Inconveniences of a Siege .

		It is true , by having the entire Command of the Sea , and a powerful
Navy	ORGANIZATION	; and moreover , as they are now beginning to take all Vessells indiscriminately , we can not stop their Supplies through that Channel ; but their Succours in this way hath not been so powerful as to enable them to give the Common Soldiers much fresh meat as yet .

		By an Acct .

		from
Boston	LOCATION	of the 4th Instt .

		the Cattle lately brought in there , sold at publick auction from Fifteen to # 34.10
Sterg	PERSON	.

		apiece ; and the Sheep from 30 / to 36 / each ; and that Fowls and every other Species of Fresh Provisions went in proportion .

		The expence of this , one would think , must soon tire them were it not that they intend to fix all the Expence of this War upon the Colonies , if they can , I suppose we shall add .

		I am just sending off a Detachment of 1000 Men to
Quebec	LOCATION	, by the way of
Kennebec River	LOCATION	, to co-operate with General
Schuyler	PERSON	who by this is , I expect , at or near
St. Johns	LOCATION	, on the
North end of Lake Champlain	LOCATION	; and may , for ought I know have determined the Fate of his
Army	ORGANIZATION	and that of
Canada	LOCATION	, as he left Crown point the 31st of last Month for the Isle-au-Noix , -LRB- within 12 Miles of
St. Johns	LOCATION	, where Govr .


Carleton	PERSON	's principal force lay . -RRB-

		If he should succeed there , he will soon after be in
Montreal	LOCATION	without opposition ; and if the Detachment I am sending -LRB- though late in the season , -RRB- from hence should be able to get possession of
Quebec	LOCATION	, the Ministrys Plan , in respect to that Government will turn out finely .

		I have only to add my love to my Sister and the little ones , and that I am with the greatest truth , Dr. Sir Yr .

H.M.S. SENEGAL	LOCATION	Whereas there is great Reason to apprehend the Rebels will make a Descent upon some part of

Mechias	LOCATION	they have a Number of Pyrate Vessels fitted and armed , which may either serve to cover an Embarkation or take and destroy Vessels trading to the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	; And whereas it is requisite that the utmost Care should be taken to prevent Attempts upon any part of Nova Scotia : You are hereby required and directed , notwithstanding any former Orders , to remain in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	for the protection of our Vessels trading there and for the Security of the Province of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	; And you are for these purposes to cruize off
Mechias	LOCATION	and between
Pasamaquody	LOCATION	and Grand Menan And in the Passage , which ever you think the most likely place to intercept the Rebel Vessels , but you are at Liberty to proceed to
Annapolis	LOCATION	or
Windsor	LOCATION	, or to any other part of the
Bay	LOCATION	, as you shall see best for the
King 's Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		When you are in Want of Provisions you are to repair to

Halifax	LOCATION	in his Majs Ships under your Command the ensuing Winter , as well for the purposes already mentioned as for the defence and protection of his Majs Yard and Stores against any Designs of the Rebels , and as much as in you lies for the Security of the whole province ; And whereas for the above reasons I think it will be for the Honor and good of His Majesty 's Service that you should wear a distinguishing Pendant , while you are employ 'd upon a Service of so much importance to the Nation : You are therefore hereby required and directed to hoist and wear a broad Pendant on board his Majs Ship Somerset until further Order , or until you leave the Coast of

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO CAPTAIN
GEORGE VANDEPUT	PERSON	,
H.M.S. ASIA	LOCATION	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	10 September 1775 , Sir Your Account of the Cannon being taken from the saluting Battery at
New York	LOCATION	, the death of one of your Boats Crew , and your firing upon the Town , gives me very great Concern .

		I can not at present determine upon the propriety of your Conduct in this Affair , but must immediately advert to the probable consequences of it ; And some of these will be the withholding Supplies of Provisions from the Kings Ships and using every secret and perhaps op -LSB- en -RSB- means to destroy or injure them .

		Should this be the case , I would have you acquaint the Mayor of
New York	LOCATION	for the Information of its Inhabitants that as his Majesty has been pleased to order a part of his Fleet to be stationed there for the protection of his dutiful and loyal Subjects and their property , and to support legal
Authority	ORGANIZATION	, I hope they will take Care that it receives no insult , and that the proper persons be not hindered or molested in furnishing such Supplies of Provisions as shall be required for the Kings Ships as usual .

		If provisions are sent without further trouble I shall be happy ; If on the contrary you find that by threats or persuasion , the Contractors Agent does not supply , and that pretences are formed to evade without giving a positive Denial ; you are again to acquaint the Mayor that I do insist upon his Majesty 's Ships receiving every Supply of Provisions they may want , paying for them at the customary reasonable Rates .

		And in Order to take away all pretences for refusing to furnish you with provisions , if the Contractors Agent does not serve the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, you are at liberty to contract with any other person or persons for that purpose on the usual terms , or at such a reasonable advance as these unfortunate times make absolutely necessary .

		And you are accordingly to draw
Bills of Exchange	ORGANIZATION	on the Commissioners for victualling his Majesty 's
Navy	ORGANIZATION	for the amount of all such provisions as shall be so purchased and received on Board : It 's being delivered on board in good Order to be the condition of payment .

		But if notwithstanding this moderation on your part they obstinately refuse to supply the Kings Ships , you are to send to the Mayor an Account of such Provisions as will then be necessary to compleat your proportion to four Months at whole allowance for your Complement , giving him Twenty four hours to return an Answer whether the Demand shall be complied with or not , and fix the third day for receiving the provisions and no longer .

		And you are also to inform him that if your requisition is not punctually attended to that at the expiration of the third day you will begin to fire upon the Town .

		Should Supplies be still withheld you are hereby required and directed to fire upon the House of that Traitor , -LSB-
Isaac -RSB- Sears	PERSON	, which I am told stands very conspicuous , and beat it down , to convince the Inhabitants you will put your Threats into Execution .

		And it being uncertain what Effect this Proceeding may have upon the Inhabitants , you are to provide against the worst by shortening your mens allowance of Provisions and keeping your Ship in the best condition possible for Action , least the City of
New York	LOCATION	should prefer you as Enemies rather than friends and fellow Subjects ; and in case they oppose , and endeavour by firing from the Shore or from Shipping to distress or annoy you , or preparations are discovered to be making for that purpose ; You are to intreat them to desist , and upon a Refusal take the speediest and most effectual methods in your power for your own Safety .

		And at first these I think will be to burn or sink every Vessel of consequence near to or about the Town , to suffer none to pass up or down the
River	LOCATION	, and , if it is possible to distinguish the Houses of Rebels , from those well affected to Government , to destroy them .

		I sincerely hope there will be no necessity for such severe usage .

		I trust the Inhabitants of
New York	LOCATION	will no longer suffer a few wicked Men to usurp the Government of , and bring destruction upon , the City and its Inhabitants ; but , let what will be the Event , his Majesty shall not be refused supplies where 't is possible for his Fleet to command them .

		Supposing matters to be driven to Extremeties aforedescribed , your own discretion must govern your proceedings afterwards .

		Keep your Station as long as possible , as I shall send you another Ship soon , but should anything unforseen oblige you to leave the River you are to repair to
Boston	LOCATION	and either leave or not the smaller Ships on the Station as his Majesty 's Service may be best promoted .

		I am & c

THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	TO LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- -LRB- Copy -RRB-
Boston	LOCATION	10th September 1775 ー My Lord , I have had the honor to receive your Lordships letter of the 22d August , and another without date by Mr -LSB-
John -RSB- Connolly	PERSON	, and am sorry to find you are still in so disagreeable a Situation , and heartily wish it was in my Power to give you that assistance you want .

		Your Lordship is the best Judge , as to the probability you may have of raising Provincial Troops ; should you have such athing in your Power , I do n't doubt , Government will gladly defray your Expence : At present I can neither assist you with Men , Money , Arms or Ammunition , for I have them not to Spare ; should you draw upon me I have not Cash to pay your Bills , and I have found it difficult to gather as much Money as would Pay the Subsistence of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and that at a very great loss in Exchange .

		I daily expect Money from
England	LOCATION	, but no more than will defray the Subsistence , and Contingent expences of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and very small Sums will in future be had for Bills here .

		The Detachment of the 14th Regiment is so formed and Employed here , that they ca n't at present be Spared , and if they could they would be to your Lordship but as Marines , as I understand from the Situation of affairs in
Virginia	LOCATION	, and from what Mr
Connoly	PERSON	tells me that there is no probability of landing the Men , there being no Fort or Strong hold to throw themselves into , and having neither Cannon or Ammunition .

		As for the Remainder of the 14th Regiment at
St Augustine	LOCATION	, they will not be able to leave it , without they are Relieved by three Companies of the 16th Regiment , I have long since Ordered there from
Pensacola	LOCATION	, but I have as yet had no Answer to my letter .

		I would willingly send your Lordship a Transport , but at present there is scarce any unemployed , they are gon various ways in search of Subsistence for the
Garrison	PERSON	, so that it is impossible now to spare one : I have had Applications from other Provinces Similar to your Lordships , but never have been able to Comply with them ; as you have lately sent a Vessel home , and I suppose Represented your Situation : I hope you will soon from thence have the Assistance you want , and which , I am very sorry is not in my Power to give You , for I am not supplied in the manner your Lordship may Imagine ... The Troops with your Lordship are to be fed by the Contractors from
St Augustine	ORGANIZATION	; and any person your Lordship may appoint for that purpose must draw on the Contractors for Pay , who will not Pay you may be assured , if the Ration amounts to more than is allowed by Government ; In case of difficulties , and where no Provision is to be had we must do as well as we can , but I am not allowed to purchase a single Ration , no Commissary is now Employed to feed the Troops , they are only to see the Contracts put in Execution .

		I can not sufficiently express how much I am pleased that we were so fortunate as to intercept them .

		The Brig Seaflower shall undergo the severest Scrutiny , but as the
Court of Admiralty	ORGANIZATION	, with which and a Customhouse , we are yet plagued , takes Cognizance of Breaches of Acts of Trade only , what can be done , after she is cleared , but to detain her ?

		The

		Provisions are also coming .

		I intend you shall have the

		The Store Ship so long expected is not yet arrived ; We are in want of many kinds of Stores , as well as Slops , Beds and Paper , which is the reason you have not been furnished with what was demanded ; however let me know all the wants of your little

Wood and Cattle	ORGANIZATION	, Sheep & c. Take from the Rebels when and where you can ; but we will pay for every thing we have from known friends to Government .

		The
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	will be in want of Wood , can you command a Quantity ?

		I am told many Vessels pass to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	laden , and that the Town now contains a great deal ; it will give me much pleasure to find it so , for otherwise it is difficult to say where we shall get that necessary Article .

		But I must in confidence acquaint you that the Gen_eral and I intend next month to send you agreat many Transports , that , with some additional Force I shall also send , you may make a general Sweep from all the
Islands	LOCATION	, or wherever you can command , therefore I would not wish the loading the two Transports should prejudice what we meditate : Indeed I think with your usual management you may fill these for the Squadron without much noise ; Send me what information you can of the Quantities of provisions and fuel you think we could procure by force or purchase this Winter , and whether
Block Island	LOCATION	or any other of the
Islands	LOCATION	can be so guarded all the Winter that our Stock may graze secure from the Rebels .

		It is said General -LSB-
Charles -RSB- Lee	PERSON	is gone to
Canada	LOCATION	, some say to
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		By intercepted Letters -LRB- Copy of one I inclose -RRB- we find that 7000 men are gone to
Canada	LOCATION	, that the whole province , Indians and all , are against us , and that that whole Country will be in the Rebels possession by the end of April ; so sanguine are their Expectations !

		All their Letters agree that no Vessel will sail from the Continent after the 10th instant , so that I suppose a great many have already sailed .

		We have brought in many outward bound with Lumber , Horses , Fish & c. I will appoint some Vessel to cruize in the Sound the moment it is in my power .

		In the mean time attend to the information I send you of Vessels from abroad for
Newbury Port	LOCATION	and
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	, which it seems are the favourite places for Vessels to push for .

		Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	has had the misfortune to have one of his men shot , in alarming the
Asia	LOCATION	upon the Rebels stealing the Guns from the saluting Battery .

		And he fired from the Ship , not I think to any great effect .

		This I apprehend has produced on their part a prohibition of supplying his Majestys Ships .

		I will have them furnished where it is to be had and they can command it , and have accordingly sent Captain Vandeput Orders to that Effect ; therefore if he sends for assistance , you are to give him all in your pawer .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO SAMUEL HOLLAND Sir
Preston	PERSON	at
Boston	ORGANIZATION	12 Sepr 1775 Your Letter of the 27th of July , delivered to me this day , confirms my Opinion that we are risquing the Loss of all your Drawings , Plans , Instruments & c , and perhaps the Liberty if not the Lives of all concerned by continuing to prosecute the business of the Survey you are employ 'd on : I have therefore ordered Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	to receive on board the
Asia	LOCATION	all your Instruments , Plans , Drawings , Charts & c for their Security , in Order that the Publick may not lose the Benefit of your Labours purchased at so considerable an Expence .

		It is impossible for me to spare the Canceaux , But Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	is ordered upon your Requisition to give you every Assistance he can in getting your things on board , & also to receive such of the Gentlemen and People employed on the Survey as may prefer being secure in the Kings Ship to remaining among the Rebels .

		It is of very great consequence to send the abovemention 'd Valuables immediately on board the
Asia	LOCATION	.

		You may assure yourself that Affairs are growing worse , and that hostilities will not continue to be carried so partially as at present .

		When all your Matters are safe on board the
Asia	LOCATION	they can be removed at
Leizure	LOCATION	; and I shall gladly suit your Convenience in that or any thing in my Power .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	Sir
Preston Boston Sepr	PERSON	12 , 1775 .

		By Captain -LSB-
David -RSB- Pryce	PERSON	of his Majesty 's Sloop Viper , who arrived here the 6th instant from
England	LOCATION	, I have received their Lordships Order May 20 , 1775 , to send a Reinforcement of Ships and Vessels to Rear Admiral
Duff	PERSON	upon his application , their Lordships Order June 20 Duplicate to take the Viper under my
Command	ORGANIZATION	, your Letter June 24 on the subject of Press Warrants , with a List of such Captains and Commanders of his Majestys Ships and Vessels for whom Sixty seven Press Warrants are made out , and which number I have received , with four instructions , and some blank Press Warrants to be filled up and delivered as the Service may require ; Your Letter the 24 inclosing an Act passed the last Session of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, wherein a Clause of the 6th of Queen
Anne	PERSON	is repealed which forbid the impressing of Seamen in
America	LOCATION	; And a Copy of a Letter from Mr
Grant	PERSON	the Contractor concerning the furnishing provisions to his
Majesty 's Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under my
Command	ORGANIZATION	in
North America	LOCATION	.

		I beg leave in this place generally to say that the utmost Attention and Obedience shall he paid to all their Lordships Commands signified to me in the several Orders and Letters abovementioned and I will endeavour to reply as distinctly to each as possible .

		And first with regard to Press Warran -LSB- ts . -RSB-

		I flatter myself that although we have missed no opportunity of getting Seamen , yet they have been constantly taken with that Moderation , and the Officers have so studiously avoided distressing any legal Trade , that neither their Lordships or the Parties immediately concerned will ever be troubled on that head .

		I am exceedingly happy however in receiving their Lordships authority for manning the Fleet by pressing , and I am satisfied it will give no small pleasure to the Captains and Lieutenants to whom I shall distribute the Warrants as the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	may require : Such of them as from death or Removals of the Officers they are directed to , are become null , I shall not fail to send home by the first opportunity of a Kings Ship .

		His Majesty 's gracious intention to indulge the province of
New York	LOCATION	being entirely defeated by the Rebels taking possession of the City , overturning all legal Government , and compelling Adherence to the Designs of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, will also prevent
New York	LOCATION	being a Rendezvous for his
Majestys Fleet	ORGANIZATION	the ensuing Winter .

		I presume their Lordships are well informed that from the time the Ice begins to run until the River is again open in the Spring , and whether sooner or later depends wholely upon the Severity of the Winter , no Ship can lie in the River except a long side the wharf at
New York	LOCATION	.

		As things now are I can not think of putting his Majestys Ships in the power of Rebels , therefore the
Asia	LOCATION	must leave that place when the Winter begins , and come to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		But as the Navigation of this River and the
Delaware	LOCATION	are shut up only a few months , their Lordships may depend that Ships shall be ready to enter them the moment it is possible to anchor with Safety in the Stream ; and that in the mean time preparations shall be made , and measures concerted if possible , to prevent the Rebels receiving Succours from the Southern Colonies by the passes of
Hudsons River	LOCATION	in the Spring .

		Neither of the four Frigates mentioned in your Letter are yet arrived ; It is particularly unfortunate at this Juncture , for , expartation ceasing by order of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	after the 10th instant , the Merchants have hurried out their Vessels from every part , and by good information I learn that no provisions are now shipped but in return for Powder .

		From every Intelligence I get , and from the known disposition of this ungrateful people , I have not the least Doubt of their resisting until an effectual exertion of our power compels them to be just and obedient .

		With this persuasion and having besides many reasons to apprehend an attempt to destroy
Halifax Yard	LOCATION	, and indeed overrun the whole province of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, on the 10th instant I ordered Captain
Le Cras	PERSON	to remain at
Halifax	LOCATION	, and acquainted him that he should winter there for its greater Security , and to forward the Equipment of his Majesty 's Ships .

		I need not mention how necessary such an active Officer is for this Service ; In order to give weight to his Command I at the same time ordered him to wear a broad Pendant while he remained on that
Service	ORGANIZATION	, hut to strike it when he left the Coast of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	.

		I trust their Lordships will approve my placing on that Station an Officer of Captain
Le Cras	PERSON	' Experience , so well acquainted with the Country and Climate ; therefore I can not think of sending the
Somerset	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	this Fall .

		Though the
Boyne	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	are by much too large for this
Harbour	LOCATION	, one at least must stay here this Winter .

		The Frigates and Sloops coming out are by no means sufficient to answer all the purposes of Government , several must immediately go to
Savannah	LOCATION	,
South and North Carolina	LOCATION	; Bermudas and -LSB- New -RSB-
Providence	LOCATION	should this Winter be kept in Order ; a small Squadron must winter in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	: Upon the whole , if the four Frigates and three Sloops you have mentioned are all that are to come to
America	LOCATION	, I can not send home the large Ships .

		I shall moor them before the Town .

		One or two Frigates must lie in
Nantasket	LOCATION	; Sloops in other passes of this Harbour .


Rhode Island	LOCATION	and the Sound should be well guarded ; the present force there is not sufficient by four Sail .

		At
Boston	LOCATION	the Boat Duty is extremely hard ; it will continue so all the Winter .

		In the large Ships we have many resources : we should have been greatly distressed this Summer without the assistance of their men and Stores .

		I do assure you , Sir , we are every way more harrassed than if on an Enemy 's Coast ; but my patience is nearly exhausted , and I will not much longer suffer the Rebels with Impunity to insult and annoy us .

		I will now finish this Letter and reply to that part of yours respecting provisions in my next .

		Sir I am favoured by the receipt of yours of the 7th and 9th of August by Captain
Montagu	PERSON	of the
Kings Fisher	PERSON	.

		When I wrote to you on the 17th of July I really did not mean or wish that Captain
Macartney	PERSON	should be brought to a Court Martial my only desire was that he might be removed or Superceeded in his Command here tho ' I do acknowledge on my reexamining the first part of my Letter that such an inference might be drawn from it as I think will admit of the Construction you have put on it , and therefore am much obliged to you for the attention you have been so good as -LSB- to -RSB- pay to it , at the same time I am really sorry for the disagreeable Consequences it has drawn upon Captain
Macartney	PERSON	who is I realy believe as you describe him a most exceeding diligent , punctual good Officer and perfectly well qualified to
Command	ORGANIZATION	any of his Majesty 's Ships , but I am now of the Opinion I was then , that tho ' capable of Commanding a Single Ship , when he has only to obey Orders , that he is very unequal in these exceeding difficult times to
Command his Majesty 's Squadron	ORGANIZATION	here in a very extensive Colony like this and where there is a very Artful , Subtle set of people to deal with as perhaps any on the Continent , and I realy believe the inprudencies he has been guilty of proceeded more from a want of knowledge of
Mankind	LOCATION	than from any bad intention , this being the case I hope you will not only reinstate him in his Ship but also in your former good Opinion .

		Capt.
Squire	PERSON	who now Commands here I have been much obliged to for every mark of attention and I make no doubt he will do as much as can be expected in this very extensive Colony for the good of His Majesty 's Service with the very small force under his Command .

		I am much obliged to you for your good intention of reinforcing us here whenever it is in your power , I trust in God it may be soon for this unhappy Country is at present in a very deplorable State .

		If you and the General were of my Opinion you would all come and Winter here as Nature will block up all the Northern Ports for three or four Months at least .

RICHARD RILEY	PERSON	TO GEORGE GRAY Sir : ー Marcushook , Sept. 13th , 1775 .

		I expect the Province boats will shortly be finished & their Station appointed .

		If it is to be above the Shiver de frees 's , I apprehend they will be a partial defence , which ought not to be , as every person within the Limits of the Province is Intitled to a Provincial protection , the small as well as the great , which will not be the case with those below the station .

		With submission , every Frontier ought to be defended as long as possible , & not an Inch of ground given up that can be defended .

		If the
Frontier	ORGANIZATION	is defended , of Course the City is also ; but the City may be defended & the
Frontier	ORGANIZATION	suffer .

		I am of opinion that the whole Fleet ought to be stationed at the Boundary of the Province , and then , if they are any Protection , every Person above them will Receive a Benefit .

		As to a
Harbour	LOCATION	, there is a large
Island	LOCATION	opposite , where they may be very safe , & I believe that provisions may be had cheaper .

		If they are stationed at the
Fort	LOCATION	,
Chester & Marcushook	ORGANIZATION	may be Reduced to ashes before any Relief can be obtained , which would be a Considerable Loss , as all the Records & other publick papers of the County is their .

		I think it is matter worthy of Consideration , & should be obliged to you to mention it to the board .

		And as to the persons mentioned for officers here , I believe -LSB-
John -RSB- Moulder	PERSON	& -LSB-
David	PERSON	-RSB-
Ford	ORGANIZATION	would Answer the end , the first for Capt. , the other for Lieuf ` t ; but if the bord should think otherways , I shall be passive , as I have no friend to serve .

		I shall give you as true an Acc ` tt of them as I am able , which is that they are sober men ー men of Courage & activity , both bred to the water , & have both Commanded Shalloops .


Ford	ORGANIZATION	is a very good seaman , & he tells me he has been in two sea actions .


Moulder	PERSON	has not been to sea , I believe , but is very well acquainted with the management of a Vessel , a man of Conduct , & have both applyd for Births .

		I have nothing further to say Respecting them , and if persons may be had better Qualify 'd for that service I will Readily agree , as it is the Public good that ought to be only attended to , and , as I observ 'd before , I have not , nor desire to have , any friend to serve at the Publick ex pence .

GEORGE JAMES BRUERE	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	No 24
Bermuda	LOCATION	Sept the 13th 1775 My Lord I was disappointed , of any oportunity of Conveyance , for any letters either to Your Lordship , or to General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, until the 3d of September ; I had agreed with the Master of a Vessel to go to
Boston	LOCATION	, for fifty pounds , to carry my Despatchess and some live Stock to General
Gage	PERSON	.

		And just as the Sloop was getting under Sail , the Mate of the Vessel , I suppose having been tampered with , refused to go .

		However I put a Negro of my own and another Negro on board , and the Captain put to Sea in the evening , with only three negroes with him .

		And some little time after , the Vessel got out of the
Harbour	LOCATION	, three Members of
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, and two of them were Delegates , mustering up any Common People , that they could readily meet with , to the Number of 16 , or eighteen , went in a Boat , in pursuit of the vessel , in order to bring Her in again , or to take the Despatchess .

		Under pretence that the Sloop might have
Rice	PERSON	or flour on board , notwithstanding they knew very well , that there was not any on board .

		As soon as I had information , that they were gone on that Villanous Errant , being on the
Hill	ORGANIZATION	looking to the Sloop , I made a signal by a fire , from the
Hill	ORGANIZATION	, which was agreed on , with the trusty old negro , and a good Pilot that I had sent with the Captain , to make Sail on Seeing a fire .

		The Boat with the 16 or 18 People , did not return 'till after 12 o'Clock at night , or one in the morning , and gave out , that they had been on board , but found no Grain , and therefore let the Vessel go , but some of them said , that there was some blows , with the Captain of the Sloop , and one of the
Young	PERSON	f ellows , that went in the Boat ; however I don -LSB- ` t -RSB- believe , that they got on board the Sloop , for it blew pretty fresh in
Squals	LOCATION	, and they Say , the Boat had like to have been lost .

		The Revd Mr
Lyttleton	PERSON	was to have gone in the Vessel , but did not come to Town in time , until it was night , and the
Signal	ORGANIZATION	had been made , for the Vessel to make Sail , that the Boat might not get up to Her .

		I sent Your Lordship intelligence as follows to be forwarded by General
Gage	PERSON	, which I repeat , least any of my former letters , should be intercepted or that the Captain and my Negro in the Sloop , should have received any Damage , or the letters taken away by the People in the Boat .

		On Monday in the night of the 14 of August , when many members of
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	were come to Town , agreeable to Adjournment the Powder Magazine was broke into on Top just to let a man down , and the powder Room door , most Violently and Audaciously forced open from the inside , at the great hazard and risque of the Magazine blowing up , and about one hundred Barrels of powder stole and carried off ; and it may be Supposed put on board of a Vessel , Called the Lady
Catherine	PERSON	, belonging to
Virginia	LOCATION	, bound to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, or a Schooner Called the
Charles Town	PERSON	and
Savanna Packet	ORGANIZATION	, 2 belonging to
South Carolina	LOCATION	, both these Vessels Sailed , from the west , end of these
Islands	LOCATION	, twenty miles or more from the Magazine , on Monday morning , but were seen on Tuesday morning , and pursued by the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	boat , which I ordered to be sent out , but she could not over take either of the Vessels , And it hath been
Said	PERSON	, since that wicked affair was perpetrated , that the Country Whale boats towed the Vessels off .

		A large Reward was offered by Proclamation , as mentioned in my former letters , to any Person or Persons , that should make discovery & c , and bring any off ender or off enders to Conviction .

		I hope the Admiral , 3 will be able to Spare a frigat to come here and the General some of the Sick to
Recruit	ORGANIZATION	, from the benefit of the Climate and other Conveniencys .

		Otherwise I dont know what they may do , to the destruction of Myself the Chief Justice the Captain , and the few friends to Government .

		I sent the Negro fisherman , as good a Pilot , as any belonging to
Bermuda	LOCATION	, for the Purpose of bringin in a vessel in case they should send me .

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO COLONEL
BENEDICT	PERSON	ARNOLD By his Excellency
George Washington Esquire	PERSON	, Commander in Chief of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
United Colonies of North America	ORGANIZATION	.

		To Colonel
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	.

		1 .

		You are immediately on their March from
Cambridge	LOCATION	, to take the Command of the Detachment from the
Continental Army	ORGANIZATION	against Quebeck & use all possible Expedition , as the Winter Season is now advancing , and the Success of this Enterprize -LRB- under God -RRB- depends wholly upon the Spirit with which it is pushed , and the favorable Disposition of the Canadians and Indians .

		ー 2 .

		When You come to
Newbury Port	LOCATION	you are to make all possible Enquiry what Men of War or Cruizers there may be on the Coast to which this Detachment may be exposed on their Voyage to
Kennebeck River	LOCATION	ー and if You shall find that there is Danger of being intercepted You are not to proceed by Water , but by Land , taking Care on the one Hand not to be diverted by Light , & vague Reports , and on the other not to expose the Troops rashly to a danger which by many Judicious Persons has been deemed very considerable 3 .

		You are by every Means in your Power , to endeavor to discover the Real Sentiments of the Canadians towards our Cause , & particularly as to this Expedition , Ever bearing in Mind , that if they are averse to it , & will not cooperate or at least willingly acquiesce it must fail of Success ー In this Case You are by no Means to prosecute the Attempt , the Expence of the Expedition & the Disappointment .

		are not to be put in Competition with the Dangerous Consequences which may ensue from irritating them against us , and detaching them from that Neutrality which they have adopted .

		4 .

		In Order to cherish those favorable Sentiments to the
American Cause	ORGANIZATION	, that they have manifested , You are as soon as You arrive in their Country to disperse a Number of the Addresses You will have with You , particularly in those Parts where your Rout shall lay , & observe the strictest Discipline and good Order , by no Means suffering any Inhabitants to be abused or in any Manner injured , either in his Person or Property ー punishing with Exemplary Severity every Person who shall transgress & making ample Compensation to the
Party	ORGANIZATION	injured .

		ー 5 .

		You are to endeavour on the Other Hand to conciliate the Affections of those People and such Indians as You may meet with , by every Means in your Power , Convincing them that we come at the Request of many of their principal People , not as Robbers or to make War upon them , but as Friends and supporters of their Liberties as well as ours : And to give Efficacy to these Sentiments You must carefully inculcate upon the Officers and Soldiers under your Command that not only the Good of their Country & their Honour but their Safety depends upon the Treatment of these People .

		6 .

		Check every Idea , & crush in its earliest Stage every Attempt to plunder , even those who are known to be Enemies to our Cause , it will create dreadful Apprehensions in our Friends , and when it is once begun none can tell where it will stop , I therefore again most expressly order that it be discouraged & punished in every Instance , without Distinction .

		7 .

		Whatever King 's Stores You shall be so fortunate as to possess Yourself of , are to be secured for the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Use , agreeable to the Rules and Regulations of War published by the Honorable Congress , The Officers & Men may be assured that any extraordinary Services performed by them will be suitably rewarded .

		ー 8 .

		Spare neither Pains or Expence to gain all possible Intelligence on your March , to prevent
Surprizes & Accidents	ORGANIZATION	of every Kind ー & endeavour if possible to correspond with General
-LSB- Philip -RSB- Schuyler	PERSON	so that You may act in Concert with him .

		This I think may be done by Means of the St. Francis Indians .

		ー 9 .

		In Case of a Union with General
Schuyler	PERSON	, or if he should be in
Canada	LOCATION	upon your Arrival there , You are by no Means to consider Yourself as upon a seperate & independant Command , but are to put Yourself under him and follow his Directions ー Upon this Occasion and all others I recommend most earnestly to avoid All Contention about Rank In such a Cause every Part is honorable , in which a Man can serve his Country .

		ー 10 .

		If Lord
Chatham	LOCATION	's Son should be in
Canada	LOCATION	, & in any Way fall in your Power , You are enjoined to treat him with all possible Deference and Respect .

		You can not err in paying too much Honour to the Son of so Illustrious a Character & so true a Friend to
America	LOCATION	.

		2 Any Other Prisoners who may fall into Your Hands , You will treat with as much Humanity & Kindness as may be consistent with your own safety and the
Public Interest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Be very particular in restraining not only Your own Troops but the Indians from all Acts of Cruelty and Insult which will disgrace the American Arms ー and irritate our Fellow Subjects against Us .

		ー 11 .

		You will be particularly careful to pay the full Value for all Provisions or other Accomodations , which the Canadians may provide for You on your March ー By no Means press them or any of their Cattle into your Service , but amply compensate those who voluntarily assist You .

		For this Purpose You are provided with a Sum of Money in Specie , which You will use with as much Frugality and
Oeconomy	PERSON	as Your Necessities and good Policy will admit keeping an Exact Account as possible of your Disbursements .

		ー 12 .

		You are by every Opportunity to inform me of Your Progress , your Prospects & Intelligence & upon any Important Occurrence to dispatch an Express .

		ー 13 .

		As the Season is now far advanced , You are to make all possible Dispatch , but if unforseen Difficulties should arise or if the Weather should become so severe as to render it Hazardous to proceed in Your own Judgment & that of your Principal Officers -LRB- whom You are to consult -RRB- ー In that Case You are to return ; giving me as early Notice , as possible , that I may give You such Assistance as may be necessary ー 14 .

		As the Contempt of the Religion of a Country by ridiculing any of its Ceremonies or affronting its Ministers or Votaries has ever been deeply resented ; You are to be particularly careful to restrain every Officer & Soldier from such
Imprudence & Folly &	ORGANIZATION	to punish every Instance of It .

		ー On the Other Hand as far as it lays in your Power You are to protect and support the Free Exercise of the Religion of the Country and the Undisturbed Enjoyment of the Rights of Conscious in religious Matters with Your utmost
Influence & Authority	ORGANIZATION	ー Given under my Hand at Head Quarters
Cambridge	LOCATION	this 14th Day of September , One Thousand seven hundred & seventy five .

		ー This Sir is the Time to exert ourselves in sending to

		ー I have written to our Delegates strongly recommending it to them to use their Influence that Measures may be taken to procure sufficient Quantities of that necessary Article .

		ー I have also advised them to move in

		-LSB- Insert the
Committee of Safety of New York	ORGANIZATION	's certificate of September 7 in behalf of Captain
Isaac L. Winn	PERSON	-RSB- As by the manner of expression in the above certificate , it may possibly be thought by strangers to the transaction , that the article inserted by the Printer in his paper , was the ground of the suspicion raised against Capt.
Winn	PERSON	, and occasioned the pursuit , detention and examination of him and his vessel ; the Printer therefore , who thinks his Reputation of as much importance both publick and private , as Capt.
Winn	PERSON	's , finds it necessary to inform the public , that the information against Capt.
Winn	PERSON	, was given by one or two sailors who had belonged to the vessel , and the circumstance of his risking a vessel , loaded with a
West India	LOCATION	cargo , to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Newport	LOCATION	, when she was bound to
London	LOCATION	, and especially when it was notorious , that the men of war in
America	LOCATION	, usually detained all the vessels they met with loaded with
West India	LOCATION	goods , gave credibility to the information , and strengthened the suspicion against Capt.
Winn	PERSON	.

		Measures were taken to bring him and his vessel back , and they were actually in custody long before the Printer had published the article above refered to , which was a simple short account of the affair , as it was publickly reported at the time ; and surely he could not be blameable for mentioning in his paper , a report which the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	thought sufficiently credible to authorize their proceeding upon it ; and as after examination it appeared to them , that Capt.
Winn	PERSON	's character had received no blemish by the facts that had caused him to be suspected , neither could it be injured by mentioning those facts in a public paper .

PATRICK TONYN	PERSON	TO GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- A Fellow , Lempriere , is to be rewarded in
-LSB- South -RSB- Carolina	LOCATION	, with a large Ship , mounting several Guns , for an act of Piracy committed off this Bar , he is to be stationed to cruise off
Saint Marys River	LOCATION	, to intercept whatever Vessels are coming to this Province .

		2 No opportunity having offered before to convey to your Excellency an account of this audacious attempt , I beg now to trouble you with it .

		The 3d August in the afternoon , a Brig with
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	, came off this Bar .

		The 4 .

		the Provincial Vessel was sent to lighten the Brig , to bring as much powder out of her as she could stow .

		The Vessel returned the 5 .

		with two hundred ninety three barrels of Gunpowder , the Brig being sufficiently lightened .

		The 6 .

		being calm the Brig could not come into Port .

		The 7 .

		in the morning at low water , a Sloop which was taken for a Negro Vessel , run on board the Brig , boarded with twenty six Men armed , took away a hundred and eleven barrels of the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	powder , and some for the Merchants here .

		More powder would have been taken , but ten Soldiers were on board , as labourers without arms , to get the Ordnance stores out of the Brig : they grew angry , and began to plot , to seize some of the
Pirates	ORGANIZATION	arms to drive them out of the Brig. The
Pirates	ORGANIZATION	took the alarm , evacuated the Brig in confusion , leaving a part of their orders , signed
Henry Laurens	PERSON	, and a draught on a Merchant , Mr.
Broughton	PERSON	, in
Charlestown	LOCATION	for a thousand pounds Sterling , signed by the Commander
Clement Lempriere	PERSON	, as they pretended in payment for the powder .

		The instant I heard of this villainy , the provincial Vessel was equiped , with eight pieces of small ordnance , an officer and 30 Privats of the 14 .

		Regiment , and sailed in pursuit of the Pirates : they arrived off
Savannah Bar	LOCATION	, a few hours after the Pirate Sloop got over it , and went the inland passage to
Beaufort	LOCATION	in
-LSB- South -RSB- Carolina	LOCATION	, from which Place she had sailed .

		In consequence of the Protest made by the Master of the Brig , the inclosed proclamation was issued ; 3 I have tryed to get it inserted in the

PATRICK TONYN	PERSON	TO VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES Sir , In a letter to General
Gage	PERSON	of the 19 .

		July last , I mentioned the Savage Sloop , and Saint
John Schooner	PERSON	, stationed on this Coast , and the Island of
Providence	LOCATION	; that the
St John	ORGANIZATION	has been here only once , the others not att all .

		They Harbour at -LSB- New -RSB-
Providence	LOCATION	, out of the way of action , in perfect quiet ; when His Majesty 's service , calls for their assistance in these Seas .

		When the
St John	PERSON	was here , it was a critical hour , in the Province of
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		Lt -LSB-
William -RSB- Grant	PERSON	the Commander shew 'd me a note , he had received from Sir
James Wright	PERSON	, requesting to see him before he sailed , or that he would return again to
Savanah	PERSON	.

		I had dispatches of consequence for Sr
James Wright	PERSON	, which I desired him to take , advising him to return there , as the dissention , and disaffection were mounting to an extreme hight , between the Inhabitantnts in the interest of the Constitution , and the Rebelious .

		But , I requested of Mr
Grant	PERSON	, to return to this Port , which he promised .

		My Object for it was , I had intelligence , that armed Cruisers , were out from -LSB-
South -RSB- Carolina	LOCATION	, to intercept , some Merchant Ships , coming to this Place , with Ordnance stores for His Majesty
Garrison	PERSON	, and Powder for the Merchants .

		I intended on their appearance , the
St John	PERSON	should go out out to protect them , untill the wind permitted .

		them to come into the Harbour .

		If Mr
Grant	PERSON	had returned , an act of Piracy which happened off this Bar , would not have been committed .

		A relation of which I have wrote to his Excellency General
Gage	PERSON	, 2 and beg leave to enclose to you an extract of it .

		I also wrote to General
Gage	PERSON	, some intelligence I had procured , of Gunpowder being run , from the
West India Islands	LOCATION	, to the Province of -LSB- South -RSB-
Carolina	LOCATION	.

		A cruiser of considerable force , I am informed , is to be station.ed , from
Saint Mary River	LOCATION	, the north boundery of this Province , to intercept whatever vessels , may be bound to this Province , and is to be commanded by
-LSB- Clement -RSB- Lempriere	PERSON	, she is now equiping in
Carolina	LOCATION	.

		The letters from
England	LOCATION	, for this Province by the last mail , I have had no account of , but I hear it has been wrote to some Gentlemen here , that they are put into the Man of War in
Charlestown Harbour	LOCATION	.

		I have no means to send for them , was I to send the Provincial Vessel , she can make no resistance , and would be taken by any of the Rebel cruisers .

		From -LSB- South -RSB-
Carolina	LOCATION	a rebel
Packetboat	LOCATION	is established , that sails under a flag with liberty wrote upon it , to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and another to
Savanah	PERSON	.

		Our Coasts being intirely without defence , I thought you would be glad to have such information in maritim -LSB- e -RSB- affairs , as was in my powet ; to give ; at the same time I mean to draw your attention , to such services in these parts of His Majesty 's Dominions , as may be thought requisit , when I shall rejoice most heartily , to have our Coasts cleared of such petty insignificant cruisers , which are able to do great mischief to defenceless Merchant Ships .

Hampton	PERSON	from any insult that might be offered to them by capt.
Squire	PERSON	, who immediately communicated the same to the volunteers , when 100 men offered themselves , and next morning set out on their march to
Hampton	LOCATION	; where it is to be hoped , should the said
Squire	PERSON	attempt any thing hostile against the people there , that they will be able to give a good account of him .

		And as to his rer1uisition of the king 's stores , & c. that were on board the tender , being delivered up to him , it will be time enough to settle accounts with him after he has made satisfaction to the owners of the several slaves he has harboured -LRB- some of whom he now employs in the king 's service -RRB- as well as for the number of robberies he has suffered to be committed , in hogs and poultry , from sundry plantations .

Hampton	PERSON	we learn , that capt.

Hampton	LOCATION	road , where he now lies , and has seized three passage-boats , with the negroes in them , by way of reprisal , he says , for the stores & c. taken out of his tender , when drove ashore in the late storm ; which boats and negroes , it is likely , he intends taking into the king 's service , to send out a-pirating for hogs , fowls , & c. ー A very pretty occupation for the captain of one of his majesty 's ships of war !

		DIARY OF CAPTAIN
BARNARD ELLIOTT	PERSON	-LSB-
Charleston	LOCATION	, September 15 -RSB- ... about an hour after we set sail -LSB- from
Gadsden	LOCATION	's wharf -RSB- we crossed the harbour & came to an Anchor near the opposite shore not far from Captain Stones landing , it was with much difficulty that we disembarked , as we had but two small boats we could not land above fifteen men at a time , the Vessel being near half a Mile from the Shore & a long muddy flat , over which we partly draggd the boats , & then waded through the Water up to our
Middless	LOCATION	, this misfortune we attributed to the fear of the Captain who dreaded the consequence of being ha used down by the tide under the Cannon of Fort Johnson , which he apprehended was in the enemies hands , when One half a Mile more eastward would have given us a safe & good landing , without being commanded by the much dreaded Cannon of the
Fort	LOCATION	or the Tamar Man of War .

		Being arrived as I said before within half a Mile of the Shore Capt : Pinckneys Granadiers were orderd first to land & possess themselves of the sea beach , to cover us in case any foes should offer to Oppose our landing , as soon as his company was landed Captain
Elliotts Granadiers	PERSON	, embarked from on board the Vessel in the small boats , Col : -LSB-
Isaac -RSB- Motte	PERSON	landed in One & Captain
Elliott	PERSON	in the other , by this time the day began to dawn , Col.
Motte	PERSON	called
Captains Pinckney & Elliott &	ORGANIZATION	consulted with them whether it would be best to make an attempt upon the Fort before day with the troops that were landed , or to waite till the rest of the
Granadiers & Marians Light Infantry	ORGANIZATION	should land , they advised that an assault should be immediately made , & that Capt :
Marion	PERSON	should be order 'd to march up with his Company , & Lieut :
Shubrick	PERSON	with the Granadiers not yet landed , as soon as possible to their assistance , this being agreed on the following regulation was orderd .

		vizt ー Lieutent Mouat with a Detachment of the Granadiers of the first Regiment , & the Cadets was order 'd to scale the Wall of the South face of the
South West Bastion	LOCATION	, which having a Ladder already fixed to it might be perform 'd without much difficulty , this detachmt accordingly march 'd off to perform their orders .

		Col :
Motte	PERSON	with the remaining Granadiers , commanded by
Capt Pinckney	PERSON	followed the first detachmt & Capt.
Elliott	PERSON	brought up the rear , when the troops came within half a Mile of the fort they took their separate routs , in Order to invest the fort on three sides at Once , the other side being washed by the Sea could not be attempted but by Boats , which was thought unnecessary .

		When Lieut :
Mouatt	PERSON	came up to the Glaces he found the Gates open , and rushed in with his detachmt & took possession of the
Garrison	PERSON	making prisoners of all he found within .

		Col :
Motte	PERSON	with the Granadiers under Capt :
Pinckney	PERSON	soon after enter 'd the Gate taking possession of the
Fort	LOCATION	while Capt :
Elliott	PERSON	with a detachment of his Granadiers scaled the Walls of the
Barbet Battery	PERSON	, & took possession of it , he found all the Cannon , consisting of Seven twenty Six pounders , Twelve Eighteen pounders , One Twelve pounder and One Nine pounder , dismounted & thrown off the Platform , so that they were renderd useless for immediate service , but upon examining the touch holes found they were not spiked , this he informed Col :
Motte	PERSON	of immediately , who at this time had the commander of the Fort before him to deliver up the Keys of the Magazine & Gates of the Fort , the Col : desired to be informed by him who had done this Mischief , he reply 'd that the Men of Wars Men under the direction of the Governors Secretary , Capt.
-LSB- Alexander -RSB- Innes	PERSON	had left the fort two hours ago , that they had enterd his room , made him a prisoner and he supposed they had done it , he then gave up the keys , Col :

VIRGINIA	LOCATION	GAZETTE , SATURDAY , SEPTEMBER 16 , 1775
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, September 16 .

		In our last we mentioned the burning of a man of war 's tender near
Hampton	LOCATION	, and other circumstances relative to the affair , but find the account is erroneous , and that we were misinformed .

		The vessel was the property of Captain -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Collins	PERSON	, and the men belonging to the
Magdalen	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Squires	PERSON	and some of his people were on board at the time the vessel reached the shore , but all left her except the gunner , the pilot and a private man , who took to their boat next day , and carried every thing they wanted , except the guns , the vessel 's tackle , and furniture , which they gave to one Fin , near whose house she was .

		None of the men were molested , but treated with much civility .


Ruth	PERSON	, the pilot , an American , was only secured as a witness against several notorious sheep-stealers .

		COMMITTEE OF
ELIZABETH CITY COUNTY	LOCATION	, AND THE TOWN OF
HAMPTON	PERSON	TO CAPTAIN
MATTHEW SQUIRE	PERSON	To
Matthew Squire	PERSON	, esq ; commander of his majesty 's ship Otter , lying in
Hampton	LOCATION	road .

		Sir ,
Hampton	LOCATION	, September 16 , 1775 .

		Yours of the 10th instant , directed to the committee of the town of
Hampton	LOCATION	, reciting , `` that a sloop tender on his majesty 's service was on the 2d instant cast on shore near this place , having on board some of the king 's stores , which you say were seized by the inhabitants , and demanding an immediate return of the same , or .

		that the people of
Hampton	LOCATION	must answer the consequences of such outrage , '' was this day laid before them , who , knowing the above recital to be injurious and untrue , think proper here to mention the facts relative to this matter : The sloop , we apprehend , was not in his majesty 's service , as we are well assured that you were on a pillaging or pleasuring party ; and although it gives us pain to use indelicate expressions , yet the treatment received from you calls for a state of the facts in the simple language of truth , however harsh it may sound .

		To your own heart we appeal for the candour with which we have stated them ; to that heart which drove you into the woods in the most tempestuous weather , in one of the darkest nights , to avoid the much injured and innocent inhabitants of this county , who had never threatened or ill used you , and who would , at that time , have received you , we are assured , with humanity and civility , had you made yourself and situation known to them .

		Neither the vessel or stores were seized by the inhabitants of
Hampton	LOCATION	; the gunner , one mr.
Gray	PERSON	, and the pilot , one
mr. Ruth	PERSON	, who were employed by you on this party , are men , we hope , who will still assert the truth .

		From them divers of our members were informed , that the vessel and stores , together with a good seine -LRB- which you , without cause , so hastily deserted -RRB- were given up as irrecoverably lost , by the officers , and some of the proprietors , to one Finn , near whose house you were drove on shore , as a reward , for his entertaining you , & c. with respect and decency .

		The threats of a person whose conduct hath evinced that he was not only capable , but desirous , of doing us , in our then defenceless state , the greatest injustice , we confess , were somewhat alarming ; but , with the greatest pleasure , we can inform you , our apprehensions are now removed .

		Although we know we can not legally be called to account for that which you are pleased to style an outrage , and notwithstanding we have hitherto by you been treated with iniquity , we will , as far as in our power lies , do you right upon just and equitable terms .

		First .

		We , on behalf of this community , require from you the restitution of a certain
Joseph Harris	PERSON	, the property of a gentleman of our town , and all other our slaves whom you may have on board ; which said
Harris	PERSON	, as well as other slaves , hath been long harboured , and often employed , with your knowledge -LRB- as appeared to us by the confession of
Ruth	PERSON	and others , and as is well known to all your men -RRB- in pillaging us , under cover of night , of our sheep and other live-stock .

		Secondly .

		We require that you will send on shore all boats , with their hands , and every other thing you have detained on this occasion .

		And Lastly .

		That you shall not , by your own arbitrary authority , undertake to insult , molest , interrupt , or detain , the persons or property of any one passing to and from this town , as you have frequently done for some time past .

		Upon complying with those requisitions , we will endeavour to procure every article left on our shore , and shall be ready to deliver them to your pilot and gunner , of whose good behaviour we have had some proofs .

		We are , & c. The committee of
Elizabeth City	LOCATION	county and town of
Hampton	LOCATION	.

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO CAPTAIN
JAMES WALLACE	PERSON	,
H.M.S. ROSE Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	17 Septr 1775 , Sir With great Pleasure I have received and read your Account of the action with the Rebels at Stony town : I very much approve of your Conduct , and am happy to learn the good Effects resulting from it .

		The Rebels are fortifying their
Sea Port Towns	LOCATION	, and are endeavouring to equip a
Naval Force	ORGANIZATION	; they will really become formidable from their unwearied Application and from remaining unmolested : therefore I can no longer forbear to take such measures on this occasion , however disagreeable and dangerous , as his Majesty 's Honour , the safety of the
Squadron and Army	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	and my own Duty requires .

		To this end you will receive the inclosed Order ; and I desire that in obeying it , you will endeavour to distinguish as much as possible his Majesty 's loyal Subjects from his inveterate Enemies and Subverters of legal Authority and good Government .

		I observe you have manned two Sloops , and though I am satisfied how necessary small Vessels are for the Service you are employ 'd on , yet the Ships with me are in such want of men , that I am obliged to take your Supernumeries , I consent however to your reserving twenty above your Complement , which with what you raise in future will make the Rose tolerably well manned .

		I send
Lieutt	PERSON	.

		-LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Graves	PERSON	in the
Bolton Brig	ORGANIZATION	to reinforce your little
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, and will replace the Swan with another Sloop as soon as possible .

		A Letter from Governor
Bruere	PERSON	Yesterday confirmed the Account you have given of the Robbery at Bermudas .

		We knew of the Powder being taken from the Storeship bound to
St Augustine	LOCATION	, but Sir
James Wright	PERSON	hoped that the Carolinians intended it to fulfill their Indian Engagements , and that it would not have been sent to the
Rebel Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Vessel with Arms from
St Croix	ORGANIZATION	is bad News indeed .

		I hear the
Alderney	PERSON	and
Raven Sloops	ORGANIZATION	are on their passage to me from
England	LOCATION	; by these Vessels we may expect I think the ultimate Determination of
Great Britain	LOCATION	with respect to her rebellious Colonies .

		In the mean time we must endeavour to annoy and distress them to the utmost : You may expect to hear we have begun to the Eastward , but I would not have such Intention mentioned for obvious Reasons .

		I suppose you will not suffer them to carry off your Hay Sloop with impunity , but I desire you will be cautious of engaging with the shore where the Dangers are so disproportioned to the expected Advantages .

		We are and shall be in want of good Pilots for the Sound ,
Nantucket Shoals	ORGANIZATION	, and indeed for the whole Coast .

		Such as you can meet with I would have detained , and , if they will serve voluntarily , they shall immediately commence Pay .

		1775 Sir .

		Your Favours of the 9 , 15 , & 15 .

		Inst .

		have been duly received : The Readiness of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to cooperate with me in procuring the most authentick Intelligence & dispatching Captn -LSB-
Abraham -RSB- Whipple	PERSON	for this Purpose , is peculiarly satisfactory , & I flatter myself will be attended not only with Success , but with the happiest Consequence to the publick Cause ー I should immediately have sent you Notice of the Paragraph in the Philada Paper -LRB- which is all the Account I have of the taking the Powder at Bermudas -RRB- but I supposed it had come to your Hands , before it reached ours : I am inclined to think it sufficient to suspend Captn Whipples Voyage at least till further Intelligence is procured from
Philada	LOCATION	as it is scarecely supposable the Vessels would have left any Quantity behind worth the Risque & Expence of such a Voyage .

		ー As this Enterprize will therefore most probably be laid aside for the present it may be proper for Capt.
Whipple	PERSON	to keep his Station a few days longer for the Packet .

		It must be remembered they generally have long Passages , & we are very sure she has not yet arrived at
Boston	LOCATION	, nor do I find she is expected there .

		ー The Voyage to
Bayonne	LOCATION	is what I should much approve & recommend , The Person sent to
Govr Trumbull	PERSON	has not yet called upon me ; but the Scheme appears so feasible , that I should be glad to see it executed , at the same time I must add that I am in some doubt as to the Extent of my Powers to appropriate the publick Money here to this Purpose .

		I could wish you would communicate it to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, for which you will have
Time	ORGANIZATION	sufficient , & I make no doubt of their Concurrence .

		In fact the State of our
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	here at present is so low that it would be impracticable to be of any Service to the Expedition if all other Objections were obviated ... Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		Said Tender being observed to take on board a number of Marines from the ship , and pursue several boats as they passed , and frequently running backward and forward by the Point of said
Harbour	PERSON	, the People suspecting they were on no good Design , kept a Guard with about twelve Men , to watch their Motions ; said Tender discovering three Men leaning on a fence near my house , they stood for the shore , as near as they could , and instantly fired two Guns , about 2 pounders , with Grape Shot , which was followed immediately with several volleys of small Arms from the Marines , which put the women and children in great confusion .

		ー Said Guard running direct for the shore , the Tender instantly stood off , and before they could get to the shore by reason of a pond , she was out of shot .

CONTINENTAL CONGRESS Gentlemen ー Charles Town So Carolina	ORGANIZATION	18 Septem 1775 As we have business of very great importance to lay before you , which we think will merit the consideration of the Representatives of the
United Colonies	LOCATION	we are fortunate in meeting with the present opportunity for its conveyance by Mr
Hindson	PERSON	who has promised not only to deliver our dispatches into your own hands but also to communicate a verbal message which can not be so well imparted in any other manner .

		Recent transactions of a most dangerous tendency in the interior parts of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, the treachery of our Governor who has been pursuing the Steps of Mr.
-LSB- Josiah -RSB- Martin	PERSON	nearly as his situation would allow him , our late intelligence respecting the Indians & the unhappy differences which now subsist among the
Inhabitants of Charles Town	ORGANIZATION	render this application for your advice & assistance absolutely indispensible .

		We had for some time entertained suspicions of the conduct of
L. Wm. Campbell	PERSON	, but a late circumstance has furnished us with positive proof of his disengenuity & intention to undo us by stealth .

		His Lordship had not only shown a fair face when waited upon , but had in the most condescending terms invited Gentlemen to call on him in order to give him opportunity for expressing his good wishes to the Colony while he was at the same time privately spiriting up the people on our Frontiers to oppose our Association & to hold themselves in readiness to act in Arms against the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	ー after having received reiterated accounts of the increasing discontents of those people , together with assurances that they were instigated by the Emissaries of the
British Administration	ORGANIZATION	& supported by the promises of Royal favour , this
Council	ORGANIZATION	judged it expedient to send proper persons to _ explain to them , the causes & nature of the dispute subsisting between

		men of the
Regiment of Rangers & Militia	ORGANIZATION	under the direction of Mr.
Drayton	PERSON	at Ninety Six we hope he will be able to suppress all opposition or at least to drive away the ringleaders of it .

		ー among the head of our opponents was
Capt Moses Kirkland	PERSON	who may with great justice be denominated a Traitor .

		ー he had actually taken a Commission in the service of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, & had enlisted a Company of Rangers whom he afterwards incited to
Mutiny & Desert	ORGANIZATION	.

		this Man after having threatened the destruction of Augusta & Recapture of
Fort Charlotte	LOCATION	in vain attempted to make a stand with his adherents & being closely pursued fled in disguises to
Charles Town	PERSON	, which he entered by night took sanctuary in the Governor 's House & was by His Lordship 's means conveyed on board the Tamar Sloop of War .

		ー A report of this fact was soon brought to the Gen. Committee which happened to be sitting & a discovery was made of a person who had been one of
Kirkland 's Company of Rangers &	ORGANIZATION	had attended him in his flight , this person being Committed to the Guard was made use of by some of the Officers of our Troops to carry on a stratagem the result of which you will learn from one of the inclosed papers marked `` Minutes of a Conversation . ''

		The Committee upon this discovery demanded a sight of the Letters which the Governor had just received from Administration by the Swallow Packet .

		His Lordship preemptorily refused to comply but in the course of conversation acknowledged that Ships & Troops were to be sent from
England	LOCATION	to all the Colonies & might be shortly expected ; the next Evening he gave orders for dismantling Fort
Johnson	PERSON	which was in part performed by men from on board the
Tamar	PERSON	who dismounted all the Guns on the lower Battery & broke many of the Carriages , after which His Excellency dissolved the Assembly & without assigning any reasons in public , retired on board that Man of War where he has ever since remained & from certain circumstances we believe he means to remove his family to the same place .

		ー fortunately the Seamen neglected to spike the Cannon we have therefore taken possession of the Fort & remounted them ー the
Garrison	PERSON	now consists of about 400 .

		of our new raised Troops commanded there by
Callo -LSB- Isaac -RSB- Motte	PERSON	we intend to persevere in repairing the Fort & will put it in the best posture of defence .

		We also intend to fortify the
Harbour	LOCATION	as effectually as our circumstances will admit of ー tis possible the Man of War may interrupt our proceedings , in such Case we shall be under a necessity of attempting to take or destroy her .

		ー here we are at a loss to know to what lengths each
Colony	ORGANIZATION	will be warranted by the
Voice of America	ORGANIZATION	in opposing & resisting the King 's Officers in general & the British Marine , tho ' such opposition should be necessary for the very existence of a Colony & support of the Common Cause .

		ー Our Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in June last Resolved that Officers in the two Regiments of Foot in Colony Pay should when acting in Conjunction with Officers of the Militia of equal Commissions take Rank & precedence of these without regard to dates of Commissions ー this Regulation gave no Umbrage till lately , when we judged it necessary to Issue an Order for compelling many delinquents to do equal duty with their fellow Citizens in the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	then a general
Clamour	PERSON	was raised , petitions & Remonstrances from the `` 12 United Companies '' of Volunteers were sent in , to this board & to the
General Committee	ORGANIZATION	& the dispute was carried to so great a height as to threaten an overthrow of our Association , temperate measures have however pacified many of the well meaning honest people who have been misled by the contrivances of false friends , nevertheless there remains no inconsiderable degree of ferment & dissatisfaction ー to this untoward circumstance add , the unfavourable accounts which we have received from the Indians , the danger which we are always exposed to & more especially at this time from domestic Insurrection the expectation of British Troops & Ships of War with other incidents hereafter to be mentioned & you will agree that we have before us a very unpleasant prospect .

		We have been informed that you have granted 1000 Men to
North Carolina	LOCATION	on Accot .

		of the disturbance in that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, be that as it may surely we in this weaker part stand more in need of an
Army of Observation & General Officers to Command	ORGANIZATION	all our forces , at the general charge of the Colonies : we would if time had permitted have applied to
North Carolina & Georgia	ORGANIZATION	to have joined us in an application for such an
Army	ORGANIZATION	, & we now recommend it to your serious consideration & enjoin you to Address the
General Congress	ORGANIZATION	upon this subject & to use your endeavors for obtaining such defence for us , without which
Carolina & Georgia	ORGANIZATION	will be involved in such difficulties as may & probably will greatly injure the common Interests of
America	LOCATION	.

		We particularly request you to consider of proper measures for Regulating the Militia & to procure a strong recommendation on this head from the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		the Judges have refused to do business in their departments , hence the Courts are shut up , the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	may soon follow the example & we rather suspect it from an application which Mr
Haliday	PERSON	has made for leave to retire from the province altho ' he has assured us that he will leave a Deputy .

		We have used our utmost endeavours & gone to very great expence for procuring amri : mnition , we were stimulated to the Act upon
Lofthouse	PERSON	's Vessel at
Augustine Bar	LOCATION	by our hearty desire to supply the common Stock on your side , we rejoice to learn that you now have abundance We have also in our Magazine enough to serve our present purposes & no bad prospect of receiving additional quantaties very speedily ー but none to spare ー Nothing would be more acceptable to us than two or three thousand stand of good Arms is it possible to obtain such & so many from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	?

		if it is , we recommend it as a most essential service ー Your letter of the 3d August with Resolutions of the 1st came duly to hand , perhaps after a
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	is established , the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will find it necessary to open the American ports to Foreigners & to pursue the most vigorous measures in our Infant state , by Sea as well as Land neither of which in our opinion can be effected if the Doctrine of abandoning our Sea Coasts should prevail ー & We must not conclude without intreating you to consider of proper measures for the keeping the Militia in due subordination & procuring a strong recommendation , on this head from the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー By order of the Council of Safety .

		BRIGADIER GENERAL
RICHARD MONTGOMERY	PERSON	TO MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	Dear Sir , Sepr 19th 1775 Camp near
St Johns	LOCATION	I take the Opporturiity of
Fulmore	ORGANIZATION	's A Return with the
Oneidas	ORGANIZATION	to acquaint you of our Arrival here on the 17th in the Evening .

		Yesterday Morning I marched with 500 Men to the
North Side of St Johns	LOCATION	where we found a Party of the King 's Troops with Field Pieces .

		This Party had beaten off Major -LSB- John -RSB- Brown B a Few Hours before who had imprudently thrown himself in their Way depending on our more early Arrival , which thro the Dilatariness of our young Troops could not be sooner affected .

		The Enemy after an ill directed Fire for some Minutes retired with Precipitation , & lucky for them they did ; for had we known their Situation which the Thickness of the Woods prevented our finding out till it was too late , there would not a Man of them have returned .

		The old Story of Treachery spread among the Men , as soon as we saw the Enemy , we were trepanned drawn under the Guns of the Fort and what not .

		The Woodsmen c were not so expert at forming as I expected , and too many of them hung back .

		Had we kept Silence at first before we were discovered , we should have gotten a Field Piece or two .

		I have left the 500 Men at the joining D of the two Roads .

		This Day I have sent them entrenching Tools .

		Things seem to go well among the Canadians .

		It is strongly reported that the
Kings Stores	ORGANIZATION	are embarked at
Montreal	LOCATION	in order to be removed .

		I have sent Col.

		Send me Money as fast as possible my Dear General .


Guy Johnson	PERSON	& -LSB-

Fulmore	ORGANIZATION	will give you an Account of our Council .

		I have great Dependance on your Presence at
Tyonderoga	LOCATION	to administer to our many Wants .

		I most earnestly hope this may find you relieved from the Acuteness of your Pain !

		A perfect Cure in so short a Time can hardly be expected .

		Believe me my dear Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		P.S. On the 17th at Night Major
Brown	PERSON	intercepted eight Carts going to the
Fort	LOCATION	, laden with Rum & Gun Carriages for the Vessels .

		Those Things were hid in the Woods , and were not recovered by the Enemy on
Brown	PERSON	's discomfiture .

Occaison	PERSON	now to write you , on some Real Business I shall make some Observations in said Letter by heartily thanking you for the Advancem -LSB- en -RSB- t you were pleas 'd to make on Capt -LSB-
William -RSB- Willcombs Cargoe	PERSON	, as well as for your Attachment to my Interest in storing said
Cargoe	PERSON	for a Price & I must now entreat , that you keep it in Store untill it will obtain 2 / which must very soon be the Case , if the present Contest continues .

		ー Capt Willcombs Disburstments I think are very extravagant ; his Sail Makers
Bill	PERSON	, exceeds the first
Bill	PERSON	she had of that Sort , & I can not account for it as no New Sails were made for her , but doubt not , you 've obtain 'd it as cheap as possible : I think your Charge of Commission is reasonable , even if you had not made the Advance , & if those Advances are now detrimental to you , would have you sell as much Molasses as will reimburse you , & keep the Remainder untill further Orders .

		No doubt you have heard in this , of the Scho -LSB- one -RSB- r

Baltimore	LOCATION	ship 'd me , 13 Blls for my own Use which safely arriv 'd here in a
Vessell	ORGANIZATION	loaded with Cornby which Means , my Family , will be ample provided for ー I hope soon to hear from you of Capt Willcombs Arrival in
Falmouth	LOCATION	& should he return to your Place , would have him , take on
Board	ORGANIZATION	, all the Molasses I may have left , after deducting enought to pay your
Ballance	PERSON	, & lay with the same on
Board	ORGANIZATION	untill the Season grows bad , & then proceed hither , provided you can get the
Vessell & Cargoe	ORGANIZATION	insured at a reasonable Rate , as I imagine the Risque will be , but small , when the Season Advances , as the Cruisers can not keep out much longer on this Coast , indeed the Risque now is not very great , if Care is taken by the Comm -LSB- amder -RSB- s to keep a good look out , & run by Night , or in dark Weather as Vessels arrive daily , who conduct in that Manner , & keep far to the Eastward , indeed but 2 Vessells have been intercepted that were destin 'd for this Port , & one of them , was Mr Whites ー I have within these few Days received Advice from Capt -LSB-
Eleazer -RSB- Johnson	PERSON	of his Arrival in the
West Indies	LOCATION	, & to an agreable Markett , & as his Orders will admitt of his coming home late in the fall , he writes me the Prospect of making a Voyage is very great , & he is at some Loss wither to take on a Cargoe for this Place or proceed with a freight to
France	LOCATION	; but as I have wrote him , such Encouraging Circumstances , how to conduct himself on the Coast , & the Profitts he will make if he gets in Safe , I am well convinced he will proceed for this Place , with his Hold , only full of Molasses , & perhaps light Produce between Decks , which will put his Vessell in such a Trim as to enable him , to keep clear of most of their Vessells , she is very remarkable for Sailing , especially by the Wind , for when she was building , we had strong Suspicions of a french War , & we built her for a Privateer & she answers the Expectation as to her Sailing , for even Log Loaded the Lively Man of War ; clias 'd her 20 Leagues & never gain 'd upon her a Mile , untill the Wind veered & bro ' t the Lively to Windward of her , when she with great Difficulty came up with her ; I have thus given you her true Character , that if you can obtain Insurance upon her , you may be enabled to effect it on more reasonable Terms , as its Certainly less Risque on such a Vessell than common Merchantmen , she is well fitted , having two Sutes of Sales on Board , one of them entirely New , as many Light Sales , as a Brig can sett to Advantage , & rigging sufficient to keep them & the Spars in their proper Places , extreamly well manned , & a Capable Comm -LSB- ande -RSB- r who is well acquainted with the Coast from
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	to
Cape Ann	LOCATION	, & I have order 'd him to keep far to the Eastward , & if he is chas 'd to put to Sea , if he can not make a
Harbour	LOCATION	, so that he might not be caught within 3 Leagues of the Land , & you may depend every Care will be taken to avoid a Capture , under these Circumstances , if the Gentlemen of your City , have an Inclination , to take Part of the Risque at a reasonable Premium , please to obtain the following Sums ー # 1200 Currency on the Brig

		he writes me he shall not sail untill the last of this Month or begginning of October , by the

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO JOHN HANCOCK Sir
Tyconderoga Septr	PERSON	19th 1775 Since my last of the 8th Inst which I had the Honour to write from
Isle	LOCATION	aux Noix , my disorder -LRB- proceeding from a Bilious Fever & violent rheumatic Pains -RRB- encreased so much and reduced me so very low that it was thought necessary that I should return to this place to try , if possible to recover , which I hope with the assistance I have here will be soon accomplished .

		In my last I gave you an Account of our Operations to the date thereof .

		shall now continue it 'till the Day on which I came away ー On the 9th I received a Letter from
Canada	LOCATION	without
Signature	ORGANIZATION	, but which I know to be written by Mr
James Livingston	PERSON	Copy inclosed No 1 ; As I had thro ' other Channels a Corroboration of the
Inteligence	ORGANIZATION	contained in the former part of this Letter .

		I resolved , as I had not yet my Artillery , to dispatch 500 Men into
Canada	LOCATION	, and gave orders on the 9th .

		for their embarkation on the 10th with an additional number of about 300 to cover their landing and bring back the Boats , Copy of my Instructions to the commanding Officer inclosed No 2 .

		For the Event of this intended Expedition , see No 3 , which was drawn and delivered me by one of the
Party	ORGANIZATION	, and from what I can learn is just .

		This Body returned on Monday the Eleventh .

		On Tuesday the twelfth I found I had upwards of 600 sick ;
Waterbery	PERSON	's Regiment being reduced to less than 500 .

		General
Montgomery	PERSON	-LRB- for I was too ill to leave my Bed -RRB- perceived however with pleasure , that the Men were unable to bear the Reproach of their late unbecoming Behaviour , and taking the advantage of this happy Return to a sense of their Duty , on the 13th I issued the Orders contained in the Paper number four .

		The 14th proved rainy and retarded the Embarkation of the Cannon .

		On this Day Col.
Allen	PERSON	arived and made the Report No 5 , and I found myself so much better that I had hopes of moving with the
Army	ORGANIZATION	; but by 10 at night , my Disorder reattacked me with double violence , and every fair prospect of a speedy Recovery vanished .

		Great part of the 15th rainy , the embarkation much retarded by it .

		On the same day I received a Letter , of which No 6 is a Copy .

		On the 16th I was put into a covered Boat and left
Isle aux Noix	ORGANIZATION	, and as it rained part of the Day , I do not suppose that General
Montgomery	PERSON	could move until the 17th which proved fair .

		The mode of the intended Attack on
St Johns &	ORGANIZATION	c : as judged best , both by General
Montgomery	PERSON	& myself , is as follows : To land as near the
Fort	LOCATION	as we did the first time we went down ; the two row
Callies	PERSON	carrying a twelve Pounder each & well manned ; the Sloop and Schooner , and ten
Batteaus	PERSON	with picked men to lay in the
River	LOCATION	, ready to attack the Enemy 's Schooner -LRB- which is compleated & carries 16 Guns -RRB- in case she should attempt to destroy our Boats , or get to the southward of them , & thereby effectually cut off all communication between this place and the
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		After this naval Arrangement -LRB- which will take 350 Men -RRB- 500 men to be sent as a
Corps of Observation	ORGANIZATION	to intercept any Succours between
St. Johns	LOCATION	and
Chamblee	PERSON	, & to keep as near the former as possible ; two hundred Men in a Breastwork at the proposed Landing to cover the Boats and secure a Retreat for the Men in the Vessels and Boats , should the Enemy 's Vessel be too many for them ; the remainder of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	to invest the Place , and make the Approaches , and erect the Batteries .

		You will perceive Sir , by No 3 , that some of the
Enemys Boats	ORGANIZATION	fired on our People ; Capt -LSB-
William -RSB- Douglas	PERSON	, who commended one of the armed Boats , pointed and fired a twelve pounder , loaded with Ball and Grape Shot at them , and we have Accounts that about thirty of the unfriendly Canadians were killed or drowned .

		In the first engagemt on the 7th we killed them 6 Indians , two Caehnewagas , as many Mohawks -LRB-
Danil	PERSON	and
William	PERSON	a bastard Son of Sir
William Johnson	PERSON	-RRB- one Canassadaga & one
Huron	LOCATION	; and we are informed by a Caehnewaga and
Huron	PERSON	whom I left at
Isle aux Noix	LOCATION	, that not an Indian remains at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, & which I believe to be true ー The four Deputies sent by the six Nations to request the Canadian Indians to remain neuter were not returned when I left
Isle	LOCATION	aux Noix .

		I have taken the Liberty to desire General
Montgomery	PERSON	to make a present in the name of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to the Canadian Indians if he should think it necessary .

		Since the affair of the 10th the
Army	ORGANIZATION	at
Isle aux Noix	ORGANIZATION	which then consisted of 1394 Effectives , all Ranks included has been reinforced by
Capt Livingstons Company	ORGANIZATION	of New Yorkers nearly compleat , on the 16th by Col : -LSB-
Seth -RSB- Warner	PERSON	whom I met an hour after my departure with 170 green
Mountain Boys	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- being the first that had appeared of that boasted
Corps	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- he left this with about 50 more , but they mutinyed , and the remainder are at Crown Point ;
Capt Allen	PERSON	's Campy of the same
Corps	ORGANIZATION	arived here last night -LRB- every Man of which was raised in
Connecticut	LOCATION	-RRB- about 100 Men of Col : Bradles from
New Hampshire	LOCATION	-LRB- which
Corps	ORGANIZATION	was to have been up a fortnight before , the remainder , 150 of that Body were yet to come -RRB- joined , the 16 at night , and I suppose the
Artillery Company	ORGANIZATION	under Capt -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB- Lamb will join them to day ; these last were indispensably necessary , as we had none that knew any thing of the matter ; so that the whole reinforcement consists of about 400 .

		ー Yesterday I sent off 60 of -LSB-
James -RSB- Eastons	PERSON	, and 140 more are just embarking , this is the whole of that
Corps	ORGANIZATION	.

		About 125 of the first New Yark Battalion will embark early tomorrow together with the
Company of Green Mountain Boys	ORGANIZATION	consisting of about 70 .

		Two hundred and sixty of the 3d
New York Battalion	ORGANIZATION	remain here which I will forward on as soon as I can procure Craft , which is building slowly , as most of the Carpenters are gone home sick .

		I am so feeble that altho ' I have much to say about the sick , Musters , Accounts & other Matters , I feel myself under the necessity of confining me to such only , which I humbly conceive more immediately require the Attention of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		If we succeed what Troops are to remain in
Canada	LOCATION	?

		How are they to be engaged for that service ?

		The like for those at this Post , which at all events must have a
Garrison	LOCATION	, weaker or stronger , as matters may turn out in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The Weather already begins to be cold , the Troops in three Weeks more will with great difficulty , be able to stand it , thinly & poorly as they are clad ; how are they to be supplyed ?

		What kind of Conduct am I to pursue with the Canadians respecting Civil Matters -LRB- for I hope to join the Army as soon as I am in the least restored -RRB- .

		Where shall I get Gold & Silver to pay for necessaries for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	?

		Paper of any kind not having the least Currency in
Canada	LOCATION	?

		I wish a considerable Sum in Specie was immediately sent to Mr -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Trumbull	PERSON	the Pay-Master .

		Please to let me know what I am to do with the Artificers taken out of the Troops .

		See my Letter of the 26th July 9th Paragraph .

		I also wish an answer to the second Paragraph of that of the 6th , also to the 4th of the same , respecting an Hospital , in which I find there will be several Mates necessarily employed , as our Sick are so very numerous .

		I wish for some Resolution of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	agreeable to my Letter of 31st July , as Mr
Phelps	PERSON	still contines to act in conjunction with Mr
Livingston	PERSON	, which must necessarily be introductory of Confusion , of which I fear there is too much already ; one only should be employed as Chief in the Office , and the other may continue subordinate , for both are wanted .

		Should we meet with a Repulse , am I to prepare Timber for Vessels of superiour Strength to the Enemy 's against next Spring ?

		Perhaps other Matters of importance may have escaped my attention ; should I recollect any , I will do myself the Honour to communicate them to you .

NEW ENGLAND	LOCATION
SHIPMASTERS	ORGANIZATION	TO THE
RHODE ISLAND GENERAL ASSEMBLY Point Petre Guadaloupe	LOCATION	, 19th Septr .

		1775 Gentlemen The mutual Obligations we are under to promote the Welfare of the Community to which we belong we hope will apologize for & Justify us in giving you the following account .

		Vizt On the 12th Inst Capt
Stanton Hazard	LOCATION	arrived here from
Newport Rhode Island	LOCATION	which place , he says he left the 26th July last not long after his arrival we were inform 'd of his being loaded with
Spermaceti Candles	ORGANIZATION	, Flour & c. & that he was design 'd to Sell & load here & proceed to the
Coast of Africa	ORGANIZATION	.

		what quantity of flour he has on board we are not able to determine , but were assured by Mr.
Soubies	PERSON	, as principal A Merchant as any in this place , who was treating with him for the purchase of his cargoe , that he offer 'd him Sixty Bbls for Sale , adding that he must not Sell the whole of his Flour as he should want it for his own use , but upon Mr.
Soubies	PERSON	being inform 'd , that Capt. Hazards plan of Operation was in Opposition to the Spirit & welfare of his Country , & to the express prohibition of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, he declin 'd having any connection with him or his Cargoe ; the 15th Instant we sent Capt Hazard a Note requesting his attendance on shore the next Morning at nine oClock to give us some Satisfaction in this matter , with which he complied acknowledged the facts : As to the Flour , he said the exportation of it from
Newport	LOCATION	was approv 'd by the Community , that he bought it in the Open Markett with a profess 'd design of shipping it , that he publickly took it on board & no Objections were made , as to his plan of procedure , which we suppose prohibited by the second Article passed by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	the 20th Oct 1774 , Capt Hazard plead that said Article must have been design 'd to extend no farther than to fixing out Vessells for the Coast of
Africa	LOCATION	directly from , & importing Slaves directly back to our own ports , as by the subsequent part of said 2d Article , we are forbid dealing with those that are concern 'd in said Trade , but the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	do put Countenance upon our trading with the french , who are concern 'd in that Trade , that this construction was not of his own making to justify his present procedure , but was the light in which it was universally received throughout the extent of his acquaintance , & by the province of
Rhode Island & Town of Newport	ORGANIZATION	in particular that Mr -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Ward	PERSON	who was at that
Time	ORGANIZATION	a Member of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	declar 'd to him , that this was the Sense in which they meant said second Article should operate & no other , tho Mr
Ward	PERSON	had some scruples in his own Mind relative to the legality of said Trade under any Circumstances whatever , that in consequence of said construction several
Vessells	ORGANIZATION	had already fitted out for the
West Indies Islands	LOCATION	, there to sell their Cargoes , take in others & proceed upon the African Trade , & that the Community looked upon every Man at liberty to use his pleasure in this Matter , that he bought his Stores of one of the
Committee of Safety for the Town of Newport	ORGANIZATION	with whom he had several conferences relative to the
African Trade	ORGANIZATION	in which said Gentleman had heretofore been concern 'd , that his plan of Operation was publickly known , & universally approv ' d of in
Newport	LOCATION	, that the Odds between fixing out immediately from
Newport	LOCATION	or from the
West Indies	LOCATION	for the
African Trade	ORGANIZATION	was very considerable & as great a Sacrifice as any Man was called upon to make to the present Cause : However Gentlemen we apprehend Capt Hazard must have been mistaken relative to the design of said 2d Article & that he has misrepresented the Construction & Spirit of the People of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	in this matter , the 2d Article above referr 'd to runs thus , Vizt `` That we will neither import nor purchase any Slave imported after the first day of December next , after which Time we will wholly discountenance the Slave Trade , & will neither be concern 'd in it ourselves , nor will we hire our Vessells nor sell our Commoditys nor manufactories to those who are concernd in it ; -LSB- '' -RSB- We apprehend Gentlemen that the order not to hire our Vessels nor sell our Commoditys or Manufactories to those who are concern 'd in this Trade is just as extensive as the prohibition of importation , i.e. Extends to the members of the same Community in their dealings with each other , but can not with propriety be supposed to extend to the members of another
Community	ORGANIZATION	over whom they never had Jurisdiction , & by whose conduct in this matter they are not affected , to suppose they meant to prohibit the fixing out from or importing Slaves into their own Ports only , while their Members are left at full liberty to import them to every other part of the World , would not only be diametrically opposite the literal declaration & obvious meaning of said second Article , after which Time we will wholly discountenance the Slave Trade & c , but implies each Members discharge from all obligation to the
Community	ORGANIZATION	immediately after their getting out of their respective Ports ー On Saturday Capt Hazard promised to give us a Certificate under his hand importing the whole of what he had said relative to the Exportation of Flour , the Circumstances of his shipping it , being publick , the approbation of the People of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, his present plan of procedure , his Conference with Mr
Ward	PERSON	, the Names of several Gentlemen of .

		the
Committee of Newport	ORGANIZATION	with whom he had several Conferences on the above matter , & who were full in his Opinion as above related , it was also at that
Time	ORGANIZATION	agreed that Capt -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Parsons	PERSON	, should receive the above mentioned Certificate , which Capt Hazard promised to deliver him the next Monday morning Accordingly on Monday Morning ,
Capt Parsons	PERSON	wrote a Note & sent it by his Mate to Capt Hazard , of which the following is .

		a Cappy : ''
Capt Parsons	PERSON	presents his Compliments to Capt Hazard & in his own Name & the Name of the English Masters present , begs the favor of Capt Hazard 's sending by the bearer the Certificate he promised them last Saturday -LSB- '' -RSB- but as Capt Hazard was not up when the Note got on board , his Mate took the Note & carried it below , & return 'd with this Answer to
Capt Parson	PERSON	's Mate , from Capt Hazard Vizt that he need not wait , as Capt Hazard would send an Answer in his own Boat , but said answer has not yet arrived ; since the above Matter has transpired we have treated Capt Hazard with that Contempt & Detestation which every Traitor to the rights of his Country deserves ; .

		it has been & still is in our power to add to his punishment by depriving him of his
Vessell & Cargoe	ORGANIZATION	, as the least intimation of his having flour on board would effect it , but we never mean to leave it in any Man 's power to Tax us with Actions that are purely illnatur 'd , we only mean to do our utmost to preserve to ourselves & posterity , those privelidges , which we never mean to part with but at the expense of our lives & to discountenance & detest the Foes of God & Man ー We are Gentlemen with Sentiments of Esteem Your Brethem & Fellow Sufferers in the Common Cause .

Boston	LOCATION	September 20th 1775 .

		-LRB- No 37 -RRB- Governor -LSB-
George James -RSB- Bruere	PERSON	has sent
Intelligence of Vessels	ORGANIZATION	from the Continent going to
Bermuda	LOCATION	, and carrying away a Quantity of Powder from the Magazine , which some of the
Islanders	ORGANIZATION	had assisted in forceing in the Night .

		There was a suspicion that some Attempt of the kind would be made upon the Island of New-Providence , and an armed Schooner with a Transport are Sailed to bring away the Artillery and Ammunition from that
Island	LOCATION	, and other Ships are Sent to
North-Carolina	LOCATION	to bring off the Artillery in Fort-Johnson .

		I hope to Send Some aid in a short time to
Bermuda	LOCATION	.

		We hear that the Colonies have fitted out several armed Vessels and sent them to
Europe	LOCATION	and the
West Indies	LOCATION	in Search of Ammunition , and there is Advice that a Privateer from
South Carolina	LOCATION	had plundered an Ordnance Ship off the Barr of
St Augustine	LOCATION	, where she was bound with
Military Stores	ORGANIZATION	.

		A body of about 1200 Men was detached some Days ago from the
Rebel Army	ORGANIZATION	as we learn towards
Canada	LOCATION	, by way of the
Chaudiere	LOCATION	.

		They marched to Newbery where they embarked in Sloops and Schooners and as they gave out were to proceed up the
Kennebec	LOCATION	as high as Fort
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		It is impossible without a Defection of the Canadians that they can succeed in any attempt against that Province ; and Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	assures me , that there is a Frigate with two armed Schooners besides some armed Transports in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, and the Somerset of Sixty Guns at
Halifax	LOCATION	, should they attempt Nova-Scotia .

		I mean shortly to send Lieutenant Colonel -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Goreham	PERSON	to
Halifax	LOCATION	with all the Men of his own
Corps	ORGANIZATION	and Colonel
McLean	PERSON	's and two Companys of the 14th Regiment , which with the Recruits expected there from

HOLT	PERSON	'S
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	GAZETTE , WEDNESDAY , SEPTEMBER 20 , 1775
Norfolk	LOCATION	, September 20 .

		We are informed from good authority that a system of justice similar to that adopted against the devoted town of
Boston	LOCATION	, is likely to be established in this colony , by the renowned Commodore of the
Virginia	LOCATION	fleet .

		He has , in the course of this week , as a reprisal for the loss of his tender , seized every vessel belonging to
Hampton	PERSON	that came within his reach , and thereby rendered himself the terror of all the small craft and fishing boats in this river ; especially the latter , having brought some of them under his stern , by a discharge of his cannon at them .

		He has likewise seized a vessel belonging to the Eastern shore , and having honoured the passengers so far with his notice , as to receive them on board his own vessel , took the liberty of sending one of their horses as a present to L -- d
Dunmore	PERSON	.

		1 This act of GENEROSITY we doubt not , will gain him considerable interest with his Lordship , it being an instance of his industry in distressing a people who have of late become so obnoxious to his Excellency for their spirited behaviour .

		We hope that those who have lived under and enjoyed the blessings of the British constitution , will not continue tame spectators of such flagrant violations of its most salutary laws in defence of private property .

		The crimes daily committed by this plunderer we would not willingly brand with the odious name of piracy , but we are confident they come under those offences to which the English laws have denied the benefit of clergy .

		We are just informed that he sent , some days ago , a message to the inhabitants of
Hampton	LOCATION	, with a proposal that if they would return the stores , & c. taken on board the tender , he would molest them no longer , but retire peaceably to his old station .

		This proposition being taken under consideration by the principal inhabitants , an answer was returned promising a compliance with the Captain 's request , provided he would deliver up a negro slave belonging to Mr.
Henry King	PERSON	, who has long acted as a pilot to the Otter ; but this the honest Captain , as well on account of the fellow 's knowledge of the rivers as his singular ATTACHMENT and LOYALTY to his sovereign , refused , and , after damning the IMPUDENCE of these people in demanding his Ethiopian director , swore he would make them no other reply than what his cannon could give them ; Accordingly he has taken his station between the two bars to be more convenient for the business .

JOHN PINKNEY	PERSON	, PRINTER OF THE
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	GAZETTE Mr.
Pinkney	PERSON	, -LSB-
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, September 21 -RSB- If you can , please to inform us why the Mercury man of war , which has so long been the terror of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, and a refuge to our slaves , is not yet burnt , notwithstanding she has been ten days and upwards upon her broadside .

		We , sir , who live at a distance , are at a loss how to account for the strange remissness of the inhabitants of
Norfolk	LOCATION	in neglecting to seize the opportunity which Heaven has kindly thrown in their way .

		Surely the interest of the mayor , who , from his letters to -LSB-
John -RSB- Macartney	PERSON	, seems to prefer the friendship of that deceitful enemy to the welfare of the town over which he presides , must have prevented the noble rage of the citizens from bursting forth in vengeance upon that accursed vessel , which they now have in their power to sacrifice for the captain 's bloody threats to destroy their town .

		We can by no means attribute the omission to a partiality in the inhabitants of
Norfolk	LOCATION	to the avowed enemies of our country ; nor can we suppose them so far destitute of courage as to be afraid to make the attempt .

		But let the cause be what it will , we do inform them , through the channel of your intelligence , that unless they immediately perform this act , so ardently wished for by their countrymen , and so easily to be effected , that Thousands are resolved to burn the devoted vessel , even if the consequence of it should be the total ruin of

Pinkney	PERSON	's
Virginia Gazette	ORGANIZATION	, September 21 , 1775 .

		ANONYMOUS LETTER TO
JOHN PINKNEY	PERSON	Mr.
Pinkney	PERSON	, -LSB-
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, September 21 -RSB- We are highly pleased with the conduct of the people of
South Carolina	LOCATION	, who have taken the troops destined for
Virginia	LOCATION	from
Saint Augustine	PERSON	, and think ourselves the more obliged to those brave Carolinians , 2 as those troops were to have been a reinforcement to the sixty men who have been so very formidable to the towns of
Norfolk	LOCATION	,
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, and
Gosport	LOCATION	.

		What might have been the consequence had they arrived !

		But to be serious : How long will the inhabitants of those Towns suffer themselves to be so shamefully insulted by l -- d D ----- e -LSB- Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	-RSB- and the Captains of the men of war ?

		To what is it owing that their committees have so unaccountably acquitted some late extraordinary delinquents ?

		Is it to a want of zeal in the glorious cause , or of spirit to prosecute it ?

		But we trust that the people of
Norfolk	LOCATION	will remove our doubts and jealousies , and wipe off every stain on their characters , by making a proper use of the golden opportunity Heaven has now afforded them .

		To do this nothing is requisite but a little spirit , with some address and ingenuity in the application of it .

		A number of small vessels may be easily fitted out as fire ships , and may be used with almost certainty of success , and without the least risk of lives on our part .

		Nor can the most loyal of his majesty 's subjects condemn this measure , since it is but a proper chastisement of the most despicable tools of his greatest enemies ; nor can humanity forbid it , because it is dictated by some of its first feelings , an honest indignation , and the love of our country , and is en joined by the first law of nature .

		When king , lords , and commons , have combined to enslave us ; when a corrupt and abandoned
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	have voted their lives and fortunes at the service of a perfidious , cruel , and bloody administration , in the execution of their wicked plan ; when , in consequence of this , fleets and armies are sent against us , which have pillaged our coasts , bombarded our towns , and but for the glorious intrepedity of our countrymen , under the particular favour and protection of the Almighty , would have spread desolation throughout our land ; when we consider the damnable plot that has been laid against us , of stirring up the Canadians and Indians to attack us on our frontiers , and our slaves and tories within the body of our country , whilst their fleets were to lay waste our coasts ; and when we have seen this plan recommended in a pamphlet written by an accursed pensioner , Doctor -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Johnson	PERSON	, by the order of the minister , and under the particular patronage of the king ; when we consider these things , who can hesitate a moment to declare that we ought to do all in our power to be revenged on such an administration , and to hurl down destruction on all the infernal tools ?

		Let not our countrymen think that captain
Macartney	PERSON	deserves more indulgence than captain
Squire	PERSON	, or lord
Dunmore	PERSON	: He , like captain
Montague	PERSON	, has taken upon himself to interfere with the civil power , has impudently supposed that his presence could awe a committet ; 1 and protect a culprit , and has wickedly threatened to fire on a defenceless town .

		But let captain
Macartney	PERSON	know , that whenever he lands in
Virginia	LOCATION	he is amenable to the laws of
Virginia	LOCATION	, which may punish him as a trespasser , rioter , or murderer , or as a rebel , if he should , like l -- d D ----- e and
Squire	PERSON	, attempt to raise an insurrection ; and we would have all those tools of government to know , that , whenever they return to
England	LOCATION	, we shall try the full force of the English laws against all such offences as they have or shall commit here .

		The American governors shall severely answer for their conduct in the King 's Bench , and judges shall remember the fate of
Epsom	LOCATION	and
Dudley	PERSON	.

JOSIAH QUINCY	PERSON	TO
JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- Sept 22d 1775 .

		In my former Letter I said , that `` the Harbor -LSB- of
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- might be blocked up ; and both Seamen and Soldiers made Prisoners at Discretion '' ; which seems to you incredible : ー Please , to read at your Leasure the following Explanation : ー There are but two Channels , through which Ships of Burthen can pass to and from
Boston	LOCATION	: ー One of them runs between .

		the west Head of
Long Island	LOCATION	, and the Moon , -LRB- so called -RRB- and is about a Mile across : ー This Channel is too shallow for any Ships of War above 20 Guns : ー The other runs between the east Head of
Long Island	LOCATION	, and the
south Point of Deer Island	LOCATION	; and is about a Mile & half from Side to Side : ー This , the only
Channel	ORGANIZATION	through which capital Ships can pass , leads -LRB- outward bound -RRB- through the Narrows -LRB- so called -RRB- between
Gallop 's Island	LOCATION	and
Lovel 's Island	LOCATION	; where the Channel is not wider , than the Length of a 50 Gun Ship .

		ー In the opening between
Gallops Island & George 's Island	LOCATION	, is
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	; where , one , is always , and at present , five Men of War are stationed , to gaurd the Narrows from being stop 'd up : Upon the foregoing Facts , I thus reason : The
Moon Island	LOCATION	communicates with
Squantum Neck	ORGANIZATION	; at low Water , almost dry shod : A defensible Fort , therefore , upon
Squantum	LOCATION	, may be so placed , as to secure a Retreat not only from the Moon , but from
Squantum	LOCATION	to the Main : ー one upon the east Head of the Moon , and another , if found necessary , upon the west Head of
Long Island	LOCATION	, secures the Passage between , and covers a Retreat from the Latter to the Former : Another upon the Summit in the middle of
Long Island	LOCATION	covers the Shore on each Side ; so , as that no Force can land without being greatly anoyed , if not entirely prevented .

		Another strong Battery from 20 to 40 Peices of heavy Cannon at the east Head of
Long Island	LOCATION	; commands , not only the Ship Channel , but the Narrows , and
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	, so that no Ship can remain there with Safety ; and consequently , by sinking Hulks in the Narrows we might prevent any Ship of Force from going out or coming in .

		ー If the Passage thro ' the Narrows is not stop 'd , I am sensible , a Ship with a fresh Gale of Wind , and flood or Ebb Tide , which is rapid between
Long Island & deer Island	LOCATION	, might run through without any great Hazard ; but , after the east Head of
Long Island	LOCATION	is fortified , I can forsee Nothing to hinder , the Narrows being reduced to such a Draught of Water , as that , no Vessel of any considerable Force , can pass through there ー This , being effected ; as I said above , both Seamen and Soldiers , if they dont escape , by a timely Flight , must become Prisoners at Discretion .

		I have been told , there is in one of the English Magazines , an accurate Draft of the Harbor : ー If you can procure it , upon Examination , you may determin -LSB- e -RSB- , the Distance and Depth of Water between the
Islands	LOCATION	aforesd with Precision ; and consequently , whether such a Scheme is practicable or not .

		I have thought , and said from the Beginning , that Row Gallies must be our first mode of Defence by Sea ; it gives me therefore , Pleasure to hear , our worthy Friend Doctr F -LSB- rankli -RSB- n is employed in constructing some for the City of
Phildia	LOCATION	: ー I wish I had the same Employment here ; for I am very sure , twenty of them , under proper Direction , would have taken or destroyed all those Cruisers and Cutters , that have infested , and done so much Damage in the Vineyard & long Island Sounds in the Course of the Summer past ; besides , being a safe Convoy to our Provision Vessels .

		ー When I first proposed the Scheme to our Comtee of Safety , it was objected , that , we had no Body skilled in the Construction of them : Afterwards I heard of a Ship
Carpenter	PERSON	, just escaped from
Boston	LOCATION	, who had been several Years a Prisoner in a turkish Row Galley , and had formed a compleat three feet Model of one : ー It was then objected , that , heavy Cannon , and Powder were wanting : ー An insuperable Objection , most certainly ; which I hope will soon be removed .

		Several Vessels have lately arrived in
Boston	LOCATION	from
England	LOCATION	; but the News they bring is industriously secreted : ー The sullen Silence , and dejected Countenances of the Officers , give Rise to various Conjectures : ー God grant : the Truth may be a Dissolution of a venal P-t , a disbanded
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and an Order for the Ships and Troops here to return imediately Home .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	Sept 22 .

		1775 ー By your Letter June 24 , indosing a Copy of Mr Grants Letter to the
Victualling Board	ORGANIZATION	, I am acquainted that their Lordships desire to know by the first Conveyance what is the State of my Provisions for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, what further Supplies may be necessary , and when and where I would have them sent .

		In my Letter August 19 I mentioned generally our Situation and Dependence with respect to Provisions , and I wrote somewhat more particularly to the
Victualling Board	ORGANIZATION	, a Copy of which is now inclosed .

		I inclose also an account of Provisions belonging to the
Contractor in Store	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	for the use of the Fleet .

		But it must be remembered that we have no reliance on that Scheme of baking Bread this Winter at
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Wood is and will be too scarce and dear , it is now from six to eight Dollars a Cord ; and I really do not believe it will be possible for the Agent to bake either Loaves or Biscuit , whatever he may think .

		It will be difficult to provide Fuel to brew Spruce Beer for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	; but this they may depend upon having both here and at
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		I do not find the
New York	LOCATION	people have yet refused to give the Asia Provisions .

		It is thought
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and the
Carolinas	LOCATION	will not furnish much longer .

		The Ships at
Virginia	LOCATION	still get Supplies .

		At
Rhode Island	LOCATION	the Contract has totally failed .

		At
Quebec	LOCATION	provisions are dear , but the few Ships that go there will get what is required .

		But although his Majesty 's Ships to the Southward are furnished with provisions at present , may it not be to prevent Supplies being sent from
England	LOCATION	, in order by discontinuing suddenly in the middle of Winter to involve the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	in the deepest distress ?

		The resolves of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	respecting nonimportation & c will greatly impede our having provisions regularly .

		Upon the whole I beg leave to offer it as my opinion that we should not rely upon the Continent of
North America	LOCATION	for Supplies of Provisions this Winter .

		Their Lordships have already been pleased to order a proportion of 5000 men for four Months , except Spirits , to be sent here without Delay .

		The Ships that come to
America	LOCATION	in future may bring what they can conveniently stow ; and we are provided until the end of February if the Friendship Victualler , one of the first four , arrives safe .

		I should be glad that our Supplies may be sent to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	,
Halifax	LOCATION	, or
Boston	LOCATION	; And , if their Lordships please , the Transports may be ordered to go to either of these places as Winds and Weather may suit .

		Being on the Subject of provisions it indispensably becomes my Duty to represent to their Lordships that the custom of supplying
New England	LOCATION	Rum to his Majesty 's Ships is in my humble opinion highly prejudicial to the State .

		The use of it destroys the Health and Faculties of the People , and debilitates them surprizinzly .

		The Seamen always continue healthy and active when drinking spruce Beer ; but in a few days after
New England	LOCATION	Rum is served , although mixed with four or five Waters , the Hospital is crouded with sick , and those on board are pallid , weak , and incapable of doing half their Duty .

		I appeal to the
Captains of the Squadron	ORGANIZATION	that this is always the Consequence of their Crews having
New England	LOCATION	Rum .

		It is indeed beyond Contradiction .

		At present the Want of fuel will in some measure prevent distilling ; But it is a melancholy Consideration that the Seamen in his Majesty 's Service must use the most pernicious of all Liquors , and that too often in its very worst State .

		Upon Inquiry I find that the current price of Rum at
Boston	LOCATION	from the
Windward Islands	LOCATION	has been from 22d to two Shillings sterling p Gallon by the single Cask , and that good
Jamaica	LOCATION	Rum never exceeds half a Crown a Gallon , but has heen generally sold at two Shillings and three pence .

		I therefore eamesty hope their Lordships will be pleased to take this matter into Consideration , and that in all future Contracts , good merchantable Rum from the
West India Islands	LOCATION	may be furnished to the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	and not less than six months old .

J.S. Journey to Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, have therefore credited your Accot therewith altho : 't was an Extra : Expence attending the loading as had we bot it here , the diff .

Surpriz	PERSON	'd that the Cargo was not in good Order for by our Letters from Gib -LSB- raltar -RSB- it was good when leaving that port , we observe the Trouble you were like to have with

Sidney	PERSON	was old , but till this Voyage had carried her Cargoes Safe & always made Short passages , & from the Accot we have from the
Boatswain	PERSON	who has return 'd from her , would have gone Safe now but for the Captns Death .

		we Shall think it very hard if She is condemn 'd , we presume if She is , that
Murray	PERSON	must take her for the Charges he has against the Ship .

		for the Expences he charges against the Cargo we Suppose you will be only oblig 'd to pay a part , whatever you do pay you 'll have your Accots properly authenticated & Send them to
Messr Mildred & Roberts	ORGANIZATION	who with your friends will undoubtedly recover it from the Insurers , they we are Sure must pay whatever Expence attended her in Gib -LSB- raltar -RSB- , if proper protests are made out , you 'll take Care to get from

		From
Joshua Barney	PERSON	's account ,
Murray	PERSON	was not a rascal , but a valued friend , and the merchants at
Nice	ORGANIZATION	, to whom the cargo of the
Sidney	PERSON	was consigned were the `` real villains in the piece . ''

		After early promises to pay the
Murray	PERSON	bills , they then refused on the grounds that as
Barney	PERSON	was a minor his bond was illegal .

		Part of the cargo had been landed when the refusal was communicated to him , so
Barney	PERSON	clamped down the hatches and kept the remainder of the wheat onboard .

		This brought an order to appear before the Governor , who had him jailed , and threatened to confiscate the ship , but with a promise of release for the young mariner if he would permit the remaining cargo to be landed .

		Concluding that to sit in prison would not help the situation ,
Barney	PERSON	agreed to the demand ; was freed , went on board the
Sidney	LOCATION	and claiming that a promise under duress was not binding , still refused to open the hatches .

		The Governor sent an officer and soldiers , whereupon
Barney	PERSON	took his whole crew ashore , and surrendered the ship , with the British flag still flying .

		Then , with the younger
Murray	PERSON	, he crossed the
Alps	LOCATION	to
Milan	LOCATION	, then the capital of
Sardinia	LOCATION	, and laid his case before Sir
William Lynch	PERSON	, the British Ambassador .

		An appeal by the Ambassador to the
Sardinian Court	ORGANIZATION	brought quick results , and
Barney	PERSON	, with
Murray	PERSON	, returned in triumph to
Nice	LOCATION	, where a subdued Governor gave him possession of the
Sydney	LOCATION	, and
Vierne & Veillon	ORGANIZATION	hastened to discharge the
Murray	PERSON	bond .

		Whereupon the remainder of the cargo was landed , and
Barney	PERSON	sailed from
Nice	ORGANIZATION	in June .

		INTELLIGENCE FROM
NEW BERN	LOCATION	,
NORTH CAROLINA	LOCATION	, FRIDAY , SEPTEMBER 22 , 1775 This week will ever be remembered as the most remarkable epoch in the annals of this Country , for the discovery of the grand repository and dark depositum of Govern our
Martin	PERSON	's infernal magazine , which , with cool deliberation , he intended to deal out , in missive weapons of death , to the good people of this Province .

		In the Palace garden , and under a fine bed of cabbages , was discovered and dug up a barrel containing about three bushels of gunpowder ; in the
Palace	ORGANIZATION	cellar was also dug up two quarter-casks of the same commodity ー the casks quite new , and marked
R. B	PERSON	.

		In the Palace garden was also dug up about cne thousand weight of musket balls , lately cast ; about five hundred weight of iron swivel balls ; a large quantity of small shot , lead , iron , worms for the cannon , with swabs , rammers , artillery boxes , matches , and the whole apparatus for his park of artillery , which he would have certainly mounted at the Palace , had not the appearance of the people of the Town of
Newbern	PERSON	, on his attempting to move the Palace guns , driven him from the trenches before he had made them quite tenable .

		It is said his Excellency , the night before he took his precipitate flight from the Palace , buried these engines of death , as they might remain in places of safety till he or his creatures might have an opportunity to use them .

		The Palace cannon , it is said , were spiked up after his Excellency left the Palace , by a person who , no doubt , will be obliged to answer for his conduct .

		As it is improbable the Governour could procure these deadly weapons without assistance , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of this Town and County are using their utmost diligence to discover the authors of so black a treachery .

New York	LOCATION	Septr 23rd 1775 Sir , I understand that you have detained on board your Ship Ensign
Edward Tyley	PERSON	, on suspicion of his being aiding and assisting in burning the Barge belonging to the
Asia	LOCATION	, on or about the 12th of July last .

		It was an unhappy piece of business and much against my mind .

		But upon hearing the particulars I doubt not you will be convinced that Mr
Tyley	PERSON	not only had no hand in it , but exerted his utmost efforts to prevent it .

		At that time I had a quantity of Provisions in a Store on that Slip , where there was a small guard , kept under the care of
Ensign Tyley	PERSON	.

		The Sloop which brought the Provisions lay at that place , the Master of which seeing the Barge come in there , suspected they had a design against him , and with the advice of a number of People who had collected , was determined to take the Barge with the men in her .

		I understood in the time of it , both from
Ensign Tyley	PERSON	and the
Bargemen	LOCATION	that
Tyley	PERSON	did every thing in his power to prevent it , but finding it impossible to withstand the torrent , he escorted the men to me Upon hearing of this affair from him , and the Bargemen -LRB- who among other things told me that they did not know but they should have lost their lives had it not been for EnsignTyley -LSB- -RRB- -RSB- , I ordered
Ensign Tyley	PERSON	with a large party to conduct the men back , to put the Barge into the Water and to see every thing that belonged to her was returned , for what happened afterwards I must refer to you the inclosed Affidavits , 2 and when you have duly considered of the affair with all its circumstances ー I flatter myself that from your wonted candour and generosity , you will liberate Mr

		At present it appears to me that if the two Ships with Emigrants had been compelled to anchor close to the

		It is not necessary I am sure to acquaint you that men from any other Country coming to

		NARRATIVE OF COLONEL
ETHAN ALLEN	PERSON	-LSB-
Montreal	LOCATION	, September 25 -RSB- My whole party , at this time , consisted of about one hundred and ten men , near eighty of whom were Canadians .

		We were the most of the night crossing the river , as we had so few canoes that they had to pass and re-pass three times , to carry my party across .

		Soon after day-break , I set a guard between me and the town with special orders to let no person whatever pass or re-pass them , and another guard on the other end of the road , with like directions ; in the mean time , I reconnoitered the best ground to make a defence , expecting Col.
Brown	PERSON	's party was landed on the other side of the town , he having the day before , agreed to give three huzzas with his men early in the morning , which signal I was to return , that we might each know that both parties were landed ; but the sun , by this time , being near two hours high , and the sign failing , I began to conclude myself to be in a premunire , and would have crossed the river back again , but I knew the enemy would have discovered such an attempt ; and , as there could not more than one third part of my troops cross at one time , the other two thirds would of course fall into their hands .

		This I could not reconcile to my own feelings as a man , much less as an officer : I therefore concluded to maintain the ground , if possible , and all to fare alike .

		In consequence of this resolution , I dispatched two messengers , one to
La Prairie	LOCATION	, to Col.
Brown	PERSON	, and the other to L'Assomption , a French settlement , to Mr.
Walker	PERSON	, who was in our interest , requesting their speedy assistance , giving them , at the same time , to understand my critical situation : In the mean time , sundry persons came to my guards , pretending to be friends , but were by them taken prisoners and brought to me .

		These I ordered to confinement , till their friendship could be farther confirmed ; for I was jealous they were spies , as they proved to be afterwards : One of the principal of them making his escape , exposed the weakness of my party , which was the final cause of my misfortune ; for I have been since informed that Mr.
Walker	PERSON	, agreeable to my desire , exerted himself , and had raised a considerable number of men for my assistance , which brought him into difficulty afterwards ; but , upon hearing of my misfortune , he disbanded them again .

		The town of
Montreal	LOCATION	was in a great tumult .

		Gen.
Carlton	PERSON	and the royal party , made every preparation to go on board their vessels of force , as I was afterwards informed , but the spy , escaping from my guard to the town , occasioned an alteration in their policy , and emboldened Gen.
Carlton	PERSON	to send the force , which he had there collected , out against me .

		I had previously chosen my ground , but when I saw the number of the enemy , as they sallied out of the town , I perceived it would be a day of trouble , if not of rebuke ; but I had no chance to flee , as
Montreal	LOCATION	was situated on an island , and the river St.
Lawrence	PERSON	cut off my communication to Gen.
Montgomery	PERSON	's camp .

		I encouraged my soldiery to bravely defend themselves , that we should soon have help , and that we should be able to keep the ground , if no more ー This , and much more , I affirmed with the greatest seeming assurance , and which in reality I thought to be in some degree probable .

		The enemy consisted of not more than forty regular troops , together with a mixed multitude , chiefly Canadians , with a number of English who lived in the town , and some Indians ; in all to the number of near five hundred .

		The reader will notice that most of my party were Canadians ; indeed , it was a motley parcel of soldiery which composed both parties .

		However , the enemy began the attack from wood-piles , ditches , buildings , and such-like places , at a considerable distance , and I returned the fire from a situation more than equally advantageous .

		The attack began betw_een two and three of the clock in the afternoon , just before which I ordered a volunteer by the name of
Richard Young	PERSON	, with a detachment of men as a flank guard , which , under the cover of the bank of the river , could not only annoy the enemy , but at the same time , serve as a flank guard to the left of the main body .

		The fire continued for some time on both sides ; and I was confident that such a remote method of attack could not carry the ground , provided it should be continued till night : But near half of the body of the enemy began to flank round to my right ; upon which I ordered a volunteer , by the name of
John Dugan	PERSON	, who had lived many years in
Canada	LOCATION	, and understood the French language , to detach about fifty of the Canadians , and post himself at an advantageous ditch , which was on my right , to prevent my being surrounded : He advanced with the detachment , but , instead of occupying the post , made his escape , as did like wise Mr.
Young	PERSON	upon the left , with their detachments .

		I soon perceived that the enemy was in possession of the ground , which
Dugan	PERSON	should have occupied .

		At this time I had but about forty-five men with me , some of whom were wounded ; the enemy kept closing round me , nor was it in my power to prevent it ; by which means , my situation , which was advantageous in the first part of the attack , ceased to be so in the last , and , being almost entirely surrounded with such vast unequal numbers , I ordered a retreat , but found that those of the enemy who were of the country , and their Indians , could run as fast as my men , though the regulars could not .

		Thus I retreated near a mile , and some of the enemy , with the savages , kept flanking me , and others crowded hard in the rear .

		In fine , I expected , in a very short time , to try the world of spirits : for I was apprehensive that no quarter would be given to me , and therefore had determined to sell my life as dear as I could .

		One of the enemy 's officers , boldly pressing in the rear , discharged his fusee at me ; the ball whistled near me , as did many others that day .

		I returned the salute , and missed him , as running had put us both out of breath ; for I conclude we were not frightened ; I then saluted him with my tongue in a harsh manner , and told him that , inasmuch as his numbers were so far superior to mine , I would surrender , provided I could be treated with honor , and be assured of good quarter for myself and the men who were with me ; and he answered I should ; another officer , coming up directly after , confirmed the treaty ; upon which I agreed to surrender with my party , which then consisted of thirtyone effective men , and seven wounded .

		I ordered them to ground their arms , which they did .

		The officer I capitulated with , then directed me and my party to advance towards him , which was done ; I handed him my sword , and in half a minute after , a savage , part of whose head was shaved , being almost naked and painted , with feathers intermixed with the hair of the other side of his head , came running to me with an incredible swiftness ; he seemed to advance with more than mortal speed ; as he approached near me , his hellish visage was beyond all description ; snakes ' eyes appear innocent in comparison of his ; his features distorted ; malice , death , murder , and the wrath of devils and damned spirits are the emblems of his countenance ; and , in less than twelve feet of me , presented his firelock ; at the instant of his present , I twitched the officer , to whom I gave my sword , between me and the savage ; but he flew round with great fury , trying to single me out to shoot me without killing the officer ; but by this time I was near as nimble as he , keeping the officer in such a position that his danger was my defence ; but , in less than half a minute , I was attacked by just such another imp of hell : Then I made the officer fly round with incredible velocity , for a few seconds of time , when I perceived a Canadian , who had lost one eye , as appeared afterwards , taking my part against the savages ; and in an instant an Irishman came to my assistance with a fixed bayonet , and drove away the fiends , swearing by
Jasus	PERSON	he would kill them .

		This tragic scene composed my mind .

		The escaping from so awful a death made even imprisonment happy ; the more so as my conquerors on the field treated me with great civility and politeness .

		The regular officers said that they were very happy to see Col.
Allen	PERSON	: I answered them , that I should rather chose to have seen them at Gen.
Montgomery	PERSON	's camp .

		The gentlemen replied , that they gave full credit to what I said , and , as I walked to the town , which was , as I should guess , more than two miles , a British officer walking at my right hand , and one of the French noblesse at my left ; the latter of which , in the action , had his eye brow carried away by a glancing shot , but was nevertheless very merry and facetious , and no abuse was offered me till I came to the barrack-yard , at
Montreal	LOCATION	, where I met general -LSB-
Richard -RSB- Prescott	PERSON	, who asked me my name , which I told him : He then asked me , whether I was that Col.
Allen	PERSON	who took
Ticonderoga	PERSON	.

		I told him I was the very man : Then he shook his cane over my head , calling many hard names , among which he frequently used the word rebel , and put himself in a great rage .

		I told him he would do well not to cane me , for I was not accustomed to it , and shook my fist at him , telling him that was the beetle of mortality for him , if he offered to strike ; upon which Capt.
M'Cloud	PERSON	of the British , pulled him by the skirt and whispered to him , as he afterwards told me , to this import : that it was inconsistent with his honor to strike a prisoner .

		He then ordered a sergeant 's command with fixed bayonets to come forward , and kill thirteen Canadians , which were included in the treaty aforesaid .

		It cut me to the heart to see the Canadians in so hard a case , in consequence of their having been true to me ; they were wringing their hands , saying their prayers , as I concluded , and expected immediate death .

		I therefore stepped between the executioners and the Canadians , opened my clothes , and told General
Prescott	PERSON	to thrust his bayonet into my breast , for I was the sole cause of the Canadians taking up arms .

		The guard in the mean time , rolling their eye balls from the General to me , as though impatiently waiting his dread commands to sheath their bayonets in my heart ; I could however plainly discern , that he was in a suspence and quandary about the matter : This gave me additional hopes of succeeding ; for my design was not to die , but to save the Canadians by a finesse .

		The general stood a minute , when he made me the following reply : `` I will not execute you now , but you shall grace a halter at
Tyburn	LOCATION	, God damn you . ''

		I remember I disdained his mentioning such a place ; I was , notwithstanding , a little pleased with the expression , as it significantly conveyed to me the idea of postponing the present appearance of death ; besides , his sentence was by no means final , as to `` gracing a halter , '' although I had anxiety about it after I landed in
England	LOCATION	, as the reader will find in the course of this history .

		Gen.
Prescott	PERSON	then ordered one of his officers to take me on board the Gaspee schooner of war , and confine me , hands and feet , in irons , which was done the same afternoon I was taken .

		The action continued an hour and three quarters , by the watch , and I know not to this day how many of my men were killed , though I am certain there were but few !

		if I remember right , seven were wounded ; one of them ,
William Stewart	PERSON	, by name , was wounded by a savage with a tomahawk , after he was taken prisoner and disarmed , but was rescued by some of the generous enemy ; and so far recovered of his wounds , that he afterwards went with the other prisoners to
England	LOCATION	.

		Of the enemy were killed , a Major
Carden	PERSON	, who had been wounded in eleven different battles , and an eminent merchant ,
Patterson	PERSON	, of
Montreal	LOCATION	, and some others , but I never knew their whole loss , as their accounts were different .

		I am apprehensive that it is rare , that so much ammunition was expended , and so little execution done by it ; though such of my party as stood the ground , behaved with great fortitude , much exceeding that of the enemy , but were not the best of marksmen , and , I am apprehensive , were all killed or taken ; the wounded were all put into the hospital at
Montreal	LOCATION	, and those that were not , were put on board of different vessels in the river , and shackled together by pairs , viz. two men fastened together by one hand cuff , being closely fixed to one wrist of each of them , and treated with the greatest severity , nay as criminals .

		I now come to the description of the irons , which were put on me : The hand-cuff was of a common size and form , but my leg irons , I should imagine would weigh thirty pounds ; the bar was eight feet long , and very substantial ; the shackles which encompassed my ancles , were very tight .

		I was told by the officer who put them on , that it was the king 's plate , and I heard other of their officers say that it would weigh forty weight .

		The irons were so close upon my ancles , that I could not lie down in any other manner than on my back .

		I was put into the lowest and most wretched part of the vessel , where I got the favor of a chest to sit on ; the same answered for my bed at night ; 1 .

		May it please your Excellency , My last of the 19th Inst .

		from
Newbury Port	LOCATION	, advising of the Embarkation of the Troops , I make no Doubt , your Excellency received .

		The same Day we left
Newbury	LOCATION	, and arrived safe in the
River	LOCATION	next Morning , except a small Vessel which run on the Rocks , but is since off , without Damage and arrived safe .

		I found the Batteaus compleated , but many of them smaller than the Directions given , and very badly built ー of Course I have been obliged to order twenty more to bring on the Remainder of the Provisions which will be finished in three Days .

		Many of the Vessels were detained in the River by running aground , and head Winds , which delayed us a Day or two .

		The 23d Inst .

		I dispatched
Lieut -LSB- Archibald -RSB- Steel of Capt. -LSB- Matthew -RSB- Smith	PERSON	's Company with 6 Men in two Birch Canoes to
Chaudiere Pond	LOCATION	to reconnoitre and get all the Intelligence he possibly could from the Indians who I find are hunting there .

		The same Day I dispatched
Lieutt Church	ORGANIZATION	and seven Men with a Surveyor & Pilot to take the Exact Courses and Distances to the
Dead River	LOCATION	so called , a Branch of the
Kennebec	LOCATION	, and yesterday the three
Companies of Rifle-Men	ORGANIZATION	under the
Command of Capt.	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
Daniel -RSB- Morgan	PERSON	embarked with forty five Days Provisions as an advanced

		Col : Green -LSB-

		Major
Meggs	PERSON	-LSB- Return
Jonathan Meigs	PERSON	-RSB- goes off tomorrow with the third Division , and Col : -LSB-
Roger	PERSON	-RSB- Enos the next Day , with the Remainder .

		As soon as the whole are embarked , I propose taking a Birch Canoe , and joining the advanced Party .

		I have found it necessary to divide the Detachment for the Conveniency of passing the Carrying the -LSB- sic -RSB- Places , at the first of which there are some Carriages to be procured .

		I design Chaudiere Pond as a general
Rendesvouze	PERSON	, and from thence to march in a Body .

		Inclosed is a Letter to Mr
Coburn	PERSON	, from the
Party	ORGANIZATION	sent to
Quebec	LOCATION	, by which your Excellency will see all the
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	I have received .

		I have conversed with the
Party	ORGANIZATION	, who saw only one Indian , one
Nattaries	LOCATION	, a Native of
Norridgwalk	LOCATION	, a noted Villain , and very little Credit , I am told is to be given to his Information .

		The Indians with
Higgens	PERSON	set out by Land , and are not yet arrived .

		I have engaged a Number of good Pilots , and believe by the best Information I can procure , we shall be able to perform the March in twenty Days .

		The Distance about 180 Miles .

		I intended Col : Green should have gone on with the first Division of one Company of Rifle-men , and two Companies of Musketeers .

		This was objected to by the Captains of the Rifle-Companies , who insist on being commanded by no other Person than Capt.
Morgan	PERSON	and myself .

		This Capt.
Morgan	PERSON	tells me was your Excellency 's Intention .

		But as I was not made acquainted with it before I came away , I should be very glad of particular Instructions on that Head , that I may give Satisfaction to the Field Officers with me .

		There is at present the greatest Harmony among the Officers , and no Accident happened , except the Loss of one Man ; supposed to be wilfully shot by a private , who is now taking his Trial by a Court Martial .

		Major -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Mifflin	PERSON	could not send Money for the
Batteaus	PERSON	, the Commissary has been obliged to pay for them with one Hundred Pounds I have lent him , out of the Pay received for the Month of Sepr , and has been obliged to draw an Order in Favour of the Bearer Mr
John Wood	PERSON	who has engaged to deliver this to your Excellency .

		I have promised him his Time & Expences paid .

		I should be glad the Manifestoes might be forwarded by him if not sent by the last Intelligence from
Genl Schuyler	PERSON	, to whom I intend sending one of the Indians as soon as they arrive .

		I have the Honour to be & c

Court Martial	ORGANIZATION	have condemned the Man who shot the other to be hanged , which Sentence I have approved , but have respited him , until your Excellency Pleasure in the Matter be known , and design sending him back in one of the Transports .

		Enclosed are all the Papers relative to the Matter , with his Confession at the Gallows before respited .

		The three first Divisions of my Detachment are gone forward ー the last goes tomorrow , when I shall join Capt.

		Gentlemen ー One of our boats -LRB- employed to watch the motions of the fleet and army at

		in the morning , off the harbour of

		Our boatmen could not , with any safety , go near enough to make a perfect discovery , but we apprehend they are part of a fleet destined for
Suffolk county	LOCATION	, for the purpose of getting more stock .

		We give you this notice to the end that you may be prepared to protect the stock and prevent their being taken off , if possible ... Please send copies of this by express , to the committees of

		We have already been confined three weeks , and the reason of it is , we hear , that you have sent for evidence to our parts , which we think is a sufficient time for such evidence to have been here , if there was any .

		Gentlemen , we beg you would consider our case as your own , and do by others as you would be done by , for therein a man fulfilleth the law of God .

		We will endeavour to set forth the unhappy condition we are in , confined to a room , which indeed we think a great hardship ; spending our money at a great rate , more than our ability will allow ; deprived from our business and our families , and our children are not yet capable of maintaining themselves ; there are no less than twenty-one children belonging to three of us here confined , and the eldest not exceeding twelve years .

		Besides , the Esopus people have took Christian and
Adam Bergh	PERSON	's sloop from their landing , and , as we are credibly informed , have sold her for the use of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and God knows whether they have not stripped their families of all ;
Dop	PERSON	's sloop is burned , with a great many of our wearing apparel ; all which has been done before we are brought to trial , and before it is known whether we are guilty of any crime ; and , farther , we all have taken very bad colds .

JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	' NOTES OF DEBATES IN THE
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	CONGRESS 1775 Monday .

		Sept. 24 -LSB- i.e. 25 -RSB- .

		An Uneasiness , among some of the Members concerning a Contract with
Willing & Morris	ORGANIZATION	, for Powder , by which the
House	ORGANIZATION	, without any Risque at all will make a clear Profit of 12,000 # at least .


Dyer	PERSON	and
Deane	PERSON	spoke in public ,
Lewis	PERSON	to me in private about it .

		All think it exorbitant .


S. Adams	PERSON	desired that the Resolve of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, upon which the Contract was founded might be read : he did not recollect it .


De Hart	PERSON	.

		One of the Contractors , Willing , declared to this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that he looked upon the Contract to be that the first Cost should be insured to them , not the 14 # a Barrell for the Powder .


R. R. Livingston	PERSON	.

		I never will vote to ratify the Contract in the sense that
Morris	PERSON	understands it .

		Willing .

		I am a Member of the
House	ORGANIZATION	, a Party to the Contract , but was not privy to the Bargain .

		I never saw the Contract , untill I saw it in Dr.
Franklins Hand	PERSON	.

		I think it ensures only the first Cost .

		My Partner thinks it ensures the whole .

		He says that Mr.
Rutledge	PERSON	said at the
Time	ORGANIZATION	, that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should have nothing to do with Sea risque .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of this City offered 19 # .

		I would wish to have nothing to do with the Contract : but to leave it to my Partner , who is a Man of Reason and Generosity , to explain the Contract with the Gentlemen who made it with him .


J. Rutledge	PERSON	.


Congress	ORGANIZATION	was to run no Risque only vs. Men of War and Customhouse officers .

		I was surprized this Morning to hear that Mr.
Morris	PERSON	understood it otherwise .

		If he wont execute a Bond , such as We shall draw , I shall not be at a loss what to do .


Johnson	PERSON	.

		An hundred Ton of Powder was wanted .


Ross	PERSON	.

		In Case of its Arrival
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was to pay # 14 .

		If Men of War , or Custom house officers , should get it ,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was to pay first Cost only as I understood it .

		Zubly .

		We are highly favoured .

		14 # We are to give if We get the Powder : and 14 # if We dont get it .

		I understand Persons enough will contract to supply Powder at 15 # and run all risques .

		Willing .

		Sorry any Gentlemen should be severe .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	's Character is such that he can not deserve it .


Lynch	PERSON	.

		If
Morris	PERSON	will execute the Bond , well , if not the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	will report .


Deane	PERSON	.

		It is very well that this matter has been moved and that so much has been said upon it .


Dyer	PERSON	.

		There are not Ten Men in the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	I come from , who are worth so much Money as will be made clear by this Contract .


Ross	PERSON	.

		What has this Matter to -LSB- do with -RSB- the present debate , whether Connecticutt Men are worth much or no .

		It proves there are no Men there whose Capital or Credit are equal to such Contracts .

		That is all .


Harrison	PERSON	.

		The Contract is made and the Money paid .

		How can We get it back ?


Johnson	PERSON	.

		Let us consider the Prudence of this Contract .

		If it had not been made
Morris	PERSON	would have got 19 # , and not have set forward a second Adventure .


Gadsden	LOCATION	.

		Understands the Contract as
Morris	PERSON	does , and yet thinks it a prudent one , because
Morris	PERSON	would have got 19 # .

		EDWARD HAY TO VICE ADMIRAL JAMES YOUNG A Copy Barbados 25th September 1775 .

		Sir .

		I have the honour to receive your Letter of 30th Augt by Capt. -LSB-
Francis Grant -RSB- Gordon	PERSON	, Commander of His Majestys ' Ship Argo , to acquaint me that you have certain intelligence , that several Vessels belonging to
North America	LOCATION	, go to the Dutch French , & Spanish Islands in these Seas , and offer unlimited prices for Gunpowder & other
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	; and that you are apprehensive that many of the North American Vessels , which trade to His Majestys '
Caribbee Islands	LOCATION	, may use the like endeavours to purchase Gunpowder & c. in these
Islands	LOCATION	and that the great prices offered may tempt private adventurers to run risks , to the great detriment of His Majestys ' Service , at a time when the North Americans are in open rebellion .

		To prevent any pernicious Trafick of this nature , in this Island , I will , in compliance with your request , immediately issue a proclamation to forbid .

		the shipping Gunpowder , or other
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	, either Coastwise , or otherwise , by any Ships or Vessels whatever for the Space of Six months ; and I will take the first opportunity of laying your Letter before His Majesty 's Council of this Island , for their advice what other steps may be necessary to be taken , to prevent such projects .

		But I do not apprehend that there is or has been for any time past any considerable quantity of Powder in private hands here ; however it may prevent any future Speculations of this kind .

		I received yesterday a Letter from Mr
Bruyere	PERSON	, Governor of Bermudas , a Copy of which I think it right to send you , though I understand the same person who brought mine delivered a Letter likewise to Captain
Gordon	PERSON	.

		The man who brought it seems either very much frightened , or disturbed in his brain ; I could not make head or tail of his verbal Account , only that the whole
Island	LOCATION	was in a State of Rebellion .

		The Governor 's Letter does not intimate so much , only that the Scheme of carrying away the Powder was formed by a correspondence between some few of the
Island	LOCATION	and those on the Continent .

		But it shews to what length the North Americans are disposed to go in their wicked pursuits , I have the honour to be Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB- NB .

		It does not appear that any Vessel of the
Name of Charles Town & Savannah Packet John Turner	ORGANIZATION	Master hath arrived here since the 15th August .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	26 Sepr 1775 .

		On the 8th instant the
Savage	PERSON	put back with three Vessels seized under the restraining Act for the
Northern Colonies	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the 10th the Hope and
St Lawrence Schooners	ORGANIZATION	arrived from the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	with a Convoy of Transports with forage for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		Governor
Carleton	PERSON	applied to me some time in July last for two of his Majestys Sloops of War , and an additional Number of Shipwrights and Seamen , in order to build Vessels and regain the Navigation of the Lakes and drive out the Rebels , who had invaded the province of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		I was under the necessity of acquainting his Excellency that it was then entirely out of my power to assist him .

		General
Carleton	PERSON	has since picked up the
Gaspee	LOCATION	, and on the Hunters Arrival I immediately determined to lend that Sloop to him also , but the Head of her foremast being sprung , and she wanting other repairs besides a new Mast , she did not sail till the 12th instant .

		I have given Captain
Mackenzie	PERSON	Orders to proceed without a moments loss of time to
Quebec	LOCATION	, and there co-operate with and assist Governor
Carleton	PERSON	to the utmost of his power against the Rebels , to take the
Gaspee	PERSON	under his Command , and to remain in the
River St Lawrence	LOCATION	until further orders .

		The Savage sailed the same time for
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		I inclose the Sentence of a Court Martial held the 11th instant on Captain
Collins	PERSON	, whom I instantly restored to the Command of the Nautilus .

		I can not avoid expressing my disapprobation of the Court , considering mulcting an Officer for breach of Orders , where there has been no peculation , to be an improper Punishment .

		And it will give me Satisfaction , if their Lordships , viewing this Matter in the same light , are pleased to indulge me with remitting the Fine .

		The four
New England	LOCATION	Governments being absolutely at War with us , it is no longer safe to attempt carrying on the Survey under the direction of Captain -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Holland	PERSON	, and apprehending that gentleman and those employed under him , with their Plans , Charts and Instruments & ca to be in great danger of being seized by the Rebels , Notwithstanding their Labours are for the general good of
Mankind	LOCATION	, I have wrote to Captain
Holland	PERSON	at
Perth Amboy	ORGANIZATION	, and directed him to put the abovementioned Articles on board the
Asia	LOCATION	for Security ; I have directed Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	to receive all the Surveyors on board the
Asia	LOCATION	if they desire it ; and , as soon as I hear from Captain
Holland	PERSON	, I shall order those borne on the Canceaux 's Books to be discharged .

		I received a Letter from Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	the 9th instant , to which I returned an Answer next day , I inclose an extract of Captain
Vandeputs Letter	PERSON	and a Copy of my Answer .

		Having been obliged to send the Kingsfisher .

		to
Virginia	LOCATION	I ordered Captain
Pryce	PERSON	on the Viper on the 13th instant to proceed over the Shoals with a Transport to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and , leaving her with Captain
Wallace	PERSON	, to go on through the Sound to
New York	LOCATION	, and put himself under the Command of Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	, He accordingly fell down to
Nantasket	LOCATION	the 13th .

		By the Viper I sent Orders to Captain
Wallace	PERSON	to put the supernumerary Marines and Seamen on board the Rose and
Glasgow	LOCATION	into the Swan , and to send that
Sloop	PERSON	with them to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I have ordered Lieutenant
Thomas Graves	PERSON	in the
Bolton Brig	ORGANIZATION	to put himself under the Command of Captain
Wallace	PERSON	, and to sail with another Transport in Company of the Viper .

		I transmit an Extract of a Letter from General
Gage	PERSON	expressing his desire for a Schooner to go to
St Augustine	LOCATION	.

		I immediately appointed the
St Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	to that Service .

		On the 14th I ordered Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	strictly to watch the Ferries from
New York	LOCATION	to the Jerseys and
Long Island	LOCATION	, and endeavour to seize any of the Delegates to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the Rebel General Officers , and most active abettors of the Rebellion of what Degree soever .

		Their Lordships may probably desire to know the general Tenor of my Orders respecting the Rebels , to the Captains of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, I therefore inclose a Copy of those given the 22d August to the Honorable Captain
Tollemache	PERSON	upon his going to
North Carolina	LOCATION	; and of the 17th of September to Captain
Collins	PERSON	of the Nautilus on his return to the
Delaware	LOCATION	; The same day I ordered Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	not only to take or destroy Rebels at Sea , but to lay waste and set fire to those Towns on the
Sea Coast	LOCATION	that shelter pyrates , or from whence any are fitted out , constantly protecting and defending his Majesty 's faithful Subjects and their property where ever they can be distinguished .

		The Wind blowing easterly prevented the Viper ,
Bolton	PERSON	, and Transports from sailing according to their Orders .

		On the 17th at Night I received a Letter from Captain
Pryce	PERSON	of his Majesty 's Sloop Viper , a Copy of which is inclosed .

		In consequence whereof I ordered the Surgeons of his Majesty 's Ships that happened to be at
Nantasket	LOCATION	to examine Captain
Pryce	PERSON	; I transmit a Copy of their Report .

		Being myself perfectly satisfied of his Unfitness to serve from great age and infirmities , I consented to his quitting the Command of the Viper , the present Juncture requiring active men capable of bearing the Fatigue of those Vessels .

		I have already acquainted you in my Letter August 17th that Lieut.
Graeme of the Preston	PERSON	was sent to put Captain
Macartney	PERSON	in Arrest , and to command the Mercury by order ; that Ship not being arrived , and the Viper detained only by contrary Winds from sailing with `` Orders of great Consequence to Captains
Wallace	PERSON	and
Vandeput	PERSON	, and that Sloop being also much wanted with the
Asia	LOCATION	at
New York	LOCATION	; I thought it would in all events be best for the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	to appoint a Commander to her , I therefore gave a
Commission	ORGANIZATION	to my Nephew Lieut.
Samuel Graves	PERSON	of the
Preston	PERSON	.

		But as I am well apprized of the irregu larity of this measure , I beg leave to observe that I should not have put in the second Lieutenant of the
Preston	PERSON	, had I not been certain of a Vacancy for the first ; the Charge against Captain
Macartney	PERSON	being of that nature not to be tried abroad with Satisfaction to all parties , nor without great Detriment to the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		I beg , Sir , you will be so good to represent to their Lordships that I do not mean by this appointment ta : establish a precedent , and that I shall strictly observe the Regulations they have been pleased to make ; but that in truth , considering this Step to be most advantageous to the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	, I have ven tured upon it ; and I shall hold myself under very great Obligations to their Lord ships , if they are pleased to confirm my Nephew 's Appointment to the Viper .

		I have appointed Mr
Edward Sneyd	PERSON	Midshipman on board the
Preston	LOCATION	to be third Lieutenant of her , and removed the former third Lieutenant to second .

		I inclose a Copy of a Letter to me from Captain
Wallace	PERSON	and of the papers referred to therein .

		I can not sufficiently express my Satisfaction with his Alertness and Zeal for the Cause of his Country against the Rebels .

		I have sent the
Bolton Brig	PERSON	to him with a few Howitzers & c , acquainting him at the same time that he must not suffer the New Londoners to carry off the Schooner and Hay with impunity .

		I flatter myself the Connecticutians will soon repent the preferring to make War against their Sovereign rather than continuing peaceable and obedient If I am erring in pursuing , as far as I can , severe measures against his Majesty 's rebellious Subjects , I hope it will appear they have not been hastily adopted ; that the losses his
Majesty 's Squadron and Army	ORGANIZATION	have already suffered , and the determination of the Rebels to destroy us at all opportunities , do fully justify the most rigorous punishment that can be inflicted ; and that I can not in conscience do otherwise consistent with my Duty to his Majesty and my Country .

		Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	desiring to be landed in any part within his Govern ment , to prorogue the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	of the Province of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, sailed the 20th instant in the Hope Schooner to the Isle of Shoals , from whence his Excellency returned to
Boston	LOCATION	this day , and Lieutenant -LSB-
George -RSB- Dawson	PERSON	brought with him two Vessels seized for coasting contrary to
Law	PERSON	.

		Ten Sail of Transports being got ready to go to
Penobscot Bay	LOCATION	to get fuel for the
Garrison	PERSON	; upon the Generals application for Convoy to them I appointed the Lively ; but one Ship not being thought sufficient the General armed the
Spy Transport	ORGANIZATION	, and a Sloop : On board the first I have put a Lieutenant , two Midshipmen and 19 Men from the
Boyne	LOCATION	, and manned .

		the Sloop out of the other Ships .

		On the 20th the Lively sailed with this Convoy ; together with the
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	, Viper ,
Bolton	PERSON	,
St Lawrence	LOCATION	and
Halifax	LOCATION	; and the Transports for
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		Finding the people of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	continue migrating to the Colonies , and the
Kings Army	ORGANIZATION	here being in want of Recruits , I directed Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	by an Order dated the 24th instant upon the arrival of any Ship or Vessel at
New York	LOCATION	with Emigrants from
Great Britain	LOCATION	or
Ireland	LOCATION	not to suffer one of them to land , but to send the Ship or Vessel round to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The
Charlotte	LOCATION	hired Sloop sailed the 24th with Dispatches to the Southward .

		I am this moment acquainted that a Frigate is coming up , I therefore close this Letter in full expectation of the most interesting Accounts from
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

Bermuda	LOCATION	, and to prolong his Cruise for the Packet to the Sixth Day of October .

Council	ORGANIZATION	on Thursday the , 14 .

		They approve your Proposition , the Way appears to them promising .

		At the same time we have advanced Money so largely for that Article , and have great Reason to expect a Supply in a similar Method , that they judge it not expedient for us to proceed farther at this Time .

		It is an Article that requires our Attention , and wish every Method that appears ー probable to obtain it may be pursued .

		I hope General
Washington	LOCATION	will hearken to your Application , and suitably encourage and promote your generous Design . ''

		... Since the sailing of the small Vessel I observe in the New Yark Paper that a Packet is arrived there from
Falmouth	LOCATION	which I take it to be the same that Capt.
Whipple	PERSON	was sent after .

		If so the Opportunity is lost ; but by extending his cruise a little longer he may have a Chance for the August packet .

		The Person sent to Gov.

		I could wish you would communicate it to the -LSB- Continental -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for which you 'll have
Time	ORGANIZATION	sufficient and I make no Doubt of their Concurrence .

		In Fact the State of our
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	here is so low that it would be impracticable to be of any Service to the Expedition , if all other Objections were obviated '' ー I have accordingly laid the Proposal before the

		ー I could not have thought after the clear & Sensible declarations made by Capt Thos .

England	LOCATION	if She was Seriously disposed to Stretch it over us that many of these who had Spoke & more who had Voted for the Measure had judged as blind Men do of Colours ー I Should rejoice to find my Self mistaken in my own judgement , but that as the history of so important an Act would be transmitted through the World & to posterity I was desirous that it Should be known -LRB- although I was not obliged to give my Vote -RRB- on which Side of the question I had been ー I was desirous also that my Children Should .

		know it & finally that however I might appear from Such declarations to be an Adversary the Committee Should find me a generous one ー I would not oppose the question of the project Since it had been Resolved upon by a Majority .

		ー but that I could not believe the people at large would be pleased with it .

Sullivan ts Island	LOCATION	ー the
Sub Commee	ORGANIZATION	had represented the impracticability of carrying the first intended measure into execution while those Ships lay there after much debate I put the question ー which was lost 33 to 16 ー down went the Remora 2 as the parson calls it , to the Channels & up went his passions & Ill breeding ー Gentlemen who were against the measure for attacking the Man of War , consented to Submit the Subject to a new Debate on Friday ー this is a kind of sporting which is not warranted by good Sense or Sound policy ー If the proposed measure was a good one , it ought not to have been opposed ー if bad ー it ought not to have the chance of a Second experiment ー this Strange versatility confirms my observations that many had judged of the Scheme as blind Men do of Colours & that we were reduced to the circumstances of Boys who had wantonly embarked in a Boat & launched into deep Water without a paddle ー if the proposition for attacking the Men of War Should be agreed to , upon a reconsideration on Friday , I very much doubt whether the Resolution will be carried into effect ー if a Serious attempt is made there will be bloody work ー the
Tamar	PERSON	is as well prepared as Such a Crazy Boat can be ー the Cherokee is fitted for defence & so is a fine Schooner which the Man of War lately Seized for that very purpose .

		I have sent you four Men who will engage to bring two or three Pieces of Cannon down the Rapids in a
Batteau	LOCATION	at Night .

		This is of great Consequence , and while you are bombarding the
Fort	LOCATION	at
St Johns	LOCATION	we may do the like at

		A small Guard might be sent to Mr

		Col.

Party of his Men & Canadians	ORGANIZATION	.


Genl Prescott	PERSON	hearing of his coming engaged a Number of People from the suburbs at a Half Joha a Man to go out agt
Allen	PERSON	.

		They met near a League from
Town	ORGANIZATION	where a smart Engagement insued , which lasted upwards of two Hours .

		They had two Field Pieces , and our Party after a long Engagement were obliged to retire , tho the Enemy by all Accounts came off second best .

		I have sent of -LSB- f -RSB- Mr
Ohara	PERSON	-LSB-
Henry O'Hara	PERSON	-RSB- Express to
Longale	LOCATION	to learn the true State of this Battle .

		The Canadians that have returned to me from the Battle agree in general that Mr
Allen	PERSON	is either dead or taken Prisoner .

		This , if true , is a Blow upon us .

		Tomorrow we propose to have a Consultation at
Longale	LOCATION	.

		Our greatest Misfortune is the Want of Ammunition Mr
Allen	PERSON	should never have attempted to attack the Town without my Knowledge , or acquainting me of his Design , as I had it in my Power to furnish him with a Number of Men .

		This Retreat of our Men may be a Hurt to us and weaken our Party .

		I have just sent down the River for a Reinforcement , and will keep them ready against the Arrival of your Cannon .

		I could wish to make a bold Push agt the Town , tho Nothing can be done without Cannon .

		I hope your Batteries are ready to play against
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	by this Time .

		If you write to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	soon , you will be kind enough to recommend me to them as your Goodness may direct you .

		When-ever my Country calls upon me to its Assistance , I shall be always ready to do my Duty .

		I could wish this Province was already united to the others , and ca n't expect much Peace till that takes Place .

		I am with greatest Esteem yours & c

NEWBURYPORT	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY TO THE MASSACHUSETTS PROVINCIAL CONGRESS The
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	for the Town of
Newbury Port	LOCATION	, beg Leave to represent , that the Harbour of this Town , is so obstructed by
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, & so blocked up by certain Piers , which have been sunk at the Mouth of it , that it is fitted for , & is already become an Assylum for many Vessells , who seek to avoid the Piratical Ships of our Enemies : Yet as there are many small armed Vessells , which are cruising along all the shores of the Province , & frequently crossing this Bay : many Vessells some loaded with Provissions , & some with Fuel & Lumber , have been taken before they coud reach the Mouth of this
Harbour	LOCATION	, & sent to
Boston	LOCATION	, this we humbly conceive might in a great Measure be prevented , & this Bay , as well as
Harbour	PERSON	, be safe from these depredations , if an Armed Vessell , was stationed in this River , which shou 'd occasionally Cruise from
Cape Ann	LOCATION	, to
Cape Elizabeth	PERSON	: many other Advantages cou 'd arise from such a Guard to this Part of the Coast ; it would be a great security to the several
Harbours	ORGANIZATION	, between the two Capes beforementioned , for by sometimes taking a Station at the Isle of Shoals , she wou 'd command most of these Harbours & prevent their being annoy 'd , by
Vessells	ORGANIZATION	belonging to the Enemy , unless they were of
superior Force	ORGANIZATION	; & we think we may add too , without Vaunting of much superior
Force	ORGANIZATION	, New large
Vessells of Force	ORGANIZATION	, can not come very near this , & some other Harbours in this Bay , without great Hazard , nor can their Stay , be of any Continuance , so that the Risque from them , wou 'd be small & doubtless many more Vessells from our Friends in the other Governments , wou 'd visit us , than now do ー some
Powder Vessells	LOCATION	, are already expected here , others wou 'd go for the same Purpose , if this Measure took Place ー large
Quantities of Lumber	ORGANIZATION	, Flour & Grain might conveniently & safely be bro ' t here , for the use of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, & perhaps they might be supplied thro ' this Course , with more Ease , safety & Convenience , & with less Expence than thro ' any other Channel The said
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, woud further represent to your Honours , that impressed with these Ideas , the Inhabitants of this Town , are ready to engage in such an Undertaking ー It is not in their Power to fit out & employ a Vessell of sufficient Force , at their own Expence , they have already greatly exerted themselves , in their own Defence , & in the common Cause , the Mercantile Part of the Town , only , will receive a
Peculiar Benefit	ORGANIZATION	, & that as their foreign
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	is cut off , in a small Proportion to the Public ー but we will be at all the Trouble attending it ; we can procure a Vessell , & Commander & Men on suitable Encouragement & there are now in the pay of the Government , two Companies stationed in the
Towns of Newbury & Newbury Port	ORGANIZATION	, out of which Companies , it is probable , a large Part of the necessary Complement wou 'd readily engage .

		ー & we can also find , if necessary eight or ten Carriage Guns , a number of Swivels , & a small
Quantity of Powder & Provissions	ORGANIZATION	ー the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, with the Leave of the Court , attend to , & Direct the Motions of such a Vessell , so that she shall neither remain inactive , nor run into needless Danger .

		ー Upon the whole , we beg leave to submit this our Proposal , to your wise Consideration , trusting that we will at least stand excused , for our good Intentions , & as in Duty bound , will ever Pray ー

DAVID GOULD	PERSON	TO THE
SOUTH CAROLINA	LOCATION	COUNCIL OF SAFETY Illustrious Patriots .

		/ If the most pressing necessity shall not be deemed a sufficient apology for the singularity of this address ; I own myself unable to make any ; and must submit to your censure .

		ー Perhaps it may be no easy task to determine why the unhappy are solicitous to conceal their infelicity ; but certain it is , that this Propensity is so powerful ; where any degree of delicacy presides in the mind : that every Person in the least acquainted with the human heart must be thoroughly convin 'd of its distress when compel 'd to proclaim it .

		ー It is of but little consequence : Gentlemen for you to be inform 'd that in the early part of my life I quit the Land of my nativity , and pass 'd a number of years in the
West Indies	LOCATION	; where the desire of independence enabled me to combat all the infirmities peculiar to that fatal Climate , till persevering diligence in the practice of medicine , had put me in possession of -LRB- what I tho ` t -RRB- a modest sufficiency for every future Care .

		ー My unambitious views being thus satisfied , and the distresses which began to threaten my native Country -LRB- to which I feel every faculty of my soul indissolubly united -LSB- -RRB- -RSB- determined me to return & share its destiny .

		ー Accordingly all my property was shiped at different times , and on different Bottoms to
North America	LOCATION	, in one of which I took Passage myself ; and after a most miserable & length -LSB- y -RSB- Voiage replete with inexpressible hazard and hardship I arrived at
Boston	LOCATION	a few days before General
Gage	PERSON	; where I received the Melancholy news , that by ship-wreck & some other accidents to which Maritime affairs .

		are liable , almost every shilling of my hard earn 'd acquisitions was utterly lost .

		ー With a heavy & almost disponding heart , I proceeded to
New Jersey	LOCATION	where I have two Children ; and after spending some time with them , resolved to try my fortune once more among the
Islands	LOCATION	; in pursuance of this resolution on the 20th of March , I took shipping at
New York	LOCATION	& Eleven days after was cast away at
Cape Hatteras	LOCATION	; from whence with much difficulty I got to
Georgia	LOCATION	; and being depriv 'd by this accident of the very inconsiderable all , sav 'd from my former misfortunes , have not had it in my Power to make a second attempt ; and Consequently have ever since been a distitute unhappy Wanderer , without a home .

		ー But the laudable preperations which are making for the preservation & defence of every sacred and valuable enjoyment , gives me leave to hope I may be yet rendered useful to society ; and not intirely thrown by in the meridian of life , as a Worthless member in the Community .

		ー I am not such a novice as to be ignorant of the obstacles which impede the success of a stranger destitute of friends , interest , and acquaintance ; and that employments are procured more easily by those who are more fortunate , but Gentlemen : let me beg you will oppose to those difficulties , the truely Pitiable situation to which I am reduc 'd ; and let this consideration excite you ; generously to Imagine what it is impossible to discribe ; the exquisite feelings of a Person of sensibility ; accoustomed to the Joys of society & the Conveniences of life ; by fatal Mischances ; at once secluded from both , Oblig 'd to exist the Child of dayly dependence , and compel 'd by the indispensable call of nature to accept the unpleasant Condition .

		ー -LRB- vile debasing necessity -RRB- , the universal benevolence of which your Characters bespeak you Possess 'd ; Join 'd with these reflections ; I flatter myself will supply the place of acquaintance , interest & friends .

		ー Permit me Gentlemen ; to inform you farther ; that in the last War I spent several years in the service of my Country -LRB- chiefly in Character ;-RRB- and during my residence in the Indies served in a similar Capacity , for the verity of this I have sufficient vouchers ; & should think myself happy in an opportunity of submitting them to the inspection of your Patriotick and honourable Board .

		ー Now Gentlemen : If on perusing this paper you shou 'd think proper in any manner to honour me with your Commands , I shall endeavour to evince my gratitude by discharging any trust reposed in me , to the best of my abilities & with the utmost integrity .

		But on the Contrary : if my suit is fruitless , and I am given over a Prey to despair ; I hope humanity & goodness of heart will induce you to Pardon this trouble & presumtion of a stranger ; and forget the author who cou 'd never have been put on this expedient but as his last resources .

		I have the honour to be with all Possible Respect : Worthy & Respectable Gentlemen -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		MINUTES OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF NOVA SCOTIA At a
Council	ORGANIZATION	holden at
Halifax	LOCATION	on the 28th of September 1775 Read the Extract of a Letter from General
Gage	PERSON	to the Governor dated the 5th of Septemr : as follows Vizt The Admiral has not so many Vessells in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	that the Rebells from this Province will not have an opportunity to land there , but to Guard against the worst some temporary Work may be thrown up & additions may be made to the Old Works on the
Citadel Hill	LOCATION	as you shall judge best & in some manner to fortify & entrench about the
Navy Yard	ORGANIZATION	.

		I think this will be better than Captain -LSB-
William	PERSON	-RSB- Spry 's proposal of Blockhouses which may be easily fired & wou 'd not be finish 'd this Season ー And the Engineer Capn .

		Spry attending and being call 'd in & having answer 'd several Questions proposed ー It was Consider 'd , That the Nature of the Ground being Rocky in most places wou 'd not admit of an intrenchment , also that the frost & rains attending the Season coming on wou 'd interrupt & prevent such Work from being compleated that therefore the only practicable fortification woud be by Temporary Blockhouses & Pallisadoes .

		And it was Resolved that the Engineer do immediately proceed to fortify the
Navy Yard	ORGANIZATION	in that manner ; which may be defended by the
People of the Town	ORGANIZATION	& afford a retreat for them .

		And in respect of fortifying the
Citadel Hill	LOCATION	it was consider 'd that the Season is now too far advanced to undertake anything , especially considering the great want of Workmen & troops for the defence of it ー And on further consideration of the most secure & effectual measure for the defence of the Town : The Governor proposed for the consideration of the Council the means `` of Collecting a force to the Number of One thousand Men to be provided with Pay & Provisions : which was unanimously Agreed to & approv 'd of & further Resolv 'd that the four
Companies of Light Infantry	ORGANIZATION	now forming at
Lunenburg	LOCATION	be Order 'd immediately for this Town , & that Mr. E -LSB- nsign -RSB- be order 'd to send these Troops to

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO JOHN HANCOCK Sir ,
Ticonderoga Sepr	PERSON	28th 1775 .

		I am this Moment honoured with your Favour of the 20th Inst .

		The honorable
Congress	ORGANIZATION	have my warmest Acknowledgments , and they may rest assured that Nothing on my Part shall be wanting to inforce that Success they so earnestly wish , and I hope soon to congratulate them on it .

		Whilst I deprecate the untimely Misfortune , which prevents me from sharing in the immediate Glory , it was perhaps inflicted in such a critical Hour to serve the Common Cause , for if I had not arrived here , even on the very Day I did , as sure as God lives , the
Army	ORGANIZATION	would have starved .

		The Letters I have been obliged to write to several officers , I have been under the Necessity of couching in Terms that I should have been ashamed of , did not Necessity apologize for me .

		In twenty two Days 538 Barr : of Provisions only had been sent across
Lake George	LOCATION	, and two Hundred and sixty Men , which take as many
Batteaus	PERSON	as would have carryed two Hundred Barrels more , and not an .

		Ounce had been sent from this Place , Except twenty Days Allowance for about 230 Men who had left this after me and before my Return here .

		In six Days since my Arrival , five Hundred and forty two Barrels have been brought over
Lake George	LOCATION	, and two Hundred Men with only the same Boats ー And have sent to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	three
Batteaus	PERSON	with Rum and Artillery stores two Hundred & eighty nine Barrels of Provisions , and 395 Men with 20 Days Provision each .

		The horrid Anxiety I suffered from this dreadful Situation of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	is now abated ; and I hope for so sufficient a Restoration as to enable me to join them .

		I do not think I shall have Occasion for
Genl Wooster	PERSON	's Regiment , as I only wait for Batteaus to send on five Hundred New Yorkers that I now have here , and which I suppose will soon embark , as the Wind is now favourable for Craft to come from
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	and which I expect with Impatience .

		The Troops from
Connecticut	LOCATION	have not been mustered ー They made Objections , which tho not satisfactory to me , I was under a Necessity of yielding to .

		I forsee a Variety of Difficulties in settling Accounts not only with them but every other Corps .

		They are however surmountable , and I believe that I have found a Plan which will answer the Purpose , and which I shall do myself the Honour to lay before
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on a future Day .

		ー Inclose your Honour a Copy of my last , which as I did not send by Express may be detained .

		That of the 19th I hope is come to Hand .

		It is Pity there is no Post between
New York & Albany	LOCATION	.

		I believe it would be no public Expence .

		A.M. September 28 , 1775 .

		Mr.
Berrien	PERSON	applied to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	with sundry letters from the commissioners at the
Highlands	LOCATION	, by which it appears they want labourers .

		Ordered , That Mr.
John Berrien	PERSON	be authorized to procure fifty able-bodied men , good labourers , at wages not exceeding 50s per month each , besides their provisions , to proceed immediately to assist in erecting the fortifications on the banks of
Hudson	LOCATION	's river , in the
Highlands	LOCATION	; that he procure as many of them who have and will take arms with them as he conveniently can ; that he order and direct at least twelve carriage guns to be mounted there immediately , and provided with shot , carriages , rammers , sponges and every other necessary for the use of the said guns .

		And Ordered , That Mr.
Gabriel W. Ludlow	PERSON	, deliver to Mr.
John Berrien	PERSON	two hundred weight of gunpowder for the use of the people at the said fortifications .


Die Jovis	PERSON	, 4 P.M. Sept. 28th , 1775 .

		A letter from
Samuel Bayard	PERSON	and others , dated 25th September , was read and filed , and is in the words following , to wit : At Constitution Fort , Monday 25th Sept. 1775 Gentlemen ー We received last night a letter from Mr. -LSB-
John -RSB- Berrien	PERSON	, informing us that the plan for building the fortification , with the estimation of the expenses , was transmitted to the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		We should have esteemed ourselves happy had we been consulted on this subject before it had been sent forward .

		It was easy for one of our body to have waited upon the Committe of Safety , to have given them full satisfaction relative to the situation of the ground , which it is not possible for them to know by the plan .

		We conceive that an operation of this kind is intended for the .

		defence of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	and for the advantage of
America	LOCATION	in general .

		If we are right in our conjecture , Mr.
-LSB- Bernard	PERSON	-RSB- Romans ' plan is not sufficient ー it will only be a temporary expedient to prevent vessels going up the river , and should the fortification fall into the hands of the ministerial troops it will prove the ruin of the Province .

		Therefore it was not possible for him to give you any calculation relative to the whole expense , as it will be absolutely necessary to extend the works ; and the place , we are convinced , may be made impregnable , and the expense not enormous .

		It appears to us that it would have been much better to have calculated the amount of what it would cost , than to be obliged hereafter to apply a second time to the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		However , we submit our ideas to your judgment .

		It is our duty to be faithful to the important charge committed to our care , as we will not be answerable for measures we can not conduct ; therefore request the favour ー of you , gentlemen , to inform us whether we are under Mr.
Roman	PERSON	's direction , or whether he is obliged to consult with us upon the measures to be pursued .

		You can not blame us for this request , as the safety , honour and interest of our country , and its future welfare , depend upon this important post .

		We think it our duty to give you a hint which seems to merit your consideration , viz : Gov.
Tryon	PERSON	, Mr.
William Bayard	PERSON	and Major
Bayard	PERSON	, 2 have been up in our neighbourhood ; his Excellency did not say any thing , but both the
Bayards	LOCATION	examined Capt.
Palmer	PERSON	, our captain , with great scrutiny , in the presence of his Excellency , about the fortification , the nature of the ground , the state it was in , how many guns were mounted and how many men watched .

		This happened on Saturday , at
Haverstraw	LOCATION	.

		We shall keep a look out , for we expect them near to us .

		Will it not be prudent that we should have a guard .

		The minute men at New-Windsor want powder ; they are ready to come to our assistance if they had it .

		ー We ought to have powder and shot for our guns as we shall mount six this week , ninepounders .

		We are , with respect , gentlemen , -LSB- & c. -RSB-

Hampton	PERSON	, agreeable to the recommendation of the Hon.

		By the brigantine

John -RSB- Barrett	PERSON	, from
St. Kitts	LOCATION	, we learn that a certain
William Priddis	PERSON	, a merchant of that island , sent last July a sloop with provisions for the ministerial troops at
Boston	LOCATION	; and , in the captain 's hearing , declared , that he would supply them with every thing that lay in his power : But , as for the Americans , they might starve and be d -- d .

		This said rascal Priddis -LRB- who by the bye , it seems has some negro blood in him -RRB- is possessed of a very large estate , which he has got solely by the American trade , and not many years ago , when at the northward , received the kindest usage , from many gentlemen of distinction .

		After rifling the passengers trunks , they went off , taking with them a middling of bacon , one pig , two hunting shirts , a tomahawk , two fowling pieces , and a silver hilted sword .

		Some time after ,
mr. Middleton	PERSON	went on board the man of war , to demand his vessel , & c. when the valiant captain , with the usual insolence of the small gentry in the navy , damn 'd him for a rebel , and said , had it not been for his wife and children , he would have sent him to

Joshua Barney	PERSON	, p. 26 -RRB- ,
Barney	PERSON	was stopped just within the
Virginia	LOCATION	capes by
H.M.S. Kingsfisher	PERSON	.

		His interception was likely by the tender which had gone a cruizing as above .


Mary Barney	PERSON	's account reads : `` He entered the
Chesapeake Bay	LOCATION	on the 1st of October , and was soon afterwards boarded by an officer from the British Sloop of war '
Kingsfisher	PERSON	, ' who , after searching his ship and taking possession of all the letters and the few arms that were found on board , gave him the exciting information that his countrymen were in a state of rebellion , and that two battles had already been fought , at
Lexington	LOCATION	, and Bunker 's
Hill	PERSON	: Barney literally ` devoured ' the intelligence ` with greedy ear , ' and was scarcely restrained by the presence of His Majesty 's loyal officers , and the gaping mouths of the ' Kingfisher , ' from making such an exhibition of his own ` rebellious ' spirit , as would in all probability have subjected him to detention , at least , if not to severe punishment ; but fortunately for him , his discretion prevailed , and he was permitted to proceed .

		He had been too fotle at home from the period of his twelfth .

		year , to hear much of the rumbling which so long preceded the great political storm now at hand ; and if the .

		idea of a revolution had ever entered his mind , it was as of some far distant future event , the glories of which might have been faintly shadowed to his youthful fancy , but never with such distinctness , even in his wildest dream of ambition , as to leave the impression of his own participation .

		But here it was , ー just beginning to develope its teeming dangers and honors , at the very moment that he himself was bursting into the first vigor of youth , and panting for opportunities , of distinction .

		Could it be true ?

		And would he indeed have a chance of drawing a sword in the service of his country ?

		ー If he could have added wings to his ship ; or fleetness to the breeze that was wafting her gently along the smooth surface of the
Chesapeake	LOCATION	, the days that intervened before he stood upon the shore of his native city would have been converted into minutes ー so eager was he to hear a confirmation of the news . ''

		The inconveniences which must unavoidably arise to the people , deprived by this step , of that access to your Excellency , which is absolutely necessary for transacting public affairs , is apparent ; and we submit to your Excellency 's consideration , whether the retirement of our Governor to a King 's ship , in this time of general disquietude , when the minds of the people are filled with the greatest apprehensions for their safety , may not increase their alarm , and excite jealousies of some premeditated design against them .

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM
BERMUDA	LOCATION	DATED SEPTR 29TH 1775 . ''

		The unhappy Disputes between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	not only affect us with the utmost regret at the Calamities of our fellow Subjects , but are likely to involve us in Distresses scarcely inferior to their 's .

		ー Our
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	, allarmed at the dreadful aspect of approaching Famine , passed a Law in May last , prohibiting the Exportation of any kind of Provisions untill all obstructions to supplies from
America	LOCATION	should be removed .

		An Application was made soon after to the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	representing our Situation , and requesting some Relaxation of their Commercial Restrictions in favor of a people incapable of injuring , or of serving them , and solely dependant on them for supplies for at least
Nine Months	ORGANIZATION	in the Year .

		In Expectation of obtaining the Indulgence we sued for , the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	was induced in the Middle of August to suspend the operation of some part of the Law , untill the tenth of September , as there was a considerable Quantity of
Rice	PERSON	in the Country the property of Non Inhabitants ー Which being less saleable than other provisions was permitted to be exported .

		But no provisions , whatsoever , the property of persons residing in the
Island	LOCATION	were permitted to be exported .

		ー On the third Instant the Inhabitants of
St Georges	ORGANIZATION	were allarmed by a Report that a Vessel that had sailed that Day had been privately loaded with provisions in express Violation of the Law of the Country , and despatched by the Governor to
Boston	LOCATION	ー The
Committee of St Georges	ORGANIZATION	, appointed by the Law to search all suspected Vessels , immediately procured a Boat and with some others went out in pursuit of her ー They got on board about eleven O : Clock at Night at the Distance of five or six Leagues from the Land ー Upon searching there were no provisions found on board as had been represented to the Committee .

		There was reason however to suspect that the Vessel was dispatched with some sinister Intent from the secret Manner in which she had been sent off , because nothing of the kind could be proved .

		she was permitted to proceed on the Voyage without any Molestation whatsoever ー The Captains name is
Lightbourne	PERSON	ー The Sloop I believe belongs to one
Sawyer	PERSON	of
Newbury	LOCATION	in
New England	LOCATION	ー He told the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	that he was bound to
New York	LOCATION	.

		ー This Transaction has been construed as a most flagrant opposition to Government , and will , no
Doubt	ORGANIZATION	, be represented in that Light , in
England	LOCATION	.

		ー 2 There wanted nothing to confirm the apparent Justice of such a Representation but an Incident which happened last _ Night and this Morning .

		The Scorpion Sloop of War commanded by the honourable Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Tollemache	PERSON	, with a Transport , arrived about a fortnight past , from
Boston	LOCATION	ー We were at a loss to know the Reason of such an unexpected Visit ; altho ' we could not help forming some Conjectures concerning the Occasion of it .

		The last Evening Intelligence was received at
Somerset Bridge	LOCATION	, that a Shallop with a party of Men from on board the Scorpion , completely armed , and under the Command of an officer had left
St Georges	ORGANIZATION	in the Afternoon ー The place of her Destination was suspected to be
Ely	PERSON	's Harbour ー * As there was reason to apprehend that they come in quest of Provisions , a party of Gentlemen immediately assembled , and sent on board a Schooner , which had just arrived from
Charlestown	LOCATION	with a Load of
Rice	PERSON	, to secure her Sails , Boom and
Rudder	PERSON	, that she might not be carried off .

		Another party repaired to
Bethell	PERSON	's
Island	LOCATION	where there was a considerable Quantity of
Rice	PERSON	, Bread & Flour in a Warehouse , in order to secure that too .

		Soon after the Shallop arrived , and the Officer waited on the Captain of the Schooner to purchase the Cargoe , which was refused ー Upon his Return several Gentlemen were deputed from the Number of those assembled on the
Island	LOCATION	, which were by that
Time	ORGANIZATION	near 100 well armed , to demand the Reason of such an hostile Appearance in a place where the utmost Tranquility had reigned before .

		The officer very politely told them he came up to purchase a Cargoe of Provisions on the Account of Government ー The Gentlemen replied that if it was intended for Exportation there was an express Law of the Country against it .

		The Officer assured them that he knew not of such a Law , and that he acted only in obedience to express Command .

		As there was no reason to apprehend that under the present Circumstances , any person would supply them , the Company for the most part dispersed ー Some few remained to observe that no Violence was offered to the Provisions on board the Schooner , or on the Island .

		In the morning the Officer with his attendants went on board the Schooner , demanded the Sails & c , and Told the Captain that he had express orders to sieze the Schooner & Provisions for the Service of Government , if he would not sell them to him .

		This he was preparing to execute when a party of Gentlemen went on board and obstinately refused to permit the vessel to be removed from her Moorings , or any of the Rice to be taken off , against the Consent of the Master .

		* The Officer then went off with his Attendants to
St Georges	ORGANIZATION	, telling the Gentlemen he would bring the whole Force of the Scorpion to carry the Point .

		He was assured that an equal Force could be raised at a Moment 's Warning to repel any lawless Invasion of the property of an Individual , or to prevent an arbitrary Violation of an express Act of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	of the Island .

		If they have not more wit in their anger than to attempt to execute their Design by Force , we may expect the Honor of another Visit this Evening or to morrow ー but we shall brave the Stings of the Scorpion whilst we act in Defence of the Liberties of
Mankind	LOCATION	, and the Laws of our Country ー The Rice is all on shore except fifty Barrels , which will be landed , before they can possibly return , and conveyed to some place of Security , unles our hourses are no more sacred than our Vessels from the Hands of arbitrary Rapine .

		Thus , you see we are not exempted from attempts at Despotic Oppression , since every petty Tyrant in Commission dares to usurp the power of infringing the most sacred Laws !

Cambridge	LOCATION	30th Sept 1775 The Manoeuvers of the Camp has afforded nothing important for a month past .

		The Works at plough 'd
Hill	PERSON	are finish 'd , but are useless , because we have not Powder to annoy the Enemy & if we had , it would be an idle Expence of it to expend it in Cannonading at such a Distance .

		The Enemy have fir 'd from their different Works 2000 Cannon Balls & 300 Bombs , without killing ten men of ours .

		When Orders were given for 1100 men under Col.
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	to march for
Quebec	LOCATION	, the men offer 'd so readily , that 5 Times the Number might have been draughted for this laborious & hazardous March , had they been wanted .

		We were in anxious Suspense , during their Passage from

		This is no very great Acquisition for Us , but will be a severe Disappointment to our ministerial beseig 'd Enemy .

		ー Notwithstanding these continual Depredations , our Assembly will not be prevail 'd to fit out Privateers .

		The Delicacy is absurd surely ... The Carphenters are all at Work here , building 20 flat bottom Boats , which are to carry 50 men , & which with 250
Whale Boats	ORGANIZATION	, which it is said are ordered here , can carry 3000 Men .

		There are 3 floating Batteries which carry 1 nine pounder & 2 six Pounders each , besides , Swivells & small Arms .

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
FRANCIS LEGGE	PERSON	Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	30th Sepr 1775 I have the Honor of your Excellency 's Letters August 27th and 28th and of the 4th & 11th instant with their Inclosures .

		I am particularly obliged to your Excellency for pointing out so clearly the Scarcity likely to happen in the Province of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	by our drawing from thence too large
Supplies of Cattle	ORGANIZATION	and other Stock .

		Many of the Inhabitants of
Boston	LOCATION	have fitted out Vessels and entreated permission to go to
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	to procure fresh Provisions ; hitherto they have not been refused , and it would have the Appearance of Cruelty to deny them , but as they have all been wanting in that respect due to your Excellency , and , under pretence of furnishing the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, have perhaps obtained Indulgences they were otherwise not intitled to , I beg leave to assure you that altho ' the Tenor of Passes hath been generally to procure fresh Stock for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, they have been granted under a Supposition that
Nova Scotia	PERSON	was benefited by the Trade , and with a View to supply our Market , and not for the particular Use of the Fleet .

		Whatever we may wish to have in future for the Fleet I will make particular Applications for to your Excellency , and I suppose the General will do the same for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	; And with respect to all those who now have my pass , your Excellency will be the best Judge how far they can be indulged , but no part is for the Fleet .

		Your Excellency may depend that a proper force shall be stationed in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	to protect the Coast and Inhabitants from any Insults or Depredations of the Rebels .

		I am & c
Sam	PERSON	l Graves 1 .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO CAPTAIN
EDWARD LE CRAS	PERSON	,
H.M.S. SOMERSET	LOCATION	,
HALIFAX	LOCATION	Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	30 Sepr 1775 I have received by the Pacquet your Letters of the 13th and 15th instant together with the Inclosures therein mentioned .

		And by the Store Ship which arrived the 29th your Letters of the 17th 18th and 21st instant and Duplicates of your Dispatches by the Pacquet .

		My time is so much taken up at present that I can not reply so fully as I wish to do , and shall therefore only speak to those points that require dispatch , until another opportunity .

		In all cases of Seizures where the Cargo or Hull can not be libelled with a tolerable Prospect of being condemned , it is best to allow the Vessel to be unladen and the
Cargo	ORGANIZATION	sold for the Owners , reserving a preference of the whole or any part for the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		In some Cases I have taken
Bond	PERSON	, but principally where known disaffected people have been proprietors ; so that your having a Bond for the Salt is as much as at present can be done .

		With respect to the Vessel , I think it best to let her remain where she is , unless the property in her is changed to more friendly people , or that you find she can not legally be prevented from navigating .

		And now I am on the subject of Captures , I must acquaint you that although Government is sending out great reinforcements to the Fleet , I have not yet received more enlarged operating powers than I was before possessed of , so that the Acts of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	must be your general Guide where a special Order from me does not direct otherwise , and also except in urgent and very flagrant Cases .

		I approve of your precautions and of the Orders given for the Security of the Yard , and desire you will cause them to be punctually observed without respect of persons .

		This is a time when the utmost precision is necessary and the most exact Discipline should be enforced .

		Too much praise can not be given to your diligence in equipping the
Somerset	LOCATION	, and the attention you have at the same time bestowed on the Kings Yard , which from your Report is indeed in bad condition , and it can never be otherwise when its Government is lodged in three persons generally unequal to the Task separately or collectively , and always invested with very abridged powers .

		I shall therefore depend on your putting every thing in the best Order possible before Winter and in seein.e : as much justice done to the King as you can .

		It is surely defeating the intention of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	of
Great Britain	LOCATION	to suffer Emigrants from
New England	LOCATION	since the Rebellion to enjoy the Priviledges of the other inhabitants of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, and their Assembly might I think have obliged all such to be residents a year or two , and to have given some proof of their Loyalty , before they should be capable of carrying on any Commerce by Sea .

		And it is also to be wished Registers were not so indiscriminately granted , but it is difficult to say how or where the line could be drawn .

		As you wish for another Ship , and perhaps
Mr O'Brien	PERSON	may go that way , I have sent you the Fowey to be hove down , repaired , new sheathed and fitted again with all possible Dispatch .

		I am glad the Savage is sailed for
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		The arrival of the Mercury obliges me to detain the Fowey a few days longer , so that -LSB- you will -RSB- receive this by the Pacquet ; and I will if possible write to you again by Captain
Montagu	PERSON	.

		A Vessel will be freighted by -LSB-

Victual	PERSON	, and will purposely throw herself in the Way of some of your Ships to be seized .

		And it will be necessary , to preserve the Master from the Resentment of his Countrymen on his Return , to put on the Appearance of compelling him to come to
Boston	LOCATION	; but it will be proper also to take out some of the People and send yours instead , as the Crew may not be depended on .

		Mr.

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	conversed with him on the subject of his being an engineer at the fortifications on the banks of
Hudson	LOCATION	's river in the

Romans	PERSON	withdrew .

		After some time spent therein , Mr.
Romans	PERSON	was called in , and the Chairman by order of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, informed Mr.
Romans	PERSON	that the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	would not contract with him for building the said fortifications ; that he should be paid for his services as an engineer ; that as the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	was sitting and the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	to meet in a few days , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	could not make any proposal of , or any answer to , establishing him as an engineer , during the unhappy controversy in
America	LOCATION	; but that if his merits in the pressent business should appear to be such as to recommend him , it would be an advantage to his reputation ; and that should the controversy unfortunately continue long , it was probable his future services might be wanted ; that the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	had been informed that twelve shillings a day sterling -LRB- and not twenty shillings sterling as he alleged , -RRB- was the value of the pay and perquisites of an engineer on the British establishment ; but that the infancy and present circumstances of the country will not admit of allowing pay equal to that given in old settled
States	LOCATION	; that the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	could not encourage him to expect more than the pay of a colonel in the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	army , and that only for the present ; but that this proposal shall not stand in the way of any better provision for him , if the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	should think proper to make any better ; and that as he stood in need of cash , he should have an order on the Treasurer of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of this Colony for some money .

		Thereupon , Ordered , That
Peter V. B. Livingston	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, Treasurer of the
Provincial Congress of this Colony	ORGANIZATION	, advance to
Bernard Romans	PERSON	as engineer at the fortifications in the
Highlands	LOCATION	, the sum of twenty pounds on account .

		A draft of a letter to the agents for erecting the fortifications in the
Highlands	LOCATION	was read and approved of , and is in the words following , to wit : In
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	, for the
Colony of New-York	ORGANIZATION	, In the recess of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, New-York , Sept. 30th , 1775 .

		Gentlemen ー We were favoured with yours of the 25th inst .

		In answer thereto we beg leave to observe that Mr.
Romans	PERSON	was brought to assist in planning and directing the fortifications by your advice and request .

		The estimate and plans he delivered to us , we sent to the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	with a letter mentioning that at least fifteen hundred pounds beyond the estimate might be necessary for incidental charges exclusive of cannon .

		Mr.
Romans	PERSON	is now to proceed to you and give you his best advice and assistance as an engineer .

		The
Congress of this Colony	ORGANIZATION	will meet next week .

		We also soon expect directions from the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and in the meantime we hope the works may be carried on with all your joint wisdom , advice and assistance .

		We his Majesty 's faithful Subjects the Mayor , Aldermen and
Common Council of the Borough of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	in
Common Hall	LOCATION	assembled , beg leave to represent to your Lordship , that on this day a Party of Men under the command of Captain -LSB-
Matthew -RSB- Squire	PERSON	of the Otter Sloop of War lying in this harbour , landed in the.most public part of this Borough in the most daring manner , and in open violation of the peace and good order , Seized on the Printing-Utensils belonging to an Inhabitant of this Town as also the Persons of two of his Family .

		We beg leave to represent to your Lordship , that this Act is both illegal and riotous , and that together with a Musquet-ball fired into the Town yesterday from on board the King
Fisher	PERSON	has greatly alarmed and incensed the Inhabitants , and has occasioned a great number of the Women and Children to abandon this Borough , and that if these arbitrary Proceedings pass unnoticed by your Lordship as Chief Magistrate of this Colony that none of the Inhabitants are Safe from insult and abuse .

		we therefore as our duty represent this Matter to your Lordship for you interposition .

		We my Lord as Men , and as a Common Hall have ever preserved the peace of this Town , and have never prevented the Ships of War and others from being supply 'd with Provisions or any other Necessaries , and have Carefully avoided offering any insult to any of His Majesty 's Servants .

		We had therefore hoped that the Inhabitants would never have been molested in their lawful business .

		We are Sorry however to have it in our power to
State	ORGANIZATION	this fact to your Lordship which we must and do think a gross violation of all that Men and Freemen can hold dear .

		Allow us to observe to your Lordship , that if the ー Inhabitants had been disposed to repel insult , that they were Sufficiently able either to have cut off or taken Prisoners the
Small Party	ORGANIZATION	that came on Shore , and this we hope is another Proof of their peaceable intentions .

		We the Mayor ,
Alderman	PERSON	and

		LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	TO THE TOWN HALL OF THE BOROUGH OF
NORFOLK	LOCATION	-LRB- Copy -RRB- To the Mayor , Aldermen and
Common Council of the Borough of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	in
Common Hall	LOCATION	assembled ー -LSB- September 30 -RSB- Gentlemen .

		I was an Eye Witness to a
Party	ORGANIZATION	belonging to the Otter Sloop of War landing at the time and place you mention , and did see them bring off two of the Printers Servants , together with his Printing Utensils , and I do realy think they could not have rendered the Borough of
Norfolk	LOCATION	or the Country adjacent to it , a more essential Service than -LSB- to -RSB- deprive them of the means of poisining the minds of the People , and exciting in them a Spirit of Rebellion and Sedition , and by that means drawing inevitable ruin and destruction on themselves and Country .

		As to the illegalety of the Act , some of you in this very Common Hall Assembled ought to blush when you make use of the expression , as you can not but be Conscious that you have by every means in your power , totally subverted the Laws and Constitution , and have been the Aiders and Abettors in throwing off all Allegiance to that Majesty 's Crown and Government to whom you profess yourselves faithfull Subjects .

		As to the
Musquet Ball	PERSON	being fired into the Town , I believe there is not a Man in it that is not Satisfied it was an accident , and such a one as I hope will not happen again .

		With regard to your having ever preserved the peace in your Town , there is very recent proof of the Contrary 2 Your not repelling the insult -LRB- as you call it -RRB- or taking prissoners the small party that was on Shore , I impute to some other reason -LRB- from your Drums beating to Arms , during the greatest part of the time which the party was on Shore -RRB- than to your peaceable intentions .

		As to your last requisition , I do assure you that every means in my power shall be employed , both with the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	and
Army	ORGANIZATION	, to preserve the peace good order and happiness of the Inhabitants of the Borough of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, so long as they behave themselves as Faithfull Subjects to His Majesty ; and I expect at the same time , that , if an individual shall behave himself as your Printer has done by aspersing the Characters of His Majesty 's Servants and others , in the most false and Scandalous manner , and being the instigator of Treason and Rebellion , and you do not take proper Steps to restrain such off enders , that you will not be surprised if the Military power interposes to prevent the tottall dissolution of all decencey , Order and good Government ; But I promise you on my Honor , that , if the Printer will put himself and Servants under my protection , that they shall not meet with the least insult , and shall be permitted to print every occurrance that happens during these unhappy disputes between the Mother Country and her Colonies , he confining himself to truth , and representing matters in a fair Candid impartial manner on both sides ; this I hope will convince you that I had nothing more in view , when I requested Captain -LSB-
Matthew -RSB- Squire	PERSON	to Seize the Tipes , than , that the unhappy deluded Publick might no longer remain in the Dark concerning the present contest , but that they should be furnished with a fair representation of facts , which I know never would happen , if the Press was to remain under the Controul of its present Dictators .

Rebellion Road	LOCATION	, September 30th .

		I have received a message , signed by you , from a set of people who style .

		themselves a
General Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		The presumption of such an address , from a body assembled by no legal authority , and whom I must consider as in actual and open rebellion against their Sovereign , can only be equalled by the outrages , which obliged me to take refuge on board the
King	ORGANIZATION	's ships in the harbour .

		It deserves no answer , nor should I have given it any , but to mark the hardiness with which you have advanced , that I could so far forget my duty to my Sovereign and my country , as to promise I would take no active part in bringing the subverters of our glorious constitution , and the real liberties of the people , to a sense of their duty .

		The unmanly acts that have already been used to prejudice me in the general opinion , may still be employed by that
Committee	ORGANIZATION	; but I never will return to
Charlestown	LOCATION	, till I can support the King 's authority , and protect his faithful and loyal subjects .

		Whenever the people of this province will put it in my power to render them essential service , I will , with pleasure , embrace the opportunity ; and think it , a very happy one .

		I am , Sir , Your most humble servant ,

General Committee	ORGANIZATION	think proper to inform you , that they have not refused a Supply of Provisions to the King 's Ships in this

		The hostile Dispositions which the Commander of those Ships has for some
Time	ORGANIZATION	past shewn towards this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, by imprisoning its Pilots , affording -LSB- Sanctuary -RSB- to a Traitor , Seizing its Seamen , dismantling its principal Fortification , stopping private Property , and firing upon the Persons of its Inhabitants who were not only peacable but unarmed , and driven from the Shore , do make it necessary , in their Opinion , to alter the Mode of Supply .

		And as you have declared , that you do not mean to leave .

		the Station , it can be no Disadvantage to His Majesty 's Ships to receive their Provisions from Day to Day in this warm Climate .

		You are pleased to assert , that we have taken the absolute Government of this Province into our Hands .

		This last was taken by some men from

Sir A Informer is such a mean despcable Caracter that I shudder to think that I Should be branded by such a Name , yet when I reflect that what I am doing is self disinterested and I only mean it to advantage of my Country , it lays easy on my Mind I think its now high time that every friend to

		The Vessel I mean is a small Schooner laying at Oranges wharf , she has a square Tuck painted Yallow a White bottom , black waisted with a Woman head , She was formerly the property of a Mr

		ー She is fitting out by Hencocks Ambassador Capt.
Dean	PERSON	and some other principal Rebels , I think they mean to

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM
NORFOLK	LOCATION	, OCTOBER 1 . ''

		Yesterday came ashore about 15 of the King 's soldiers , and marched up to the printing-office , out of which they took all the types and part of the press , and carried them on board the new ship Eilbeck , in presence , I suppose , of between two and three hundred spectators , without meeting with the least molestation ; and upon the drums beating up and down the town , there were only about 35 men to arms .

		They say they want to print a few papers themselves ; that they looked upon the press not to be free , and had a mind to publish something in vindication of their own characters .

		But as they have only part of the press , and no ink as yet , it is out of their power to do any thing in the printing business .

		They have got neither of the compositors , but I understand their is a printer on board the Otter .

		Mr.
Cumming	PERSON	the book-binder , was pressed on board , but is admitted ashore at times : He says Capt. -LSB-
Matthew -RSB- Squire	PERSON	was very angry they did not get Mr. -LSB-

Holt	PERSON	who happened to be in the house the whole time they were searching , but luckily made his escape , notwithstanding the office was guarded all round .

		Mr.

Arthur Upshaw	PERSON	, of this County , Gentleman , and a Member of this Committee , had sent out a vessel , loaded with grain , for the
West Indies	LOCATION	, since the 10th of last month , contrary to the Resolves of the
Continental Association	ORGANIZATION	; this day the said
Upshaw	PERSON	sent a letter by his son , acknowledging the notice , and confessing that his said vessel had sailed since the 10th of last month .

		And upon reading and considering the said letter , and hearing several witnesses upon oath , it appears that the said
Upshaw	PERSON	has been some months past forwarding the said vessel for the sea ; that he cleared her out the 20th of July last , for the British West-Indies , with grain , long before she was finished ; that by sickness of his workmen afterwards , and other unexpected delays , he found he could not get her ready time enough , but that he was determined , at all events , she should sail ; that after the 10th of last month , and before she did sail , sundry of the inhabitants of this County -LRB- one of them a Member of this Committee -RRB- waited on him , and cautioned him against sending out his vessel , as a step exceedingly disagreeable to the people ; that he promised that company she should not sail till the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	met , and he would wait on them .

		A day being accordingly appointed , sundry Members met , but not a sufficient number to form a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	; that the said
Upshaw	PERSON	having that day attended , according to promise , said he expected his vessel was then sailed , as he had given his master orders to sail the first fair wind .

		Resolved , unanimously , That the said
Upshaw	PERSON	, by sending out the said vessel , has violated the
Continental Association	ORGANIZATION	, and that his case be published in the
Virginia Gazette	LOCATION	, agreeable to the Resolve of the Eleventh Article of the said
Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	3 October 1775 His Majesty 's Ship Cerberus arrived the 26th of last month , and Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Symonds	PERSON	delivered to me the following Orders and Letters : Vizt Their Lordship 's Order July 24 , 1775 , to stop all Ships bound to and from
America	LOCATION	, and search them for Letters , mentioning two Ships lately sailed from the Downs suspected to carry Letters from Persons in
England	LOCATION	, who secretly hold a traiterous Correspondence with the Rebels ; Their Lordships Order August 2d to take the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	under my command ; Your Letter June 25 Duplicate , acknowledging the Receipt of my Letters by Mr
Nicholls	PERSON	and Captain Chads ; your Letter August 2d with an Extract of a Letter from his Majesty 's Envoy at
Lisbon	LOCATION	and a Copy of a Letter from Mr
Strickland	PERSON	at
Gibraltar	LOCATION	; your Letter August 3d answering in detail such of mine as required it , and inclosing a Scheme of the Naval force intended to be employed on the
Coast of North America	ORGANIZATION	; And your three Letters August 5th that Lieut. Col.
Collins	PERSON	is appointed to command the
Marines	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	; to cause six second Lieutenants of Marines to be landed from the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	and follow Major -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB- Tuppers Orders ; and inclosing their Lordships Order above mentioned relative to stopping and searching all Ships coming to or going from
America	LOCATION	.

		The Nautilus sailed the 20th of last month for the
Delaware	LOCATION	, where I hope Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Collins	PERSON	will fall in with the
Mary	PERSON	and
Elizabeth	PERSON	, and
Pensilvania Pacquet	LOCATION	; and it being a Rule to open and read all Letters , I am sure if the above Vessels are met Captain
Collins	PERSON	will narrowly examine the Letters on board them , and bring those to me that contain any matter tending to aid or abet the Rebels , or that give material information of their proceedings .

		2 I am perfectly satisfied with their Lordship 's determination about compensating the Commander and Crew of the late
Diana	PERSON	for their losses .

		The flat bottommed Boats will be of infinite Service ; and their Lordships attention in ordering out Coals for the use of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	has relieved me from great anxiety on that head .

		The intended reinforcement to the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	will I hope enable me to perform every thing that can be expected from the Fleet .

		It has been entirely out of my power to send a Ship to
South Carolina	LOCATION	; the various pressing Services to the Northward have given full employment to every Vessel I had , and knowing the Tamer 's bad Condition I ordered her to
Boston	LOCATION	, not doubting that I should soon be able to send a Ship in her room .

		I will endeavour to have Orders ready for Captain -LSB-
Christopher -RSB- Atkins	PERSON	by the
Time	ORGANIZATION	he arrives at
Charles Town	LOCATION	.

		The
Boyne	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	shall go home upon the arrival of any two of the 50 and 44 Gun Ships : I have already mentioned the
Somerset	LOCATION	being intended to remain this Winter at
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		The province of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	contains many disaffected people , Natives and
New Englanders	LOCATION	; I have reason to apprehend an attempt to destroy his Majesty 's Yard and Stores in which the Rebels from the Eastern part of
Newhampshire	LOCATION	would be sure of assistance , not only from the Town and Country people , but even from the Artificers of the Yard , who I am told are mostly of this province .

		It is indeed a very serious consideration that those employed in the King 's Yard are so intimately connected with Rebels that barely by not working they might throw us into many difficulties ; I dare not suggest what such a Set of Fanatics are further capable of .

		When Commissioner
Arbuthnot	PERSON	arrives , and I can send him a proper force for the security of the naval Yard and Stores , the
Somerset	LOCATION	shall return to
England	LOCATION	, and I hope their Lordships will approve of this Resolution .

		My Letters August 17 and 22 of last month contain every thing I can say about the quantity of provisions I now have , and my dependance for future supplies .

		With respect to Stores I will carefully observe their Lordships directions to send in my future Letters the Quantities and Species that may be necessary for the Squadron .

		The necessity being urgent for having the
Fowey	PERSON	repaired and new sheathed , I was exceeding glad of the Cerberus to take her place in
Charles Town River	LOCATION	, that she might go to
Halifax	LOCATION	; And General
Gage	PERSON	having upon my application , in consequence of their Lordships Orders , embarked some Soldiers on board a Transport to be carried to
Halifax	LOCATION	for the Security of his Majestys Naval Yard , Captain
Montagu	PERSON	takes the Transport under his Convoy ; They are already at
Nantasket	LOCATION	and will sail the moment the Wind is fair .

		The Adventure Store Ship arrived at
Halifax	LOCATION	the 27th of August , and the next day Captain
Le Cras	PERSON	began to unload her , which was done by the 6th of next month ; It took four days more to put on board again the Stores ordered to be brought here : The Lieut : of the Store Ship having charge of the whole to be delivered to the S -LSB- t -RSB- orekeeper at
Halifax	LOCATION	unavoidably occasioned some delay ; Captain
Le Cras	PERSON	was obliged to lend Mr
Hallum	PERSON	seventeen men , and with that help he at length arrived at
Boston	LOCATION	the 29th of Sepr and I had then the Honor to receive their Lordships Order May 29 to take the Adventure under my Command , their Lordships Order May 22 to send a Reinforcement of Ships and Vessels to Rear Admiral -LSB-
Robert -RSB- Duff	PERSON	upon his application ; and your Letter May 30 containing the establishment of the said
Storeship	PERSON	.

		Their Lordships having been pleased to express their approbation of my proceedings demands my most respectful Acknowledgements .

		On every occasion I shall zealously endeavour to do what appears best for the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	, and always yield a ready and punctual obedience to their Lordships Commands .

		I am & c

		The ship you mention going into

		Several Men of War Transports are gone up the sound .

		On their way they put into

Harry Bowers	PERSON	from the same place with a valuable cargo .

		The latter got ashore at
Elizabeth Island	LOCATION	and one of the Tenders came after but was so warmly received by the Company stationed there that she was obliged to make off , and our people have since carried the Brig safely off into

JAMES GRANT	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- Snt Augustine 3d Octbr 1775 ... the day before Yesterday a Man of war Schooner appeared off ー the Pilot imediately went out & was put on board , it blew fresh & she stood off & on the remainder of the day & Night .

		Yesterday she came in with the flood tide without the least difficulty , the wind being to the Eastwd you Sir very well know throws a heavy sea upon our Bar , but not withstanding she did not even touch , & Lt -LSB-
John -RSB- Graves	PERSON	who commands her told me she then drew Nine foot water ー had she been in need of assistance , there is here -LRB- belonging to Government -RRB- a Sixteen Oar 'd Launch ー a Deck 'd Schooner of about fourteen Ton , & a Stout open boat , wou 'd have been ready to have lightened her , but for Vessels of that
Burdthen	PERSON	there is no such need wanting ; she rides safe at an Anchor opposite the Chief Justices Door ー I have also a Decked Boat which is always ready , & the Pilots have my leave to command her at a moments warning for the publick use , & you may be assured she wou 'd have been out had occasion been necessary , indeed I did not dream that such assistance wou 'd be even thought off for vessells of that
Burthen	PERSON	, till I got yr Letter which makes me imagine that this barr is held to the Nd as a bug Bear ; it was formerly so , only by the Jealousy of our Two Neighbouring Collonies for fear we shoud out do them in their own produce of
Rice & Indigo	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー I hope now Men of Wars Men will have a better oppinion of it , in truth it is done great in justice to .

		ー The Govr Lt Brown of the 14th & myself not above Two Months ago sounded it with the Pilots , we had Seven foot at low Water , the tide runs five , which gives Twelve at high the
St Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	came in at three Qurs flood ー when I write to you I 'm confident you will believe me , as I mean only to say what Yr Excelly may assert ー in favor of a Province once under yr protection , & we find now you have still at heart ー the
St Lawrence	LOCATION	's log Book will proofe this .

		ー she is infinitely necessary here , for neither Provisions , Correspondance , or any thing what ever is to be obtained at this Place without such assistance 1 .

New England	LOCATION	as he should judge most proper for suppressing the rebellion now openly avowed and supported in those colonies , and to detain untill his Majts pleasure should be known all ships & vessels belonging to the inhabitants of those colonies , such only excepted as he shd find , upon good evidence & information , to be bona fide the property of persons who had in no shape been concerned in the rebellious proceedings within those colonies & had given proof of their attachment to the constitution by refusing to concur in the unwarrantable measures which had been adopted to subvert -LSB- it , -RSB- to make such a disposition of the fleet , as that , without crippling the force necessary for the service where he commanded in person , a small squadron might be stationed in

		I hope you will please to pardon my taking the liberty of laying these few lines before your excellency , but if I had not I should have thought it would have been doing a great injustice to my conscience , & I think every well meaning man who is a real friend to liberty would join in my sentiments to stop such outragious actions & rebellious works which are going to be put into execution please your Excellency I lived along with Major
John Connelly	PERSON	of
Fort Pitt	PERSON	have done this two years last July he was obliged to retire from
Fort Pitt the Inhabitants	ORGANIZATION	had a suspicion of his being an enemy to his country from thence I went with him down to
Plymouth	LOCATION	in
Virginia	LOCATION	where he got on Board his Excellency Lord
Dunmores	PERSON	ship the
Royal William	LOCATION	where we staid fourteen days & from thence he saild in his Lordships Tender the
Arundel	LOCATION	for
Boston	LOCATION	with dispatches to General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	from Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	3 there we staid ten days from thence we saild to
Newport Rhode Island	LOCATION	conveyed by the Viper sloop of War of 12 guns commanded by Capt
Thomas Greaves	PERSON	4 & from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	is to be conveyed to
New York	LOCATION	& there the Viper parts with her & she is to
Portsmouth	LOCATION	by herself .

		As I was one day with the Major in the State room just after we left
Boston	LOCATION	he asked me if I was willing to go with him into the Indian Country as he had been with General
Gage	PERSON	to get a commission & orders to go into the Indian Countrys to raise the Indians & the French & there is some part of the royal Irish I think he said at
Fort Chartres	LOCATION	& they have orders from General
Gage	PERSON	to join him & he told me they had nine twelve pounders .

		But as soon as he gets into
Virginia	LOCATION	& settles his business with his Lordship as he dares not go up the country he intends to take his Lordships Tender & to go to St Augustine & there to get guides to convey him through the
Cherokees	LOCATION	nation & from thence to the Shawneys mineoes & Delaways but he is to get Commissions from Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	for
Capt White Eyes & Cornstalk	ORGANIZATION	& other of the chiefs & to make them Presents he intends to stay at the
Detroit	LOCATION	all winter in order to get Boats & Canoes built to bring his Forces up the
Ohio	LOCATION	& the Cannon the first place he intends to fall upon is
Fort Pitt &	ORGANIZATION	to take That & then he says that he thinks that most part of that quarter will join him as he says he has orders to give them three hundred acres of land to each man that will join him .

		and another scheme he told me he was going to put into execution that is in regard to convicts & indentured servants to set them at their liberty & to give them land to join him & when he has taken
Fort Pitt	PERSON	he intends to proceed down for
Alexandria &	ORGANIZATION	there he is to be reinforced by said
Dunmore	PERSON	& some men of War & then to sweep all the Country before him .

		As your Excellency knows what state that Country is in & I thought it most fitting to disclose it to your Excellency I wrote the letter in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	to send down lest I could not have had the opportunity of getting from the vessel but I made my escape one night by great chance & a young man that was pressed on Board who is now with his parents in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	which the Major wanted to go along with him I left all my cloaths & all that I had on Board but that is nothing so I could be of any service to my country & I hope every well meaning man god will reward for so doing I hope your Excellency will excuse my Freedom but I could not be at rest till I had disclosed the matter to your Excellency .

		This letter was received by the

		The proposal was not identified by the name of the merchant ; it was dated September 27 , 1775 , and read as follows : `` About the 1st of July last I sailed from this place bound to
Martinico	LOCATION	and
Guadaloupe	LOCATION	, amongst the
French Islands	LOCATION	, provided with necessary letters and interest , with the sole intention of procuring a quantity of gunpowder and ammunition for the use of this Colony ; but on my arrival at those places , found that the whole that could be procured had been bought and shipped off in one or two vessels from this place and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		During my stay at
Martinico	LOCATION	, as I was particularly recommended to and connected with
George Mitchell	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	; the English agent , a principal merchant there , and interpreter to the Governour ; he , in confidence , informed me that several of their merchantmen that had sailed for old
France	LOCATION	, and were expected to return about the last of October or the first of November , had carried out large orders for powder , and that he expected a large quantity , the most of which would fall under his management and disposal , and proposed to supply me with any quantity ; and previously to my entering into a contract with him , he obtained permission of the Governour for my vessel to return there and trade without molestation .

		In consequence of which he engaged to deliver me five tons or upwards , on condition of my return with my vessel-load of flour , about five hundred barrels .

		I therefore request , as you are a member of the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, if you think proper to lay this matter before them , to submit the importance of it to their consideration ; and should they think proper to encourage my completing this contract , and grant me a permission to load for that purpose , you are authorized to assure them an ample security shall be given for the faithful performance of it ; that the same shall be put into execution with the greatest despatch , secrecy , and safety , being provided with the completest vessel for that purpose , and every other matter necessary to ensure success .

		If you have not made your Sales there and have Bought any Indigo for this Place or Furrs , would Advise your Selling them , if you can without Loss .

		Indigo is dull here and Furrs are wanted , but if you have gone so far in Purchasing a Cargo of said Articles , you may proceed here observing to be carefull of Avoiding a Man of War or Cutter , but if you have not taken any steps for coming this way we would Advise you to Load with Lumber and go to Hispaniola and if the Proffits on a French Cargo to Missis -LSB- si -RSB- ppi are good and tempting you may return to Orleans ー but if they are not and times are good here -LRB- which you will undoubtedly hear -RRB- Load with Mollasses or the Best Brown Sugars -LRB- or none -RRB- and to keep the Vessel by the Stern you may put in the Cabbin Coffee to be bought @ 18 -LSB- ? -RSB-

		D and proceed here and by your Arrival perhaps times may be Settled and we may get A bigger Vessel for that Trade or any other good one ー if you go back from Hispaniola to
Orleans	LOCATION	think if you can get Indigo @ 7/D and Furrs cheap it will be best to proceed Home at all events ー but if those Articles are Scarce and dear , Load once more with Lumber and go to
Hispaniola	PERSON	and from thence get the above mentioned Articles and Come home ー hope you will be so good as to keep us Informed of your Transactions and movements that we may Insure ー we shall Continue to write to you by all Oppertunities and am Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		GEORGE

JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, October 5 , 1775 I shall now beg leave to request the determination of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as to the Property and disposal of such Vessels and Cargoes as are designed for the Supply of the Enemy and may fall into our Hands .

		there has been an event of this kind at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	; as by the Indosure No. 3 , 2 in which I have directed the Cargo to be brought hither for the use of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, reserving the Settlement of any Claims of Capture to the decision of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		As there are many unfortunate Individuals also , whose property has been Confiscated by the Enemy , I would humbly suggest to the
Consideration of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the humanity of applying in part , or in the whole such Captures to the relief of those Sufferers , after Compensating the Expence of the Captors and for their Activity and Spirit .

		I am the more induced to request this determination may be speedy , as I have directed 3 Vessels to be equipped in order to cut off the Supplies , and from a Number of Vessels arriving , it may become an Object of some Importance .

		In the disposal of these Captures for the Encouragement of the Officers and Men , I have allowed them 1/3 of the Cargo , except
Military Stores	ORGANIZATION	, which , with the Vessels , are to be reserved for the Public Use .

		I hope my Plan as well as the Execution will be favoured with the approbation of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		I always dreaded his Impatience of Subordination , and it was not till after a solemn Promise made me in the Presence of several Officers that he would demean himself properly that I would permit him to attend the
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nor would I have consented then had not his Solicitations been backed by several Officers By the enclosed Return No 7 ー
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will perceive what Troops have joined the
Army	ORGANIZATION	since I left it and what Provisions & Ca .

		have been forwarded to It , ー the Canadians destroy great Quantities of Provisions , and much Waste is comitted by our People , In Despight of every Order issued to prevent It , ー the Expence of this Article will amaze
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, however if the issuing
Commissaries	ORGANIZATION	had done their Duty and Obeyed the Orders that were given them by the Commissary General or me , I should have had it in my Power to have detected every Quarter Master or Other who has drawn greater Quantities of Provision than what was due , and the Regiments might have been charged with it .

		Such Crouds of sick are daily returning from the
Army	ORGANIZATION	that altho ' I had Thoughts of leaving
General Wooster 's Corps	ORGANIZATION	at
Albany	LOCATION	, I have found it necessary to order them up , ー I wish I could comply with General
Montgomery	PERSON	's Requisition for Ammunition , But I have not an Ounce of Powder that I can Command nor do I expect any unless the
New York Congress	ORGANIZATION	can send me some to whom I wrote on the 29th Ult .

		by Express and beged they would send five Tuns if they could in Row Boats that no Delay might be made .

		The PayMaster General is now here and very much indisposed indeed , he proposed to resign the Employment , as he is apprehensive that he will not be able again to cross the Lakes .

		ー I am fully convinced that it will be the Case , but as a New Appointment during this Campaign , will be introductory of Confusion , I have requested him to return to Albany & have taken the Liberty to Give him an Order to appoint a Deputy The Pay master General 's Appointment I understand will not afford of his Paying a Deputy I mention this that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	may signify their Pleasure on the Subject .

		Should
Congress	ORGANIZATION	approve of having the Troops that are , or have been employed in this Department paid by Rolls drawn in the Form of the inclosed , It will be necessary , that I should be furnished with the Accounts of what Pay only has been advanced to them , for which Purpose an Order should go to the Governor of
Connecticut	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that of
New York	LOCATION	and that of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	to furnish me with the Accounts , specifying the Persons Names to whom Money has been advanced by their Order .

		On farther Consideration , I find this Order will be necessary even if
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should not think proper to adopt my Mode of Payment , for I labour under Difficulties in Complying with Applications for Money as I do not know but I may overrun the Mark .

		The first One hundred thousand Dollars issued to Mr -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Trumbull	PERSON	are expended , and as I shall have large Calls on me from
Canada	LOCATION	and other Quarters I beg leave to mention the Necessity there is of a fresh supply to the
Military Chest	LOCATION	in this Department .

		I am rather better than when I did Myself the Honor to write you last , having Yesterday for the first
Time	ORGANIZATION	ventured to ride out two or three hundred Yards .

		Should I receive Your Orders to engage Troops for the Winter Services , I propose to give the offers of Commissions to the Officers of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	as they stand in Rank -LRB- unless your direct otherwise -RRB- Which I hope will be agreeable I am Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB- Ph :

John Adams	PERSON	, in his Autobiography -LRB- The Works of
John Adams	PERSON	, III , 6-8 ; hereafter cited as
Adams	PERSON	,
John Adams	PERSON	-RRB- , presents an interesting account of the debate centering around the resolutions of that day , as follows : The secretary has omitted to insert the names of this committee on the journals , but as my memory has recorded them , they were Mr.
Deane	PERSON	, Mr.
Langdon	PERSON	, and myself , three members who had expressed much zeal in favor of the motion .

		As a considerable part of my time , in the course of my profession , had been spent upon the sea-coast of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, in attending the courts and lawsuits at
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	,
Barnstable	LOCATION	,
Martha	PERSON	's Vineyard , to the southward , and in the counties of
Essex	LOCATION	,
York	LOCATION	, and
Cumberland	LOCATION	to the eastward , I had conversed much with the gentlemen who conducted our cod and whale fisheries , as well as the other navigation of the country , and had heard much of the activity , enterprise , patience , perseverance , and daring intrepidity of our seamen .

		I had formed a confident opinion that , if they were once let loose upon the ocean , they would contribute greatly to the relief of our wants , as well as to the distress of the enemy .

		I became therefore at once an ardent advocate for this motion , which we carried , not without great difficulty .

		The opposition to it was very loud and vehement .

		Some of my own colleagues appeared greatly alarmed at it , and Mr.
Edward Rutledge	PERSON	never displayed so much eloquence as against it .

		He never appeared to me to discover so much information and sagacity , which convinced me that he had been instructed out-of-doors by some of the most knowing merchants and statesmen in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		It would require too much time and space to give this debate at large , if any memory could attempt it .

		Mine can not .

		It was , however , represented as the most wild , visionary , mad project that ever had been imagined .

		It was an infant , taking a mad bull by his horns ; and what was more profound and remote , it was said it would ruin the character , and corrupt the morals of all our seamen .

		It would make them selfish , piratical , mercenary , bent wholly upon plunder ; & c. & c .

		These formidable arguments and this terrible rhetoric were answered by us by the best reasons we could allege , and the great advantages of distressing the enemy , supplying ourselves , and beginning a system of maritime and naval operations , were represented in colors as glowing and animating .

		The vote was carried , the committee went out , returned very soon , and brought in the report in these words : Here
Adams	PERSON	inserted the long resolution of that day .

		3 .

		The
Massachusetts	LOCATION	armed vessels , to which the committee referred , were the schooner Diligent and sloop
Machias Liberty	ORGANIZATION	, commanded respectively by
Jeremiah O'Brien	PERSON	and
Benjamin Foster	PERSON	.


Washington	LOCATION	, as will be noted later , reported that
Massachusetts	LOCATION	had no vessels available for the enterprise since Diligent and
Machias Liberty	ORGANIZATION	were based on
Machias	LOCATION	, and only nominally under the direction of the
Massachusetts General Court	ORGANIZATION	.


JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	' NOTES OF DEBATES IN THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS -LSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RSB- Octr .

		5 .


Gadsden	LOCATION	.

		I wish we may confine ourselves to one Point .

		Let the Point be whether We shall shut up all our Ports , and be all on a footing .

		The
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	will answer their End , if We let the Custom houses be open ; in N. Y. , N. C. , the lower Counties and
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		They will divide us .

		One
Colony	ORGANIZATION	win envy another , and be jeaJous .

		Mankind act by their feelings .


Rice	PERSON	sold for # 3 ー it wont sell now for 30s .

		We have rich and poor there as in other Colonies .

		We know that the excepted Colonies dont want to take Advantage of the others .

		Zubly .

		Q. whether the Custom houses be stopped , and the Trade opened to all the World .

		The object is so great that I would not discuss it , on Horse back , riding Post haste .

		It requires the debate of a Week .

		We are lifting up a Rod ー if you dont repeal the Acts , We will open our Ports .

		Nations as well as Individuals are sometimes intoxicated .

		It is fair to give them Notice .

		If We give them Warning , they will take Warning .

		They will send Ships out .

		Whether they can stop our Trade , is the Question .


N. England	PERSON	I leave out of the Question .


N.Y.	LOCATION	is stopped by one Ship .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	says her Trade is in the Power of the fleet .

		V -LSB- irginia -RSB- and
Maryland	LOCATION	, is within the Capes of
Virginia	LOCATION	.


N. Carolina	PERSON	is accessible .

		Only one good
Harbour	LOCATION	,
Cape Fear	LOCATION	.

		In G -LSB- eorgia -RSB- We have several Harbours , but a small naval Force may oppose or destroy all the naval Force of
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		The
Navy	ORGANIZATION	can stop our Harbours and distress our Trade .

		Therefore it is impracticable , to open our Ports .

		The Q. is whether we must have Trade or not .

		We cant do without Trade .

		We must have Trade .

		It is prudent not to put Virtue to too serious a Test .

		I would use American Virtue , as sparingly as possible lest We wear it out .

		Are We sure one
Cano	PERSON	will come to trade ?

		Has any Merchant received a Letter from Abroad , that they will come .

		Very doubtfull and precarious whether any French or Spanish
Vessell	ORGANIZATION	would be cleared out to
America	LOCATION	.

		It is a Breach of the Treaty of Peace .

		The Spaniards may be too lazy to come to
America	LOCATION	.

		They may be supplied from
Sicily	LOCATION	.

		It is precarious , and dilatory ー extreamly dangerous ー and pernicious .

		I am clearly vs. any Proposition to open our Ports to all the World .

		It is not prudent to threaten .

		The People of
England	LOCATION	will take it we design to break off , to separate .

		We have Friends in Eng .

		who have taken this up , upon virtuous Principles .


Lee	PERSON	.

		I will follow Mr.
Gadsden	PERSON	and simplify the Proposition , and confine it to the Q. whether the Custom houses shall be shut ?

		If they are open , the excepted Colonies may trade , others not , which will be unequal .

		The Consequence Jealousy , Division and Ruin .

		I would have all suffer equally .

		But We should have some Offices , set up , where Bonds should be given that Supplies shall not go to our Enemies .

Philadelphia	LOCATION	5th Oct. 1775 I laid that Part of your Honors Letter relative to the proposed Voyage and your first Letter upon the same Subject before the Comee of Secresy & I am instructed to acquaint you .

		That they approve of the Plan and in Behalf of the

Fidelity	ORGANIZATION	and to give the same Commissions & Freight which they give to other Persons for the like Service which you may rely upon to be a handsome Compensation for the Service : The money shall be paid to your Order on Sight , The

PINKNEY	PERSON	'S

Williamsburg	LOCATION	-LSB- October 5 -RSB- .

		A few days ago lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, in consequence of a piece in the
Norfolk Intelligencer	ORGANIZATION	, commanded about a dozen of his men to go and seize the publisher of that paper , as also all his materials .

		The printer fortunately escaped , but they succeeded in their other attempt , and carried every article belonging to him on board the man of war .

		ー Shameful as the proceedings of these harpies were , we forbear , at present , to insert a single syllable against the people of
Norfolk	LOCATION	; time , however , will evince whether they acted in this affair becoming the character of freemen , or whether pusillanimity had not too great a share in their conduct .

		Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, we hear , has , in a taunting manner , promised the inhabitants of
Norfolk	LOCATION	that they shall sustain no great injury by the loss of their printer , as he will execute any thing in that way for them which they may please to send to him .

		But here , too , his lordship may fail , as it is reported he did in a certain other duty ; though probably , by sending for his
Minden	LOCATION	hero -LRB- his old speech writer ,
& c. & c.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- 1 he may procure some aid .

		ー Suppose , then , -LSB-
Edward -RSB- Foy	PERSON	to be his foreman , would not -LSB-
Matthew -RSB- Squire	PERSON	make an excellent printer 's devil ?

		We learn that two of the
Norfolk	LOCATION	printer 's workmen were also taken on board the man of war , but are since released .

DUNMORE	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- No 32 -RRB-
The Ship William	LOCATION	by
Norfolk Virginia	LOCATION	5th October 1775 .

		ー My Lord Since writing to your Lordship by Mr -LSB-
John -RSB- Randolph His Majesty	PERSON	's Attorney General for this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, I have been Strongly Solicited by a great Number of Gentlemen well disposed to His Majesty 's Government to Erect the
King 's Standard	ORGANIZATION	, and that they -LRB- and thousands more they are persuaded -RRB- would flock to it immediately , they allege that this is the only means by which they can be Secured from the danger , with which they are hourly threatened by the Rebels ; I could have had no difficulty of directly complying with their request , but the want of Arms and Ammunition to supply them with ; I have advised them -LRB- without giving them any particular reason -RRB- to remain as quiet as possible for a Short time , when I hope I shall be in a Situation to give them more effectual support .

		The Public prints of this little dirty Borough of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, has for some time past been wholelly employed in exciting , in the minds of all Ranks of People the Spirit of Sedition and Rebellion by the grosest missrepresentation of facts , both public and private ; that they might do no further Mischief I sent a Small party on Shore , on Saturday last -LSB- September 30 -RSB- at Noon and brought off their press Tipes , Paper , Ink , two of the Printers and all the Utensils , and am now going to have a Press for the King on board one of the Ships I have lately taken into His Majesty 's Service for the reception of the remainder of the 14th Regiment whoes arrival I look for with great impatience every hour .

		My having Seized their Press & c produced the inclosed papers No 1 & 2 .

		2 I am just now well informed that the
Ordnance	ORGANIZATION	I mentioned to your Lordship in my letter No 28 .

		that the Rebells had Seized belonging to His Majesty are now Mounting on field
Carriges	PERSON	at
Williamsburg	LOCATION	and a great number of Ball casting for them at their foundaries , and that they have just now received by Land from
Baltimore	LOCATION	in
Maryland	LOCATION	three and twenty hundred Weight of Gunpowder which they got from the
West Indies	LOCATION	; the Men of War have three tenders out now Cruising for two Schooners and a Sloop that I have intelligence of that are expected from the same quarter with powder , two of which are bound to
Baltimore	LOCATION	, the other for this Colony one of the former is Armed ; thus My Lord do I see every hour His Majesty 's Enemies puting themselves in the best posture of defence possible , without having it in my power to give them the least interruption , and I give your Lordship leave to judge if this is not to the greatest degree gauling , when certain too that a very small force well applied now .

		would not only effectually frustrate all their Schemes for the present , but soon reduce the whole of his Southern part of His Majesty 's Continent to a proper State of submission ; I do beg and.intreat your Lordship that I may not long remain an inactive Spectator of such unwarrantable proceedings .

		Mr
Collins	PERSON	of His Majesty 's Armed Schooner the
Magdalen	ORGANIZATION	before he left this place had Seized a Small Sloop which was condemned in the Court of Admiralty but the People had orders from their Committees not to purchase her , she was left here with me together with another under the same predicament , by Mr
Collins	PERSON	when he was ordered Home , I have ever since employed them as tenders Cruizing for Powder and Smugling Vessells , this Sloop in a very violent
Gail	PERSON	of Wind that happened a Short time ago was drove on Shore near
Hampton	LOCATION	a Small Village up a
Creek	LOCATION	where nothing but small Craft can go , with an Officer and Six Men or eight Men on board , who to Save themselves were obliged to take to the
Woods	PERSON	, the Officer very narrowly escaped with some of the People but several of the others were taken and thrown in to Goal , and after undergoing many examination by these Committee Men were discharged as they proved that they had been pressed some
Short	PERSON	time before , they took out of the Sloop Six of His Majesty 's Swivells a Scene -LSB- seine -RSB- & c & c and then burnt Her ; We have demanded Satisfaction of the
People at Hampton	ORGANIZATION	for the Sloop and desired that the King 's Stores might be returned , to all which they have given us a positive refusal ; their Port is now blocked up and we have taken two of their Boats and shall not permit a Vessell to pass or repass till they return the Stores & c , they have called to their assistance between two and three hundred of their Shirt men Alias Rebels .

		BRIGADIER GENERAL
RICHARD MONTGOMERY	PERSON	TO MAJOR GENERAL PHILIP
SCHUYLER Camp South Side St Johns	LOCATION	.

		Octr 6th 1775 .

		Dear General , Your Dilligence and Foresight have saved us from the Difficulties that threatned us .

		We are no longer afraid of starving .

		I wait now with Impatience for the Arrival of those Troops mentioned in your last , and which I believe from the Number of Boats on the Way will soon be here to take the advantageous Post I formerly spoke of on a Hill to the Westward .

		Since my last I have had some Proposals of an Accomodation through the Channel of the Caghnawagas from the formidable
St Luke le Corne	ORGANIZATION	and other principal Inhabitants of
Montreal	LOCATION	.

		Tomorrow is appointed for a Conference at
Lapraire	LOCATION	.

		I have sent Major -LSB-
John -RSB- Brown	PERSON	to manage it .


Macpherson	PERSON	goes with him , and Mr
Livingston	PERSON	of
Chamblee	PERSON	will attend .

		The Result of this Negotiation I hope soon to make you acquainted with .

		Mr
St Luke	PERSON	's Character gives me all the Reason in the World to be on my Guard against him .

		I shall insist on some substantial Proof of his Sincerity .

		Mr
Livingston	PERSON	some Days ago took
Post	ORGANIZATION	at Mr -LSB-
Moses -RSB- Hazen	PERSON	's
House	ORGANIZATION	with near 250 Canadians .

		They are erecting a Battery there which seems to make the Garrison very uneasy .

		Yesterday they attacked them with their Row Galley but were beaten back without Loss on the Side of the Canadians .

		No certain Intelligence yet of
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's Arrival , tho there are flying Reports to that Purpose .

		I wish he was at
Quebec	LOCATION	with all my Heart , I believe there is Nothing to oppose him .

		I am extremely happy that you have sent for more Powder .

		I believe we have not more than two Tons & a Half .

		This I am afraid will not do .

		Send as many Men as you possibly can furnish with Provisions .

		I am greatly in Want of them .

		Our Feebleness has intimidated the Canadians from embarking in so uncertain an Adventure .

		Were I strong enough to send 500 Men to
Montreal	LOCATION	, it would certainly declare for us , at least I have great Reason to think .

		The miserable Weather we have had , has distressed us much , but I hope it is now over .

		Let the hard Cash come up as soon as possible , that our Reputation may hold good .

		Mr
Carleton	PERSON	is not departed , as I informed you .

		We want both
Iron & Steel	ORGANIZATION	, &
Turners Tools	ORGANIZATION	.

		The large Mortar is ready to play .

		I am & c
Richard Montgomery	PERSON	.

		I shall send some more Boats in a few Days .

		COLONEL
SAMUEL MOTT	PERSON	TO
JONATHAN	PERSON	TRUMBULL Sir Camp Before St Johns October 6th 1775 Ever since the Seventeenth of Last month we have Laid Siege to this Place , tis a very Difficult Place to Come at , as it is almost Surrounded with Sunken Swamps & Marshy ground , Many Small Occurrences have Happen 'd During the Siege which I Can not recapitulate , the Enemy it is Thought have fired 600 Bomshels besides numbers of Cannon Shot & Showers of Grape shot , but we have Lost but about a Dozn men by them all ー They Played very severely on us when we were Erecting our Battery 's I was for three Days Successively where the Shot & Shells Came & the grape Shot ratled round me Like hail , But a Good God has Preserv 'd me ー I had Several times the Dirt Spatterd all over me by the Shells & shot but None have hitherto hit me , the Extreme rainy Season & our very wet and Muddy Camp makes it much unhealthy , some Days ago I was orderd to Go round & Reconnoitre on the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	part of the fort , where we are Going to Erect a Gun Battery in order to make a Breach & storm the place If it Can be Conquerd no other way -LRB- which I Look upon the Attempt Dangerous & The Event Dubious -RRB- In going to Reconnotre I Crawld upwithin Musket Shot of the Enemy 's Batterys & observ 'd their Movements ; in Doing of which I was Oblig 'd more than once to be knee Deep in water & it being rainy I Was wet from head to foot from Early in the Morning till ten o'Clock at Night by which I got a great Cold & have not been well Since , I have been Laid Up for Several Days from business only that I keep about , but find it too Hard for my Constitution , Colo -LSB-
Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	has been very Servicable in bringing In the Cannadians & Indians , But being Encouraged by some others , he Has rather Contrary to his own Judgment Cross 'd the
River	LOCATION	about five
Miles	PERSON	below
Montreal	LOCATION	with only about 30 ,
New Englan	LOCATION	'd men & 70 Cannadian Friends 100 in the whole & Intended to Augment his Number of Cannadians & if Possible get Possession of
Montreal	LOCATION	, But he was the Next Morning Met by
St Luke Lucorn	PERSON	with about 400 Regulars & french Tories ー They Over Power 'd
Allen	PERSON	, & he is Either kill 'd or Taken with About 20 of His men -LRB- which was a Severe stroke to us -RRB- he however made some havock he Stood his ground firing till they Surrounded him altho his men forsook him , The Town Major of
Montreal	LOCATION	with some other of the most potent Tories were kill 'd in the Engagement .

		ー On the 3rd Instant , There was a Severe Engagement Between the french whigs On one Side & the french Tories & Regulars on the Other side , at
Chamble	LOCATION	about 13 miles from this place , The
Tory Party	ORGANIZATION	had the Advantage as they fired about
Fifty Cannon	ORGANIZATION	shot on our Whigs when they had only small arms to Defend With They Lost Several men on Each side , The Whigs maintaind their ground ; In Short tis a
Melancholly Prospect	ORGANIZATION	to see ; that all
Cannada	PERSON	is in one Continued Scene of War & Bloodshed , if we Dont Carry our Point we have brought
Cannada	PERSON	into the Most Deplorable Situation Possibie to Conceive , as those people Who have Taken arms in our favour with their
Wifes & Children	ORGANIZATION	will be Left to Cruelty without Mercy ; & any of our army will hardly Escape with Safety Tis amazing to me that the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	's should have so Little Sense of the Importance of This Expedition as not to give us a good
Large Army	ORGANIZATION	, well Furnish 'd in Due Season , which Indeed would have nearly Setled the Controversy , but we have never yet been 2000 Strong Exclusive of our friends of
Cannada	PERSON	, altho ' we Assume to ourselves all the Airs of a potent
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		on the 4th Instant the Enemy hauld off an Armed Vessel to the East side , when with her and a Large Schooner & the Cannon Of The fort , They began a heavy Cannonading & Bombarding on our Camp And Batterys But principally Aim 'd at a Party of about 200 or 250 of our Cannadian friends who are Intrenching themselves on the
East Side	LOCATION	on which Our Gundaloes & Battery 's Returnd the fire & the Cannadians Pour 'd in a fire Of Musquetry , on the Enemy , & a party from our Camp Commanded by Colo -LSB-
Timothy -RSB- Bedel	PERSON	, Likewise Came up & fired upon them , which made the Enemy Retire To their Den , the firing of Cannon & Musquetry was warm for about half An hour , our Cannadian friends Maintain 'd their ground & kill 'd some of The Enemy with the Loss of only one man Slightly wounded with a grapeshot I have been present with the General at a
Congress & Treaty	ORGANIZATION	with the
Indians	ORGANIZATION	where the Heads of all the Seven Nations of
Cannada	PERSON	were present & matters Were Conducted with Great Solemnity & to the Mutual Satisfaction of all Yesterday
St Luke Lucorn	PERSON	-LRB- that
Arch Devil Incarnate	ORGANIZATION	who has Butcher 'd hundreds men women & Children of our Colony , in the Late war in the Most Inhuman Manner -RRB- who has Ever been a head & Leader of the Cannadians and All the Indians , now finding that Notwithstanding all his Wiles & falsehoods The Indians & More than half the Cannadians are become friendly to Us , He has now sent a Message to us Desiring a Conference with us , the General has agreed to a Conference to be held at LePraire tomorrow Major
Brown	PERSON	& the
Aide Camp	LOCATION	on our Side , & that wretch
St Luke	PERSON	with the Principal Leaders of the Tory faction of
Montreal	LOCATION	on the other side , Tis a very Delicate Embassy & the Consequences will better manifest the Event , than it Can Be Guess 'd , ー The Indians of all the Tribes & the Cannadians who Joyn Us have all Learn 'd English Enough to say Liberty , & Bostonian , and All Call themselves
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	's , the Indians Boast much of it , & will smite On their Breasts Saying , ` me yankee , ' ー It is very Grievous to me that General
Schuyler	PERSON	is not here I had a very Good understanding with Him & a Good agreement in all the Modes of Prosecuting the Expedition but to my Sorrow & the Embarrassment Of the Service there is not that good understanding as I Could wish now General Montgomrys Chief Confident is one Colo -LSB-

		I have no Great Opinion of
Montgomry	PERSON	's Generalship altho I believe him To be a Man of Courage that is but a small -LRB- tho ' Essensial -RRB- Qualification of a General , for all the Pretensions of
New York	LOCATION	there has not been One Head Colo of a Regiment , seen in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	this year , & out of Their 3500 Men we have never had more than 600 Down here , until within this 4 Days there has Come between 2 & 300 more , I Recollect nothing more Material , The firing goes on now pretty Briskly the Enemy are very Strongly fortified , The Event of Each Day Can only be told or even Guess 'd at the Close of it , I am Sir with all Defference & Respect -LSB- & c. -RSB-

HENRY MOWAT	PERSON	, H.M. ARMED VESSEL CANCEAUX Whereas the four
New England	LOCATION	Governments are in open an avowed Rebellion against his Majesty , and they have been daring enough to make Seizures of several of his Majesty 's Ships and Vessels , and to send the Crews to Prison , and have also have fired upon killed and wounded many of the Kings Subjects serving on board his Majesty 's Ships ; And whereas there is undoubted Intelligence of their fortifying their Sea Ports , and of their determination to cut off and destroy his Majesty 's Subjects serving in his Fleet and
Army	ORGANIZATION	whenever it is in their Power .

		And whereas I have caused the
Symmetry Transport	ORGANIZATION	and
Spitfire Sloop	ORGANIZATION	to be armed and fitted in the best manner the Situation of our Affairs would admit in order to proceed along the Coast , and lay waste burn and destroy such Seaport Towns as are accessible to his Majesty 's Ships ; And whereas from your having been employed many years on the Survey of the Coast to the Eastward of this
Harbour	LOCATION	, you can not but be qualified to carry on this Service from your knowledge of all the
Harbours	ORGANIZATION	, Bays , Creeks , Shoals , and having full confidence in your integrity , Loyalty and Naval Experience , and in particular for your late spirited and judicious Conduct at
Falmouth	LOCATION	, I have thought proper that you should command on this Expedition : You are therefore hereby required and directed to take the Symmetry and
Spitfire	ORGANIZATION	under your Command together with his Majesty 's
Schooner Halifax	ORGANIZATION	, and proceed with them as soon as possible to
Cape Anne Harbour	LOCATION	, that
Town	ORGANIZATION	having fired in the month of August last upon his Majesty 's Sloop Falcon , wounded her People and taken many Prisoners ; you are to burn destroy and lay waste the said
Town	ORGANIZATION	together with all Vessels and Craft in the
Harbour	LOCATION	that can not with Ease be brought away .

		Having performed this Service you are to take the advantage of Wind and Weather , or any other favorable Circumstances , to fall upon and destroy any other Towns or places within the Limits aforesaid , and all Vessels or Craft to seize and destroy .

Nova Scotia	LOCATION	.

		You are to go to all or to as many of the above named Places as you can , and make the most vigorous Efforts to bum the Towns , and destroy the Shipping in the Harbours .

		And as the Number of Marines you carry in the Vessels are too few to land and maintain any Post , you are to be careful not to risque their Lives or the Lives of any of your People by attempting where there is not great probability of Success , but to content yourself with falling upon the Rebels , doing what you can with Expedition and coming away before they can assemble to cut off your Retreat , and never risque your Ships aground or where you can not put to
Sea	PERSON	at all times of Tide , Wind permitting .

		You are to bestow your whole attention to annoying the Rebels and the Security of your own Vessels ; to observe in all your operations the strictest discipline , not to suffer plundering upon any Account , as I will make an Example of whoever shall presume to be guilty of it .

		Whenever you can distinguish the persons or property of those who have taken no part in the rebellion and have given proofs of their Attachment to the Constituti -LSB- on -RSB- by refusing to concur in the unwarrantable measures that have been adopted to subvert it , you are to protect and defend them to the utmost of your power .

Fox Islands	LOCATION	with his Majesty 's Ship under my Command and all the Convoy on the 27th Sepr at 7 P.M. the Wind S b E .

		It blew strong that Night and all the next day ; the day following Captain
Payne	PERSON	had a Conference with the People on shore , at first they appeared little inclined to let us have their Wood ; but on our assuring them they should be satisfied for whatever we had from them , they soon grew more flexible , and we got off about 20 Cord , the rest that they had cut not being drawn out of the Woods ; nor dare they hawl it out for fear of being destroyed by Col.
-LSB- James -RSB- Cargill	PERSON	and his Ruffians from the Main ; without we ordered them so to do , which Order we soon gave , and they promised to act accordingly ; and the next day I anchored here -LRB-
Long Island	LOCATION	-RRB- with the Ships , where I found the People under the same Terror , but on our giving them every Assurance of our intention to pay for the Wood we had from them , with positive Directions to hawl their Wood to the Shore , they complied ; and we have now two Ships loaded ; two more will be finished Tomorrow and by Tuesday hope to finish three more , and by the end of the next Week we have a Prospect of getting them all loaded if not disturbed by a Visit from
Cargill	ORGANIZATION	who we are told intends us that favor .

		As we have given these People the strongest Assurances that they shall be paid for their Wood before we leave them ; and Capt.
Payne	PERSON	not being provided with Cash or Goods sufficient for that purpose , I am at his request induced to send the Sloop -LRB- that brings this -RRB- to
Boston	LOCATION	with his Letters to General
-LSB- James -RSB- Robertson	PERSON	, to forward to him by an armed Vessel and a Transport without loss of time money and goods to satisfy these People , and should the same not arrive by the time the Ships are loaded I shall be under the necessity of leaving the Spy here 'till the same arrives ; These People are very poor and in great want of almost all the necessaries of life , and I must think it will be of the greatest Consequence to the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- so far as relates to a Supply of Wood for the Garrison at
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- that the utmost Dispatch should be made in sending the money or articles Captain
Payne	PERSON	has wrote for .

		Last Night I was informed an Embarkation , on board which were 1500 Men under the Command of Col.

PORTSMOUTH COMMITTEE	ORGANIZATION	TO THE
NEW HAMPSHIRE	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY Gentlemen : ー Committee Hall -LSB- Portsmouth -RSB- October 7 , 1775 .

		On the 2d day of this month , the Ship Prince
George	PERSON	, of which
Richard Emmes	PERSON	is master put into this harbour from
Bristol	LOCATION	, bound to
Boston	LOCATION	, loaded with one thousand eight hundred and ninety-two barrels of flour .

		Upon notice of her arrival Lieutenant
Thomas Pickering	PERSON	with a boat and hands , by order of Captain
Titus Salter	PERSON	, went on board , and finding the said provisions were intended for the use of
Gage	PERSON	's
Army	ORGANIZATION	, he took her into possession , and brought her up to this Town , and unbent the sails , and applied to this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, on the 3d day of this month .

		Messrs.
S. Sherburne	PERSON	,
P. Long	PERSON	and
G. Wentworth	PERSON	; all of this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, were appointed to unload her ; and as the Town is in great want of flour , they were desired to make sale of fifty barrels for cash , and to supply the fort therewith ; but before they had accomplished it , the vote was reconsidered , and ordered that no part of the cargo should be taken out till the advice of the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	for the Province was taken thereupon .

		And we wrote at the same time to General
Washington	LOCATION	, advising him of the capture ; to which we have received the inclosed answer , by which he requests the whole may be sent up to him , as the
Army	ORGANIZATION	is in want of it , and he will be accountable for it .

		We also represent to you , that this Town is destitute of flour ; that not a barrel is to be bought , at any rate , for the supply of the forts and inhabitants ; and at best six hundred barrels should be reserved for their use , and to be sold for the cash only .

		Your advice is requested by us in respect to the disposal of this cargo , and we would wish it as speedily as possible , for our government .

		You will perceive , by
General Washington	ORGANIZATION	's letter that an armament is fitting out at
Boston	LOCATION	, upon some expedition , and , as he suspects , to bombard some Towns on the Coast ; we are not without great suspicion that the enemy have an intention upon this Town .

		With the advice of Captain
Worthen	PERSON	, we have thought proper to order Captain
Robert Parker	PERSON	to enlist forty-four men immediately , to be stationed at the fort on
Seavy 's Island	LOCATION	, for the present defence of that fort for one month ; which we hope will meet with your approbation , as we have been induced thereto wholly for the publick safety .

		We have appointed
John Penhallow	PERSON	,
John Wendal	PERSON	and
George King	PERSON	,
Esqs	PERSON	.

Congress	ORGANIZATION	resumed the consideration of the Resolution submitted by the Delegates of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, 2 and Upon motion , Resolved , That the consideration of it be deferred till Monday 16 Inst The committee appointed to take into consideration the letter from the Convention of
New York	LOCATION	, respecting the fortifications ordered to be erected on
Hudson 's River	LOCATION	, brought in their report , which being read , was agreed to , as follows : That the provincial Convention of
New York	LOCATION	be directed immediately to render
Hudson	PERSON	's river defensible ; That in doing this they may be particularly attentive to form such works as may be finished before the winter sets in .

		That it is very doubtful whether any stone work can be properly made at this advanced season , it is therefore submitted to the judgment of the convention , whether it could not be more cheaply and expeditiously done by works of wood or fassines .

		If they should think otherwise , that they be directed to go on with the work in the way which they think best , since it is the opinion of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that the work should by no means be neglected .

		But if the work be already begun on the plan sent us , that they render such parts as can be first finished defensible , so that the labour be not thrown away , if an attack should be made before the whole can be finished .

		That the convention be directed to enquire whether there are not some other places where small batteries might be erected , so as to annoy the enemy on their passage , particularly , a few heavy cannon at or near
Moore	LOCATION	's house , and at a point on the west shore , a little above
Verplank	PERSON	's point .

		That it be recommended to the said convention , to establish , at proper distances , posts to be ready to give intelligence to the country , in case of any invasion , or by signals to give alarms in case of danger , and that they confer with the Assembly of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and Convention of
New Jersey	LOCATION	on the speediest manner of conveying intelligence in such cases , and receiving assistance when necessary .

		That the convention be farther directed to take the most effectual method to obstruct the navigation of the said river , if , upon examination , they find it practicable .

		3 On motion made , Resolved , That orders be sent to General
Wooster	PERSON	, in case he has no orders to the contrary from General
Schuyler	PERSON	, that he immediately return to the batteries erecting in the highlands , and there leave as many of his troops , as the conductors of the works shall think will be necessary for compleating them , and that he repair with the remainder to

John Adams	PERSON	, in his notes of debates in the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, provides a lively account of the discussion upon the
Rhode Island	LOCATION	resolution , when its consideration was begun on October 7 , as follows : Chase .

		It is the maddest Idea in the World , to think of building an
American Fleet	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its Latitude is wonderful .

		we should mortgage the whole Continent .

		Reoollect the Intelligence on your Table ー defend
N. York	PERSON	ー fortify upon
Hudsons River	LOCATION	.

		We should provide for gaining Intelligence ー two swift sailing vessells .


Hopkins	PERSON	.

		No Objection to putting off the Instructions from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, provided it is to a future day .


Paine	PERSON	.

		Seconds
Chace	PERSON	's Motion , that it be put off to a future day Sine die .


Chace	PERSON	.

		The Gentleman from
Maryland	LOCATION	never made such a Motion .

		I never use the Copulative .

		The Gentleman is very sarcastic , and thinks himself very sensible .

		Zubly .

		If the Plans of some gentlemen are to take Place , an
American Fleet	ORGANIZATION	must be a Part of it ー extravagant as it is .


Deane	PERSON	.

		I wish it may be seriously debated .

		I dont think it romantic , at all .


J. Rutledge	PERSON	.

		Move that some Gent .

		be appointed to prepare a Plan and Estimate of an
American Fleet	ORGANIZATION	.

		Zubly seconds the Motion .


Gadsden	LOCATION	.

		I am against the Extensiveness of the
Rhode Island Plan	LOCATION	, but it is absolutely necessary that some Plan of Defence by Sea should be adopted .


J. Rutledge	PERSON	.

		I shall not form a conclusive opinion till I hear the Arguments .

		I want to know how many Ships are to be built and what they will cost .


S. Adams	PERSON	.

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	cant make an Estimate untill they know how many Ships are to be built .

		Zubly .


Rhode Island	LOCATION	has taken the lead .

		I move that the Delegates of R. I. prepare a Plan , give us their opinion .


J. Adams	PERSON	.

		The Motion is entirely out of order .

		The Subject is put off for a Week , and now a Motion is to appoint a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to consider the whole subject .

		Zubly ,
Rutledge	PERSON	,
Paine	PERSON	,
Gadsden	LOCATION	, lightly skirmishing .


Deane	PERSON	.

		It is like the Man that was appointed to tell the Dream and the Interpretation of it .

		The Expence is to be estimated , without knowing what Fleet there shall be , or whether any att all .


Gadsden	LOCATION	.

		The design is to throw it into Ridicule .

		It should be considered out of Respect to the
Colony of R. Island	ORGANIZATION	who desired it .

		Determined against the appointment of a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	TO
JAMES WARREN	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, Octr .

		7th , 1775 If We must have Trade how shall We obtain it ?

		Our Country furnishes a vast abundance of materials for Commerce .


Foreign Nations	ORGANIZATION	have great Deamnds for them .

		If We should publish an Invitation to any one Nation or more , or to all Nations , to send their ships here and let our Merchants inform theirs that We have Harbours where the Vessells can lie in Safety , I conjecture that many private foreign Adventurers would find Ways to send Cargoes here thro all the Risques without Convoys .

		At the Same Time our own Merchants would venture out with their Vessells and Cargoes , especially in Winter , and would run thro many Dangers , and in both these Ways together , I should hope We might be supplied with Necessaries .

		All this however Supposes that We fortify and defend our own Harbours and Rivers .

		We may begin to do this .

		We may build Row Gallies , flatt bottomed Boats , floating Batteries , Whale Boats ,
Vesseaux de Frize	PERSON	, nay , Ships of War , how many , and how large I ca n't say .

		To talk of coping Suddenly with
G.B.	PERSON	at sea would be Quixotism indeed , but the only Question with me is , can We defend our Harbours and Rivers ?

		If We can We can trade .

PURDIE	PERSON	'S
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	GAZETTE , SUPPLEMENT , FRIDAY , OCTOBER 6 , 1775
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, October 7 .

		1 Last week a vessel from the
West Indies	LOCATION	, with a cargo of rum , sugar , & c. consigned to capt.
Phripp	PERSON	of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, was seized by the ministerial pirates , and sent to
Boston	LOCATION	, for the use of their brethren in wickedness there ; who now begin to stand in need of artificial spirits , to support their drooping courage .

		And on saturday -LSB- September 30 -RSB- between 2 and 3 o'clock after noon , an officer with 12 or 13 soldiers , and a few sailors , landed at the county wharw -LSB- sic wharf -RSB- in
Norfolk	LOCATION	, under cover of the men of war -LRB- who made every appearance of firing on the town , should the party be molested -RRB- and marched up the main street to mr. -LSB-
John Hunter	PERSON	-RSB-
Holt	PERSON	's printing-office , from whence , without the smallest opposition or resistance -LRB- although there were some hundred spectators -RRB- they deliberately carried off the types , and sundry other printing implements , with two of the workmen , and after getting to the water side with their booty gave three huzzas , in which they were joined by a crowd of negroes .

		A few spirited gentlemen in
Norfolk	LOCATION	, justly incensed at so flagrant a breach of good order and the constitution , and highly resenting the conduct of lord
Dunmore	PERSON	and the navy gentry -LRB- who have now commenced downright pirates and banditti -RRB- ordered the drum to be beat to arrris , but were joined by few or none ; so that it appears
Norfolk	LOCATION	is at present a very insecure place for the life or property of any individual , and is consequently deserted daily , by numbers of the inhabitants with their effects .

		We hear that lord
Dunmore	PERSON	is exceedingly off ended with the
Virginia	LOCATION	printers , for presuming to furnish the publick with a faithful relation of occurrences , and now and then making a few strictures upn his lordship 's own conduct , as well as that of some of his delightful associates , such as
Dicky Squire	PERSON	and little white-headed
Montague	LOCATION	.

		Some of their actions have certainly deserved the severest reprehension , to say no worse ; for which the printers appeal to the whole world , even
Fredy North	PERSON	himself , and the immaculate
John Bute	PERSON	.

		ー It seems his lordship has it much at heart to destroy every channel of publick intelligence that is inimical to his designs upon the liberties of this country , alledging that they have poisoned the minds of the people , or , in other words , laid open to them the tyrannical designs of a weak and wicked ministry , which have been supported , in character , by most of their slavish dependents .

		It is to be hoped , however , that neither his lordship , nor any other person -LRB- however dignified -RRB- will have it in his power to succeed in so diabolical a scheme , only fit to be accomplished among Turks , and never could have been devised but by a person of the most unfriendly principles to the liberties of mankind .

		We hear that a Press is soon to be set up on board the ship which lord
Dunmore	PERSON	lately seized from mess .


Eilbeck	PERSON	,
Ross	PERSON	, & co. under his lordship 's own immediate inspection , with proper assistants ; so that we may soon expect to see the
Gosport Chronicle	ORGANIZATION	, published by authority , which it is said is to contain occasionally , the commentaries of a certain illustrious chief 's wars in
Vandalia	LOCATION	, some curious anecdotes , diverting stories , and a number of other valuable and interesting particulars , which no doubt will ensure to this new publication a very extensive circuit , and consequently redound to the credit and interest of its noble proprietor .

		The following extract of a letter from

		Various reports have been in circulation here , within a few days past , of a manoeuvre of the soldiery on the 30th ult .

		and from the communication by water being obstructed , it is seldom we get intelligence from thence , but we are assured the letter contains an authentic account .

JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	TO
SAMUEL JOHNSTON	PERSON	Sir , Cruizer Sloop of War in
Cape Fear River	LOCATION	, October 7th 1775 .

		Notwithstanding the respect I have entertained for your private character , notwithstanding my repugnance to oppose to its merits your conduct in public and political transactions , during the present unnatural , unhappy and much to be lamented contest between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her Colonies , which my long forbearance towards you must have evinced , you have reduced me to the necessity I wished to have avoided of choosing between the two disagreeable alternatives of testifying my disapprobation of your Conduct Officially , or taking upon myself the guilt of conniving at the undutifull behaviour of one of The King 's Servants , which last being utterly inconsistent with my ideas of the duty I owe His Majesty , I can not hesitate to make my election of the former however painfull my respect for Mr
Johnston	PERSON	makes that decision .

		I have seen with astonishment Your late appearance in the conspicuous character of Moderator of a popular Assembly unknown to the laws and constitution of this Province and summoned and convened by yourself .

		and I have seen with greater surprise if possible your acceptance of the appointment of Treasurer of the
Northern District	LOCATION	of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, unconstitutionally , and contrary to all law and usage conferred upon you by this body of your own creation , on whose other acts so derogatory to the just authority of The King and so utterly subversive of the constitution of this Country I shall not here enlarge , although I do most sincerely and unceasingly deplore them .

		Your conduct in these instances Sir I am bound to consider such manifestations of your undutifulness to His Majesty and His Government , and such an avowal of your participation in the present fatal disorders of this Country as render it altogether unfit , and inconsistent with my duty to The King to permit you to continue Deputy Naval Officer of this Province : and I am to inform you that I have accordingly appointed Mr
Archibald Neilson	PERSON	to supersede you as Deputy Naval Officer of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, from which Office you are hereby suspended until His Majestys Royal Pleasure shall be known .

		Mr.

St Georges	ORGANIZATION	that afternoon and was designed for Elis Harbour Where the -LSB- y -RSB- errived Some Time after Night 3 ー The Circumstance of her coming at so unseasonable an Hour & in a hostile Manner generally alarmed the people & induced them to think that some improper Design was had against the Persons or Property of the People , particularly as Reports had circulated for many Days before that the Scorpion came to Ber -LSB- mud -RSB- a for the express Purpose of impressing Men from these Ilds ー The People generally armed and prepared to oppose any illegal & arbitrary Attack and for no other Purpose whatever ー In Order to reduce the Matter to a Certainty himself with Mr
Jennings	PERSON	and Mr.
G. Tucker	PERSON	were desired by the People to call on the Officers who were said to have the
Direction of the Shallop &	ORGANIZATION	desire to be acquainted with the Purport of their coming at that unseasonable Hour & in a hostile Manner in appearance to Disturb the Peace of the People ー That the officers expressed a Concern at the People havg taken the Alarm at the Manner of their coming in which they must own gave some Foundation for such Alarm , that they shou 'd have been glad to have been applied to imedeately on their landing when they shou 'd readily have given every Satisfaction in their Power to have composed the minds of the People that they then declaved that they came with no Design of molesting any of the Inhabitants but for the sole Purpose of endeavouring to purchase the Cargo of the Schooner from So Car -LSB- olin -RSB- a comanded by
Capt Conyers	PERSON	, that they had been at Capt
Conyer	PERSON	's
Ild	ORGANIZATION	for that Purpose but cou 'd not see him as he was from Home .

		ー They were then told that if any Person here had Power to Dispose of the Cargo it was one Mr Cole who was Passenger on bd the Schooner & the Place where he was to be met with ー The Officers said they shou 'd call on Mr Cole in the Morning for that Purpose ー that the People were then satisfied with the Declarations of the Officers & imediately dispersed ー that the Officers behaved with great Civility & Politeness & were thoroughly treated in the Same Manner themselves ー The above Information was confirmed by Messrs.
John Jennings	PERSON	&
Daniel Tucker	PERSON	.

		Capt.
Clement Conyers	PERSON	Senior part owner of the Schooner from
Carolina	LOCATION	next informed the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	that on the morning of Fryday the 29th Ultimo , the Officers and Sailors from on board the Scorpion came on board his Schooner and asked for Mr.
Cole	PERSON	who coming on board immediately the Officers applied to him to purchase his Cargoe of
Rice	PERSON	.

		Who replied that he could not sell it ー as it belonged to persons in
St Christophers	ORGANIZATION	who for aught he knew might be starving for want of it .

		The officer then said if he could not purchase it -LSB- illegible -RSB- he was commissioned by the Governor to take the Vessel and Cargo and carry them to Town ー He then asked if there was any Owner of the Vessel , and was informed that himself -LRB- viz This Informant -RRB- was part owner thereof .

		The Officer then said he must take the Vessel to Town ー This Informant replied that she should not be removed without his having good Security for her .

		ー This Informant then came off and met Mr R : T : with some others going on board the Vessel & knows nothing further of the Transaction .

		Mr Cole of
Carolina	LOCATION	a passenger onboard Capt Conyers 's Schooner was next called upon who gave the following Information ー Viz : That on Fryday the 29th Ultimo the officer from
Scorpion	ORGANIZATION	came on board the Schooner and demanded of him if he would dispose of the Cargoe on board the Schooner ー He replied that he could not do it as it belonged to persons in
St Christophers	ORGANIZATION	who might be starving for want of it for aught he knew .

		ー The officer said he would pay him his own price for the Rice in Bills or Cash .

		Upon his refusing to dispose of the Cargoe the officer said he would seize it & carry it to Town by
Force	ORGANIZATION	; and then ordered the Hatches to be shut and demanded the Sails ー He also desired that the Rice which had been unladed should be put on board again .

		This Informant represented to them that Vessel being very leaky was unfit to go to Town with the
Rice	PERSON	and desired that they would permit him to continue to unload .

		Soon After Mr
Robert Tucker	PERSON	& Mr
Daniel Hinson	PERSON	with Mr
Josiah Young	PERSON	came on board , and asked what was the Matter .

		This Informant told them the Gentleman -LRB- Officers -RRB- came on board to prevent his unloading the Vessel & wanted to carry her with her Cargoe to Town ー The Gentlemen from on shore replied that it should not be done as it was contrary to the Law of the Island ; for if they wanted Provisions to carry off the Island the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	must be consulted , or words to that Effect .

		Some other Conversation of no Consequence past soon after which The Officers went off saying they would bring the whole Force of the Scorpion to take the Rice .

		Capt Clement Conyers Junr being next called upon in substance confirmed the Information of Mr Cole .

		With this addition that when the Officer ordered the Hatches to be shut he asked him whether he had taken the Charge of the Vessel on himself as in that Case she was in his power , ー but represented that her being carryed out of the Harbour might be attended with bad Effects ー The officer replied he wanted to have her Out ー The Officer then told him he should have two Men on board to prevent any more
Rice	PERSON	being Taken off .

		Which he replied he did not think he had any right to do , as he had made a legal Report and had a permit to land his Cargoe from the Ca : Ho : -LSB- Castle Harbor -RSB- .

		Mr
Samuel Gutesbury	PERSON	next called upon confirmed in substance The Information of Capt :
Clement Conyers Junior	PERSON	with whom he came off the Schooner ー With this addition That the Officer when he said he must seize the
Vessel & Cargoe	ORGANIZATION	; said That he should do it by order of the Governor for the Service of Government .

Daniel Hinson	PERSON	& Mr
Josiah Young	PERSON	to accompany him .

		Upon coming on board he saw the Officers walking on the Quarter Deck talking with each other ー Upon seeing only two or three Casks of
Rice	PERSON	landed he conceived that Capt
Conyers	PERSON	had met with some Obstruction in doing it .

		He then asked the Reason of his not unloading as he understood he intended to take his Cargoe out .

		Capt.
Conyers	PERSON	replied that the Officers had ordered the Hatches to be laid & barred and the Tackles to be hooked up ー He then replied that this was quite contrary to their Declaration of the Night before , That they had no Intention of offering any Molestation to any person in any respect whatever ー That he looked upon it as unwarrantable & quite contrary to
Law of the Country	PERSON	and that he would -LRB- if in Capt
Conyer	PERSON	's place -RRB- order The Hatches to be unlaid & the Cargoe to be taken out .

		Lieut : Drew 4 immediately interfered whereupon this Informant asked him his
Authority	ORGANIZATION	.

		He replied he had orders to buy the Cargoe , and if he could not buy it to seize it , and had seized it for Government .

		This Informant then asked him whether the Vessel was not legally entered .

		He replied ー Yes ー This Informant then insisted that it was illegal to obstruct the landing of the Cargoe after such Entry ー Mr
Whitworth	PERSON	5 then asked why the Governmt .

		had not a right to seize Provisions when-ever they wanted it ー This Informant then replied that those Provisions were detained by the Authority of an Act of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	of the Island .

		ー Lieut Drew still insisted that they had a Right to it & that they would carry the Vessel and Cargoe to Town .

		He answered that he should not have it for that the Inhabitants would never consent for The Rice to be taken away illegally .

		He then informed Lieut. Drew of the Occasion of making the Provision Act by which no Provisions could be exported without the Consent of the Legislative Body for that Purpose ー That no person in the
Island	LOCATION	would refuse Provisions for the Ship 's Use but that Agreeably to the Provision Act under the
Authority	ORGANIZATION	of which he then acted they could not export any Provisions whatever except salt Provisions ー Lieut.-Drew then said they wanted the
Rice	PERSON	and they must have it ー to which This Informant answered they should not without the Consent of the People ー and upon seeing Mr
Daniel Hinson	PERSON	going off the Vessel he called to him to make Haste and bring Assistance which he thought it his Duty to call for to prevent the
Rice	PERSON	being carried away .

		Mr
Whitworth	PERSON	expressed himself sensible of the politeness he had been treated with the Evening before & went off Soon after without any Interruption 6 telling Mr Cole They might open their Hatches & go to work and observing that he hoped the people would think better of it , or else the Scorpion would make use of all her Force to obtain the Provisions .

		To which this Informant replied that without the Consent of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	two or three Scorpions would not do .

		Mr
Josiah Young	PERSON	in Substance confirmed the Information of Mr
Tucker	PERSON	.

		A Letter to Capt Tollemache was voted ー read and approved by a Majority .

		ー An address to the Govr to convene the general
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	was also read and approved of .

		Resolved ー that it be an Instruction to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	appointed to join a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	from
Somerset Parish	ORGANIZATION	to answer the Letter from the Honourable Capt Tollemache , that they declare the strictest Allegiance to his Majesty 's Government , and set forth that his Majestys subjects of these
Islands	LOCATION	have on all Occasions demeaned themselves as loyal faithful and liege Subjects of his present most gracious Majesty and his Predecessors , and that they have ever paid all due obedience to the Laws of the British Empire ー That as Subjects thereof they are entitled to all the Rights Privileges and Immunitites which are claimed under the British Constitution .

		That the Right of personal Security and of personal Property are the inherent indefeasable Rights of every Englishman , which can not be infringed without a manifest Violation of the first Principles of the Constitution .

		That the Inhabitants of these
Islands	LOCATION	being fully represented in the general Assembly are bound by all Laws enacted by the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	of this Island , which are not repugnant to the Laws of the Realm of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in as full and ample Manner as the subjects of his Majesty residing in Gr : Br : are by the Acts of the
British Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー That any attempt to invalidate or contravene the Authority of any Act of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	of these Islands by any person or persons whatsoever within the Jurisdiction of the same , tends to stir up Seditions and Tumults among his Majesty 's liege Subjects , and is pregnant of the most calamitous Events to the Community .

		ー That it is the Duty of all Magistrates and Officers within these Islands to exert themselves to prevent any Violation of the Acts of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	thereof , and that it is the indispensable Duty of every Individual within the same to obey such orders & Directions as the said Magistrates & Officers shall give in order to preserve the Laws of this Country sacred and inviolate ー That an Attempt made on Fryday last by certain Officers and other persons under their Command belonging to his Majestys Sloop Scorpion commanded by the honorable Capt Tollemache to seize a Cargoe of
Rice	PERSON	against the Consent of the person Intrusted with the Management and Disposal thereof , without any legal Authority whatsoever , was totally repugnant to the Rights of personal Property , and that the said Attempt being probably made with an Intention of exporting Provisions contrary to an Express Act of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	of this Island is a most flagrant Violation of the Rights of the people & of the legislative Body of these
Islands	LOCATION	, That it was therefore -LRB- as well as in Obedience to a Vote of the Governor Council & Assembly of these expressly passed for the preservation of the Act for the preventing the Exportation of Provisions -RRB- the bounden & indispensable Duty of all Magistrates and officers and other Inhabitants of these Islands to oppose the Execution of any Attempt by which the Security of the Lives and Properties of the good People of
Bermuda	LOCATION	may be endangered .

		That they also set forth that this Island being utterly dependant on
North America	LOCATION	for all Manner of Provisions , and the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	having included it in the Number of those Places to which they will not permit any Exports , self preservation directs us to retain all those .

		Provisions we have in the Island at present as we have no Prospect of a future supply ; but that having the utmost Confidence in the Wisdom & Prudence of our Representatives we will readily acquiesce in Their Determination but that we canont untill the Resolutions of that respectable Body shall be known submit to be stript of our Provisions on which in all Probability our very Existence might depend at the Discretion of any private person in open Violation of the Laws .

		Resolved ー That it be also an Instruction to the said
Committee	ORGANIZATION	that an Address be presented to his Excy the Governor requesting him that no further Adjournment of the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	be made , but that if it be thought convenient that an earlier Day than that which is at present fixed for their sitting be appointed .

		Resolved , That it be an Instruction to the Representatives of this Parish that at the next sitting of the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	they shall move for an humble dutiful and loyal Address to the Kings most excellent Majesty setting forth the calamitous Situation to which his Subjects in this Island are likely to be reduced by the present unhappy Disputes between the Mother Country and her Colonies , whereby the good people of this Island are threatened with the most dreadful Approaches of famine .

		That they also be instructed to set forth therein the Conduct of the good People of this Island in such a Light as to obviate any misrepresentations which have or might be made to his Majesty with respect thereto ー And therefore imploring his Majesty 's most gracious & favourable Interposition in behalf of his distressed Subjects , that Measures may be adopted for their Relief as to his royal -LSB- Excellency -RSB- shall seem proper .

		To his
Excy George James Bruere	PERSON	& c. The humble Address of the Inhabitants of the Parishes of
Somerset	LOCATION	and Portrayal ー May it please your Excellency We his Majesty 's most dutiful and loyal Subjects the Inhabitants of the Parishes of
Somerset	LOCATION	and Portrayal being allarmed at the present unhappy Situation of this Island occasiond by some unfortunate Misunderstandings & Disputes between Capt Tollemache Commander of his Majestys Sloop Scorpion & the Inhabitants of these Parishes beg leave to entreat your Excellency That the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- if it should not be Convenient for them to be sooner convened -RRB- may not be adjourned to a more distant period than that at present appointed for this sitting In order that such Measures may be adopted by them as they in their Wisdom shall think proper for the Reestablishment of the Peace & Security of the good people of this Island ー And if your Excy should not think proper to convene them before that Day that you will be pleased to give such orders & Directions as may in the Interim serve to promote those very desirable Objects .

		INTELLIGENCE FROM CAPTAIN

Francis Grant Gordon	PERSON	of His Majesty 's Ship Argo Vizt 7h October 1775 During the time I stopped in
St Pierres Bay	LOCATION	,
Martinique	LOCATION	, to take up the
Pomonas	LOCATION	anchors and Cables Information was given me ; that a Sloop belonging to Englishmen was then taking in Powder and other
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	, the Lieutenant went to examine her , and found an Englishman , who he supposed to be the Master , and four other Englishmen weighing the anchor , on his entrance a boat was sent for the Master but no one knew his name , they all seemed confused , and being asked for
Pen	PERSON	and Ink to take the Sloops Name , the Man supposed to be the Master , said the Vessel was called the
Betsey	PERSON	, that he came Mate of her from
America	LOCATION	, but that a new Master was appointed , whose Name he did not know , but believed it was something like
Francois	PERSON	, he could not tell where she belonged to or where bound when a Frenchman came on board , said he was the Master , and flew into a violent passion for the Sloop being boarded , as he said she was a French Vessel -LRB- tho ' no Insult was offered to any on board -RRB- and produced a Receipt in English , for a Vessel called the
William	PERSON	and
James	PERSON	of an old Date but refused shewing any other Papers relating to the Sloop , on which a Mate and two Men were left on board , with Orders not to meddle with any thing til the Lieutenant returned , who was sent to take the Men out of the Sloop and wait on the Govrenor of
Port St Piere	LOCATION	on the Island of
Martinique	LOCATION	to acquaint him with the particular circumstances that had happened and desire his permission to seize the Sloop , as she was taking in Powder and Arms for the Rebels in
America	LOCATION	, but the Governor refused hearing the Lieutenant , and said he would sell the Americans Powder , Arms , or any thing else they wanted , under the nose of any Englishman of War and desired the Argo would leave the Port immediately , and if any Englishman of War ever dared to board any Ship in that Port whether English or not , he would order the Forts to fire at , and sink them if possible .

		VICE ADMIRAL

MARTINIQUE Portland	LOCATION	, English Harbour
Antigua	LOCATION	7h October 1775 -LRB- Copy -RRB- Sir By His Brittannick Majesty 's Ship Argo , which arrived here this day from
Martinique	LOCATION	, where I had sent her , for the
Pomona	LOCATION	's Anchors and Cables ; left behind in the late Gale of Wind I am sorry to receive the information she brings me , that a most pernicious Trade is now carried on from thence ; in order to supply Gunpowder and
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	, to the Rebellious Subjects of the King my Master , in
America	LOCATION	: By American Vessels , having a French Master put on board them ; hoping by that means to secure them from being seized : however should any of our Ships of War meet the said Vessels at Sea your Excellency must know the nominal French Master can not answer that purpose ; as by the Law of nations , all such Commodities are contraband when carrying to nations at War , by any neutral power : and surely there is much greater reason they should be deemed so , when intended to supply the Rebellious Subjects of a friend an Ally .

		I do not directly approve of Captain -LSB-
Francis Grant	PERSON	-RSB- Gordons searching any of the Vessels in His most Christian Majestys Port of
Martinique	LOCATION	; but on his receiving such information as he did : Zeal for his Masters Service , might hurry a good Officer to do , what on cooler thoughts he would not : to the same cause I therefore attribute the impolite answer the Commandant at
Martinique	LOCATION	sent to Captain
Gordon	PERSON	on his representing the Case to him and asking his permission to seize the Vessel .

		I beg your Excellency will believe I shall always make it my Study to keep up and Cultivate , the good harmony and Friendship , that I hope still subsists between our respective Nations and I have no doubt , your Excellency entertains the same friendly sentiments towards the accomplishment of which I flatter myself you will immediately put a stop to a trade so very pernicious and disgraceful .

		Should any of his
Britannick Majesty 's Ships	ORGANIZATION	under my
Command	ORGANIZATION	chance to meet at
Sea	LOCATION	any of the above described American Vessels -LRB- having Powder and
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	on board -RRB- they have my Express orders , forthwith to seize them ; notwithstanding a French Nominal Master , may be on board the said Vessel , and call her his property .

		16th Whereas it has been represented by Lord

Isle au Noix	LOCATION	300 Barrels of Pork and 328 Barrels of Flour , so that I think You may venture to send more Men than Provisions ー The Season advances fast & we shall have a heavy Piece of Work to get our Cannon to the Westward , where we must have a strong Post , as it is at a Distance from Support & near the Enemy .

		ー Our Conference with
St Luke	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- la

		The Enemy are exceedingly uneasy at the
Post	ORGANIZATION	on the
East Side &	LOCATION	have made two ineffectual & indeed feeble Efforts to dislodge the Canadians .

		ー The Battery there is not finished , they do n't love work .

		ー I have been obliged to send them Assistance .

		The very high Prices which Officers must pay here for every Thing brought from
Tionderoga	LOCATION	, are far above what their Scanty Pittance of Pay will allow of ー I must request You will represent the peculiar Hardship of their Situation , which displaces them entirely from the Footing of the Troops , employed among their Friends in the Midst of a Plentiful Country ー if their Pay ca n't be augmented a Gratuity may be made to them adequate to the Difficulties they labour under .

		It might extend to Subalterns and Captains ー perhaps it may not be so absolutely necessary to go any higher up ー & Indeed the Detachment in the Country & on the
North Side	LOCATION	live very well & by what I can find , Cheap .

Watertown	LOCATION	, Oct. 9 , 1775 My attention is directed to the fitting out of privateers , which I hope will make them swarm here .

		Is it not time to encourage individuals to exert themselves this way ?

		General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	before the commencement of hostilities destroyed or confiscated the provisions then collecting for the army , and can we hesitate at this time about the propriety of confiscating vessels employed by him to infest the coasts , or supply his troops , or can we doubt the propriety of encouraging individuals by giving them the advantage resulting from their reprisals , when it is certain that other plans will not meet with such success as will probably attend this ?

		If the continent should fit out a heavy ship or two , and increase them as circumstances shall admit , the colonies large privateers , and individuals small ones , surely we may soon expect to see the coast clear of cutters .

Macartney	PERSON	under an Arrest in consequence of a Complaint against him by Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	Governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	, of which Complaint I acquainted you in my Letter August 17th and transmitted Copies of Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	's accusation , of my Answer , and of Captain
George Montagu	PERSON	's Answer upon my requiring him to inform me of such Facts relative to Captain
Macartney	PERSON	's misconduct as had come to his knowledge .

		I now inclose a Copy of another Letter to me from Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, two from Captain
Macartney	PERSON	and my Answers ; these contain the whole of this Business that I am acquainted with : It is at present impossible for his Lordship to come here to prosecute his Charge .

		The accusation is so controvertible that if a Court Martial was ordered to sit , in all likelihood from want of evidence no satisfactory Judgement could be given , and above all the Service at this Juncture not admitting of long trials , I have granted Captain
Macartney	PERSON	's request to send him to
England	LOCATION	, there to be disposed of as their Lordships may think best .

		My Letter to Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	on receiving his Lordship 's accusation against Captain
Macartney	PERSON	fully shewed the opinion I entertained of that Gentleman 's abilities as an Officer ; farther in justice to him I desire to represent that the Account of Proceedings on his passage to
Virginia	LOCATION	, transmitted to me before he knew of his suspension , met my entire approbation .

		I shall continue Lieutenant Grame acting by my order in the Mercury , and not discharge Captain
Macartney	PERSON	until I am honoured with their Lordships Commands .

		His Majesty 's
Sloop Raven	PERSON	arrived the 4th inst after a long and tedious passage from
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	; By Captain -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB- Stanhope I received their Lordships Orders and your Letters agreeable to the inclosed List .

		Finding that forbearing to punish the people of the four
New England	LOCATION	Governments , for their many rebellious and pyratical Acts , only encouraged them to go greater lengths , I determined to observe a different Conduct , and if possible destroy some of their Towns and Shipping .

		To this end I sent General
Gage	PERSON	a Letter dated Sepr 1st a Copy of which and of his Answer is inclosed : many difficulties occurred in the procuring and equipping the
Symmetry Transport	ORGANIZATION	and
Spitfire Sloop	ORGANIZATION	with proper Stores for the Expedition , and , the weak State of the Garrison hardly allowing any Draughts to be made , General
Gage	PERSON	could spare but One hundred Men ; commanded by Captain Lieut.
Forster	PERSON	of Marines with a subaltern Officer .

		Canceaux armed Ship Hallifax armed Schr Symmetry armed Transpt Spitfire armed Sloop The Command of the whole consisting of the Vessels as pr Margin I have given to Lieut.
-LSB- Henry -RSB- Mowat	PERSON	of the Canceaux armed Ship , solely from his being well acquainted with the
Pilotage	ORGANIZATION	; of the Coast , where his operations are to be carried on .

		I have ordered him to take the
Advantage of Wind	ORGANIZATION	and Weather and enter any of the Harbours to the
Eastward of Boston	ORGANIZATION	; and if possible first to go to
Cape Anne	LOCATION	where the Rebels thought proper to fire upon the Falcon and where they took several of her Officers and Crew , and sent them prisoners in the Country ; Lieut. Mowats Orders are to burn and lay waste the Towns and destroy the Shipping in Harbours when they can not with Ease be taken away .

		This flying
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	lay ready to depart when the Raven arrived .

		Their Lordships Orders by her coinciding exactly with what was then doing gave me great pleasure ; The few little advantages the Rebels have had over us have given them confidence , and there is no doubt of his Majesty 's Ships being fired upon and opposed in every place where the Rebels can do it with impunity or with a Shadow of success .

		I have ordered Mr
Mowat	PERSON	to protect the person and property of his Majesty 's loyal Subjects wherever they can be distinguished ; And he sailed Yesterday the 8th instant from
Nantasket	LOCATION	.

		On the 5th instant the Nautilus returned with three Brigs , two of them Captain
Collins	PERSON	had taken , 3 and according to his Orders carried them to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, from whence Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	sent them to
Boston	LOCATION	; I inclose a Copy of Captain
Wallace	PERSON	's Letter .

		The Fowey sailed Yesterday for
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		The Nautilus is to cruize a few days in the
Bay	LOCATION	, where a
Rebel Schooner	ORGANIZATION	last Saturday chaced and fired four Shot at one of the Transports coming in from
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		General
Gage	PERSON	being ordered to
England	LOCATION	takes his passage in the
Pallas Transport	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have appointed the Mercury to convoy his Excellency over
St George 's Bank	ORGANIZATION	and I expect he will sail Tomorrow .

		I have ordered the Raven to lie in
Nantasket	LOCATION	, and the
Scarborough	PERSON	to come up to be caulked , which she is in great Want of .

NEWPORT MERCURY	LOCATION	, MONDAY , OCTOBER 9 , 1775
Newport	LOCATION	, October 9 .

		By the motions of some of the men of war and transports , in this harbour , last Monday -LSB- October 2 -RSB- , it was suspected they intended to take off live stock from the farms on the south part of this island , called
Brenton	PERSON	's Neck , the ensuing night ; whereupon a number of persons went down in the evening and brought off about 1000 sheep and between 40 and 50 head of horned cattle from several farms : But there still remained a considerable number of cattle , sheap and hogs , on two farms belonging to
Jahleel	PERSON	and
Benjamin Brenton	PERSON	, great part of which 't is supposed were by them there collected for and sold to the men of war , to be sent to
Boston	LOCATION	, for the express purpose of supplying our inveterate enemies .

		ー The next day the ships took off , from said
Brentons	PERSON	farms , about 25 head of cattle and 150 sheep ; on Wednesday they took 5 or 6 more cattle .

		There being still left on the farms of
James	PERSON	,
Jahleel	PERSON	and
Benjamin Brenton	PERSON	, between 60 and 70 head of cattle .

		On Wednesday , and Thursday morning , about 300 Minute-men arrived here from the county of
Providence	LOCATION	,
Tiverton	LOCATION	and
Little Compton	ORGANIZATION	, under the command of the Cols .


Eseck Hopkins	PERSON	and
William Richmond	PERSON	,
Esqrs	PERSON	; and as soon as they had refreshed themselves , they marched into the Neck , and brought off 66 horned cattle , some sheep , hogs , and poultry , the ships the same time lying within gun shot , and discharged several cannon at them , but without any effect .

		This town having been threatened to be fired on from the men of war , on account of the armed force which made its appearance here , a great many of the inhabitants moved part of all their effects out ; and many families have left the town .

		The carts , chaises , riding chairs , and trucks , were so numerous that the streets and roads were almost blocked up with them .

		Thursday and Friday being rainy and muddy , the poor women and children were much exposed in looking out for some place of safety ; the people continued moving out very fast all Saturday and yesterday with their effects .

		It is almost impossible to conceive what infamous rascally tricks have been made use of , to distress this town , by the abandoned set of ministerial tool here .

		The ships in this harbour , last week seized several vessels , loaded with wood , from
Long-Island	LOCATION	; which vessels , we are well assured , had Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	's permission to fetch wood for the supply of his town !

		Saturday afternoon the ships
Rose	PERSON	,
Glasgow	LOCATION	and Swan , a brig with 6 guns , and 1 or 2 small kind of bomb mortars , 3 or 4 tenders , 2 transports , and several wood-vessels , & c. making in all 15 sail , weighed anchor and went up the river , entered the harbour at
Bristol	LOCATION	, and demanded three hundred sheep , which not being complied with between 8 and 9 o'clock they began a he -LSB- a -RSB- vy fi -LSB- r -RSB- e on s -LSB- a -RSB- id town , and continued it upwards of an hour ; -LSB- in -RSB- which time , a number of shot went through the houses of
William Bradford	PERSON	, Esq ; Capt.
Ingraham	PERSON	, damaged the church a little , and several shops , stables , & c .

		The women and children , in great distress , -LRB- dark and rainy as it was -RRB- were obliged to leave their habitations , and seek shelter in the adjacent country .

		Between 9 and 10 o'clock , a committee was appointed to go on board , who settled the matter by giving or selling 40 sheep .

		In the small defenceless town of
Bristol	LOCATION	, were near 100 persons very sick , and dead , at the time of this firing , and are assured two sick people actually died of the night .

		We hear the men of war have cut up a quantity of corn at
Poposquash	LOCATION	or
Hog Island	LOCATION	.

		Early on Thursday morning sailed , the Viper sloop of war , wind
N. E.	PERSON	supposed to be gone to
New York	LOCATION	.

		COUNT DE NOZIÈRES TO VICE ADMIRAL JAMES YOUNG Copy / .

		Pointe à
Pitre Guadalupe	PERSON	9th October 1775 Sir M. de Choiseul Commandant at
Martinque	LOCATION	in my absence has just given me an account of the improper and throughtless behavior engaged in by Mr.
Grant Gordon	PERSON	commanding the English frigate Argo at anchor in
St. Pierre	LOCATION	road .

		This conduct compels me to make a formal protest and it places me in the position of requesting your Excellency for an explanation in order to know whether that Officer has been authorized to examine several ships anchored under the Cannon of the road , among them one flying the French Flag which he has caused to be lowered in order to substitute that of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		This violent act can not have your approval , and I hope that Your Excellency will give Orders to the Officers commanding men of war , that in the future they will conduct themselves in such manner as to give no offense to the good understanding which ought to be maintained between our two nations , and that he will let me know his intentions in this regard , in order that I can give an account to my Court , I am unable to conceal from Your Excellency , that a repetition of this nature will compel me to close our Ports to English men of war , and to repel with force those who would undertake any enterprise contrary to the law and the honor of the Nation .

		The event of Mr.
Grant Gordon	PERSON	's irregular conduct occasioned a disturbance among the populace of
St. Pierre	LOCATION	, which without the presence of
M. de Choiseul	PERSON	could have been difficult for the Officers , and for the English Sailors who found themselves ashore : It is of the utmost importance not to tolerate similar imprudences , and I flatter myself that Your Excellency will feel , like me , the extreme importance of it , and that he will cooperate with me toward the most secure means to continue the union and friendship which has reigned until now between the respective governments of these Colonies I have the honor to be with the greatest esteem and the highest consideration , Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB- Electe de Noziere S.

		A small Ship of War came in to our Harbour off the Watch-House Point and Fired on a Schooner which was armed by this Country .

		2 We of this town carried down to the Point two Field Pieces and fired several shot at the Man of War , which obliged her as soon as the tide permitted to go off .

		No man killed on either side as we know of .

		An account of this incident gathered from eye-witnesses is in
Edwin M. Stone	PERSON	's History of
Beverly	LOCATION	, Civil and Ecclesiastical from its Settlement in 1630 to 1842 -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	, 1843 -RRB- , 64-66 , and reads as follows : One morning in the autumn of 1775 , a privateer schooner sailed from
Beverly	LOCATION	on a cruise .

		She had not been out long , when she was discovered by the British ship of war
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	, of twenty guns , who immediately bore down upon her .

		The superior force of the enemy induced the captain to put back .

		The chase was continued until he gained the harbor and grounded on the flats .

		It being ebb-tide , the Nautilus came to anchor outside the bar , and opened a fire on the town .

		The meetinghouse being the most conspicuous object , several shots were aimed at it , one of which penetrated the chaise-house of
Thomas Stephens	PERSON	, destroying his chaise , and another struck the chimney of a house on the opposite side of the street , scattering its fragments in every direction .

		This unceremonious assault proved too much for the equanimity of its patriotic occupant .

		He seized his musket , and rushing to the beach , returned the compliment with hearty good will .

		Immediately upon the commencement of firing , many females residing in exposed situations , hastily retired to places of greater security .

		There were some , however , who , `` made of sterner stuff , '' paid little attention to this demonstration of hostility , and continued their domestic occupations as though nothing uncommon was going on .

		Of this class , was a good lady , the wife of a devoted friend to American freedom , who was at the moment engaged in preparing a batch of bread for the oven .

		The house she occupied was directly in the range of the meeting-house , and liable to be struck by every discharge .

		Her brother , anxious for her safety , came in , and informing her of the danger , desired her to take her child , and proceed by a circuitous route to a place beyond the reach of the enemy 's guns , while he would rally a company to resist any attempt to land .

		To this she demurred ; she felt no alarm .

		Besides , her oven was heating , the bread was nearly ready ; and as to leaving before it was set in , she could not think of it !

		She was finally prevailed on to forego this resolution and retire .

		As she was passing around the south-eastern corner of the common , curiosity prevailed over apprehension , and , climbing upon the wall , she stood in full view of the enemy 's vessel , surveying the scene , until a cannon-ball striking the earth near her , gave decided intimation that it was time to depart .

		The alarm spread rapidly , and soon men were seen with their fire-arms hurrying from , every quarter to the defence of the landing .

		Among the earliest on the ground , was Col.
Henry Herrick	PERSON	, an active member of the committee of correspondence , and whose patriotic spirit greatly contributed to the energetic action of the town in furnishing men and supplies for the army .

		The confusion of the moment did not make him forgetful of the dignity of his official character ; and with characteristic regard for effect , and disregard of danger , he appeared on the beach in full military costume , a conspicuous mark for the enemy 's aim .

		The commander of the
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	soon found himself in an awkward position .

		Owing to an unlucky choice of anchorage , the receding tide left his vessel aground , which careened so that he was unable to bring a single gun to bear .

		In the mean time , the citizens of
Salem	LOCATION	opened a fire upon her from the Hospital point , with several four and six pounders , while a number of good marksmen , concealed among the rocks on the
Beverly	LOCATION	side , rendered it hazardous for an officer or man to appear on deck .

		In this condition , without power to offer a single token of his good or ill will , he lay until dark , when , the tide floating his vessel , he weighed anchor and stood out to sea , carrying with him no very pleasant recollection of his introduction to the citizens of this town .

		INTERLEAVED ALMANACS OF
WILLIAM WETMORE	PERSON	, SALEM October 10 .

		The Nautilus of 14 or 16 guns -LRB- 6 lb -RRB- chased the Bevy Privateer in a Bevy harbr ー & fired upon her after she had run aground and was stripped for abt 4 hours .

		The
Salem	LOCATION	people , to the no of 200 or more went down upon Salem Neck & were preparing to fire upon the Ship with their field pieces when she fired the first shot among a party of them wo were collected upon a hill .

		I was myself present .

		Our men then began to play their 4 lb guns & after making 8 or 10 shot apiece they levelled them well .

		The Ship fired several times at us but after our Guns began to play she fired but seldom , and hoisted sail to go off ー when she got aground ー she got off agn abt 1/2 after 7 P.M. ー for 4 hours we fired upon her constantly & tis supposed that she recd some of our shot ー We fired very badly many times .

Dunmore	PERSON	, and the plan is to lay waste all the plantations on our river sides .

		Of this we gave immediate notice to our committee of safety by an express whom we dispatched hence last Friday -LSB- October 6 -RSB- , that if any defence could be provided on the rivers by fortifications or small vessels it might be done immediately .

		In the spring 10,000 men more are to come over .

		They are to be procured by taking away two thirds of the Garrison at
Gibralter	LOCATION	-LRB- who are to be replaced by some Hessians -RRB- by 2000 Highlanders and 5000 Roman Catholics whom they propose to raise in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Instead of the Roman Catholics however some of our accounts say foreigners are to be sent .

		Their plan is this .

		They are to take possession of
New York	LOCATION	and
Albany	LOCATION	, keeping up a communication between them by means of their vessels .

		Between
Albany	LOCATION	and St.
John	PERSON	's they propose also to keep open the communication ; and again between St.
John	PERSON	's ,
Quebec	LOCATION	, and
Boston	LOCATION	.

		By this means they expect
Gage	PERSON	,
Tryon	PERSON	and
Carleton	PERSON	may distress us on every side acting in concert with one another .

		By means of
Hudson	LOCATION	's river they expect to cut off all correspondence between the Northern and Southern rivers .

Colony	ORGANIZATION	; We therefore thinking it necessary for the Promotion of the
Common Cause	ORGANIZATION	have ordered a hundred Barrels of the Flour to be taken for the use of the said Soldiers , & doubt not it will Meet with Yr Excellencie 's Approbation ー And as the Town of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	is in great want of Bread , we should be exceeding glad if the Circumstances of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	will admit of it , that about Five hundred Barrels of the Flour might be sold to the Inhabitants of said
Portsmouth	LOCATION	& the Money desposited in the hands of some faithful Person until the Determination of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	relative to the said Cargo may be known The Sailors appear to be pleased with the Capture , but are uneasy about their Wages , & we would request your opinion whether or not they should be paid by the Sale of some Part of the Cargo .

		We would also propose to your Excellencys Consideration whether the transporting the Flour round
Cape Ann	LOCATION	will not be dangerous ; We conceive it more prudent to convey it in Small Vessels to
Ipswich	ORGANIZATION	, tho the Land Carriage from thence is further than from

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES -LSB-
Preston	PERSON	,
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- The next day -LSB- October 11 -RSB- ... it was suggested to the latter -LSB- Graves -RSB- that before the Transports could possibly get to the mouth of the
River St Lawrence	LOCATION	, Winter would be too far set in , and that Snow Storms would so endanger both Men and Vessels that it was very unlikely they should be able even to enter the
River	LOCATION	; And that therefore it was utterly improbable they should ever reach Quebec or even make their way back again to
Boston	LOCATION	, where the Cruizers already found the greatest difficulty in keeping their Stations .

		The excessive swift descent of the Tide in the
River St Lawrence	LOCATION	-LRB- the Ebb running for nine hours together and often after the rate of ten miles an hour , and the flood making but three hours -RRB- very greatly increased the peril and difficulty of the navigation , which were again augmented by the intense obscurity of Fogs , and the violent impetuosity of the N.W. Winds prevailing at , that Season : all combining rendered the art of the Navigator useless ; nor could the most skilful Pilot venture much beyond what the Sight would conduct him to .

		It would be impracticable to anchor , the strongest Cable being incapable of holding a Ship against the rapidity of the Tides , and to keep under Sail would be almost certain destruction ; insomuch that Ships had been frequently obliged to quit the River from its inclement Coast and retreat across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Upon these Considerations the Admiral , whose Earnestness to send
Succours	PERSON	had induced him to hold the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	in readiness for that
Service	ORGANIZATION	, thought it behoved him to take the opinion of Pilots and Seamen , & in particular to consult Captain -LSB-
Broderick -RSB- Hartwell	PERSON	, who had commanded the
Neptune	LOCATION	under Sir
Chas Saund	PERSON	-LSB- ers -RSB- at the Siege of
Quebec	LOCATION	, and was judged well acquainted with the
River St Lawrence	LOCATION	; and the time of the Winters setting in there .

		They all concurred in opinion : & the very experienced Officer just mentioned declared frankly that as the Transports could not be ready to sail for several days to come , they must arrive too late in the
Gulph of St Lawrence	LOCATION	to get up ; that they would be in the utmost peril of being lost , and that ; should nothing fatal happen to them , they would be obliged to run for
England	LOCATION	: he therefore strenuously advised the Admiral by no means to think of putting the Lives of so many men in such Jeopardy .

		Captain
Macartney	PERSON	, who had wintered at
Quebec	LOCATION	, agreed with Captain
Hartwell	PERSON	; And both urged so much and so strongly against the measure proposed that the Admiral at last adopted their Sentiments , and by Letter to General
Howe	PERSON	communicated the same to him .

JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	TO MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	Sir ,
Philada Octr	PERSON	11th 1775 .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	have considered your Letters of the 19th and 29th of Sept last , and directed me to assure you , that they are very sensible of the Difficulties under which you labour , and your unremitted Dilligence to remove such as may in any wise obstruct the public service .

		They most heartily lament the Loss of your Health , as well on your own , as on Account of the Public , but find some Pleasure in thinking that you are not without Consolation , when you reflect , that the Obligations of your Country are Encreased in Proportion to the Sacrifices you make to her Interest .

		Their Concern for the Public is greatly alliviated by the Abilities and
Zeal of Genl Montgomery	ORGANIZATION	, in which they can not but place the highest Confidence .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	see the Necessity of attending to the Situation of
Canada	LOCATION	, but trust that your Care and Prudence will render any Delegation from this Body unnecessary , at least for the present .

		What they expect from your Endeavours is , that the Canadians be induced to accede to an Union with these Colonies , and that they form from their several Parishes a Provincial Convention and send Delegates to this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		And as in the present unsettled State of that Country , a regular Election can hardly be expected , we must acquiesce in the Choice of such Parishes and Districts as are disposed to join us .

		You may assure them that we shall hold their Rights as dear as our own , and on their Union with us , exert out utmost Endeavours to obtain for them and their Posterity the Blessings of a free Government , and that Security to their Persons and Property , which is derived from the British Constitution .

		And you may further declare that we hold sacred the Rights of Conscience , and shall never molest them in the free Enjoyment of their Religion .

		If our Arms should be crowned with Success , you will consult with your principal Officers about the Number of Troops that will be necessary for the Defence of
Canada	LOCATION	, and for the different Posts of Crown Point and
Ticonderoga	PERSON	, and the best Method of procuring Men for those Services .

		If you should observe in the Canadians an inclination to take up arms , you may immediately , at the Expence of the Continent , raise a Regiment and appoint such officers as you conceive will be most agreeable to them , and serviceable to us .

		ー The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will endeavour to attend to the Cloathing of your Troops , and approve of your design to purchase Woollens at
Montreal	LOCATION	, which they sincerely hope it may be in your Power to accomplish .

		You may depend upon their Compliance with all Contracts made by you for the Supply of the Troops under your Command .

		The Establishment of a Civil Government in
Canada	LOCATION	is a Subject of great Consequence , and requires the most deliberate councils .

		The Temper , the Disposition and local Circumstances of our Brethern in that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	must be known , before we can form a proper Judgment on so important a Question .

		You will endeavour therefore to collect the Sentiments of the most discreet and sensible among the principal Canadians and English on this Head , and communicate their opinion , with your remarks to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the Determination of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at all Events , to keep the
Command of Lake Champlain	LOCATION	.

		They would therefore have the most effectual Measures adopted for that Purpose ; and , if our Enemies should be expelled
Montreal	LOCATION	, will exert their utmost Endeavours to secure the
River St Lawrence	LOCATION	, and prevent by Batteries , Vessels , and every other Obstruction the ministerial Troops from regaining the Possession of that Town .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	approve of the Presents made to the Coghniwagas , also of the Disposition of the prisoners , and have borrowed one Ton of gun Powder from the
Committee of Safety of this Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and directed it to be sent to the Provincial Convention of
New York	LOCATION	, with a request to transmit to you the whole , or such a Part of it , as they can spare : Nails will be supplied you , by the
Convention of New York	ORGANIZATION	, when they receive your Direction on that Head .

		They , together with the
Committee of Albany	ORGANIZATION	, and the Governor of
Connecticut	LOCATION	will on Application , furnish such Carpenters and Blacksmiths , as you may want over and above what may be procured from among the Troops .

		As for the Artificers taken from thence , you will pay them the customary Allowance if you think their Services entitle them to any Reward .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are pleased with the Mode in which you propose to settle with and pay those , who took and garrisoned Crown Point , and desire that the Accounts may be transmitted to them as soon as possible .

		Mr -LSB-
Elisha -RSB- Phelps	PERSON	will be considered as Deputy to Mr
Levingston	PERSON	-LSB-
Walter Livingston	PERSON	-RSB- for the
New York Department	ORGANIZATION	, and be paid as such at the Rate of forty Dollars per Month from his Entrance into the Service .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are greatly hurt at the Misconduct of a Part of the Troops , and hope they will take the earliest Opportunity to obliterate their Disgrace .

		It is their earnest Wish , that the strictest Discipline be observed ; For , as on the one Hand , they are resolved to reward those , who deserve their Favour , so on the other , a Regard for their Country forbids them to overlook the Offences of such as neglect their Duty , or basely betray their trust .

		I can not conclude without assuring you , that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are highly sensible of the Spirit , Activity , and Zeal , of Mr.
James Levingston	PERSON	-LSB-
Livingston	PERSON	-RSB- , from which they can not but promise themselves Advantages , that will be entitled to their earliest Recompense .

		August 31st 1775 ; To His Excellency The Governor The Address of His Majesty 's
Council of Bermuda	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー May it please Your Excellency We His Majesty 's most faithful Subjects the Council of
Bermuda	LOCATION	have considered Your Excellency 's Speech of Yesterday with all the Attention which the Importance of the matter recommended to us so justly demands .

		ー We assure Your Excellency We are still Affected with the deepest and most unfeigned Concern for the Robbery committed on the
Powder Magazine	ORGANIZATION	, and tho ' we are happy in reflecting that every Method was immediately taken for the Detection of the Perpetrators of that most atrocious and execreable Act ー which the united Wisdom of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	could suggest , Yet we at the same time Sincerely lament that the Offenders have hitherto remained undiscovered .

		ー We join with Your Excellency in Opinion that in our present defenceless State -LRB- arising principally from that most villainous Robbery -RRB- the utmost care shou 'd be taken of the Cannon , but we rather beg leave to Advise that Your Excellency would be pleased -LSB- to -RSB- use Your Influence with Capt : Tollemache to continue here 'till he can be relieved by some other Vessel of War , and we are the more strongly induced to give this Measure a preference to that recommended by your Excellency , as a large , arm 'd Sloop -LRB- supposed to be from some of the
North American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has for several Days past been seen hovering about our
Coast	LOCATION	, ー This Circumstance is truly alarming and gives us the greatest reason to imagine that some Attempt may be made against the
Island	LOCATION	, which , -LRB- should it even be with a Vessel of but small Force -RRB- for want of Powder and from the ruinous Condition our Fortifications are now in , we should be unable to defeat ; We therefore flatter Ourselves that Captain
Tollemache	PERSON	will readily comply with a request of this Nature from your Excellency , as it must not only tend to secure the Cannon alluded to in Your Excellency 's Speech but also the Cannon on the several Forts and Fortifications , which we conceive to be in imminent Danger for the Reasons we have just mentioned .

		ー By Order of the Board .

		COUNT DE NOZIÈRES TO VICE ADMIRAL JAMES YOUNG Sir Point a Pitre ,
Guadeloupe	LOCATION	, 11 October 1775 I have received the letter which Your Excellency did me the honor of writing , dated 7th October , which has been sent to me here by the frigate of his
Britannic Majesty	ORGANIZATION	which has anchored at Basse Terre : By this dispatch you tell me that Captain -LSB-
Grant -RSB- Gordon	PERSON	, commanding the frigate Argo having put into the harbor at
St. Pierre	LOCATION	in
Martinique	LOCATION	has reported that a very pernicious trade is taking place there , -LSB- the -RSB- furnishing -LSB- of -RSB- powder and other munitions of war to the colonials of
New England	LOCATION	.

		I can assure Your Excellency that I have no knowledge of it , I gave my orders a long time ago that no one was to allow anything of that nature to leave our ports : But
St. Pierre	LOCATION	is a trading place where all the commodities of
Europe	LOCATION	are traded with every foreigner , without distinction ; and it is quite possible that the merchant with only his own interest in view traded in some of these articles without my having any knowledge of it nor of their destination .

		Your Excellency tells me in the second place that these kinds of merchandize were exported in American Ships , which had on board French masters , and that the vessels of his
Britannic Majesty	ORGANIZATION	, which encountered them at sea , seized them as contraband .

		I have the honor of replying on this subject to Your Excellency that , following our own laws , a French master would not be enough to characterize the vessel he commands as such it is necessary also that the greater part of the crew be composed of nationals , and that the ship be furnished with French sailing orders in good form and specifying its destination .

		Every ship in the state I have just described to Your Excellency could not be siezed by those of his
Britannic Majesty	ORGANIZATION	without a clear infraction of maritime rights recognized among civilized nations unless however in the actual situation they are encountered in the vicinity of
New England	LOCATION	carrying munitions of war for that colony .

		As for the improper action of Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	in the roadstead at
St. Pierre which M. de Choiseul	ORGANIZATION	has told me about , I refer to what I had the honor of writing to Your Excellency by the Signeur de Montaigu commander of His Most Christian Majesty 's troops , I shall add only that Captain
Gordon	PERSON	was not able to visit under any admissable grounds ships which anchor in a French roadstead , being under the protection of His Most Christian Majesty , this act of violence would not be suffered even in time of war in any neutral port , and Captain
Gordon	PERSON	has carried his delinquency to the greatest excess by acting to haul down the colors of His Most Christian Majesty in order to substitute those of his
Britannic Majesty	ORGANIZATION	.

		Therefore , I can only approve the action followed by Count de Choiseul concerning the indiscreet request Captain
Gordon	PERSON	made to him in regard to seizing ships in our ports : The imprudent acts of Captain
Gordon	PERSON	can not be excused in any case , not even under the special pretext of an utmost Zeal for the service of his
Britannic Majesty	ORGANIZATION	and I am entirely persuaded that Your Excellency can not think otherwise .

		The desire I have of maintaining union and friendship , which , I hope still exists between our respective nations , will cause me to pay particular attention to the choice I make of the officers who can visit your ports , in order that their conduct can not diminish the harmony which has always existed between the governments of these colonies , and I hope that Your Excellency will do the same in recommending to all those under his orders an equal prudence when they are in our ports .

		I have the honor of being with the greatest esteem & c. The
Count de Noziere	ORGANIZATION	1 .

WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, Octr 12th 1775 .

		Before I was honoured with your Favour of the 5th Inst .

		I had given Orders for the equipment of some armed Vessels to intercept the
Enemyies Supplies of Provisions & Ammunition	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of them was on a Cruize between
Cape Ann & Cape Cod	ORGANIZATION	when the Express arrived .

		The others will be fit for the Sea in a few Days under the Command of Officers of the
Continental Army	ORGANIZATION	, who are well recommended as Persons acquainted with the Sea , and capable of such a Service .

		Two of these will be immediately dispatched on this Duty , and every Particular mentioned in your Favour of the 5h Inst litterally complied with .

		That the
Honble Congress	ORGANIZATION	may have a more complete Idea of the Plan on which these Vessels are equipped , I enclose a Copy of the Instructions given to the Capt. now out -LRB- No 4 -RRB- 2 These , with the additional Instructions directed , will be given to the Captains who go into the Mouth of
St. Lawrence 's River	LOCATION	.

		As both Officers & Men most chearfully engage in the Service on the Terms mentioned in these Instructions , I fear that the proposed Encrease will create some Difficulty , by making a Difference between Men engaged on similar Service .

		I have therefore not yet communicated this Part of the Plan , but reserved an Extra Bounty as a Reward for extraordinary Activity .

		There are no armed Vessels in this Province , and Govr -LSB-
Nicholas -RSB- Cooke	PERSON	informs me the Enterprize can receive no Assistance from him , as one of the armed Vessels of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	is on a long Cruize , and the other unfit for the Service .

		Nothing shall be omitted to secure Success .

		A fortunate Capture of an Ordnance Ship would give new Life to the Camp , and an immediate Turn to the Issue of the Campaign .

		Our last Accounts from Col.
Arnold	PERSON	are very favourable .

		He was proceeding with all Expedition , and I flatter myself making all Allowances , he will be at
Quebec	LOCATION	the 20h Inst. , where , a Gentleman from
Canada	LOCATION	-LRB- Mr
Brice	PERSON	-RRB- assures me , he will meet with no Resistance ... From the various Accounts received from
Europe	LOCATION	, there may be Reason to expect Troops will be landed at
New York	LOCATION	, or some other

Cambridge	LOCATION	, October 12 .

		Last Tuesday -LSB- October 10 -RSB- one of our Privateers from
Beverly	LOCATION	, 1 having been on a Cruize in the
Bay	LOCATION	, was followed , on her Return into Port , by the Nautilus Man of War .

		The Privateer run aground in a Cove a little without
Beverly Harbour	LOCATION	, where the People speedily assembled , stripped her , and carried her Guns , & c. ashore .

		The Man of War was soon within Gunshot , when she also got aground ; she however let go an Anchor , and bringing her Broadside to bear , began to fire upon the Privateer .

		The People of
Salem	LOCATION	and
Beverly	PERSON	soon returned the Compliment from a Number of Cannon on Shore , keeping up a warm and well directed Fire on the Man of War for 2 or 3 Hours , and it is supposed did her considerable Damage , and probably killed and wounded some of the Men ; but before they could board her , which they were preparing to do , the Tide arose about 8 o'Clock in the Evening , when she cut her Cable , and got off .

		Some of her Shot struck one or two Buildings in
Beverly	LOCATION	; but no Lives were lost on our Side , and the Privateer damaged very little if any .

Nautilus Boston Bay	ORGANIZATION	12 Octr 1775 The 10th instant saw standing into
Salem	LOCATION	a Schooner , the one I supposed I was in quest after , and followed her into a little Bay near to
Beverley Bar	LOCATION	, in which she run ashore , and I got in as near as possible just within Grape ; after firing some Shot they left her , as she was aground and very near the beach thought it best to endeavour setting her on fire , immediately hoisted out the Boats , and got Combustibles ready for that purpose , but by this time she was quite dry , and render 'd it impracticable , and I continued firing a Number of Shots into her , this Alarm brought great Numbers of armed people to different Stations of Security and a smart fire of Musquetry and Swivels took Place , soon after a fire from
Salem	LOCATION	Side with three Pieces of Cannon , at different Stations , so well chosen that I could not see them with my Glass ; and at such a distance as to put it out of my power to return the Complement with that effect I could have wished , so that after exchanging Shot for some time to no purpose , not being able to destroy the Schooner , thought it time to get under way which could not be effected but by bringing a Spring on the Cable to cast her , as the Wind blew on the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	to which I was very near , and obliged me to leave the Anchor ; notwithstanding this precaution very soon after took the Ground , and , in this Situation received a great many Shot mostly in my Rigging and Sails , about 20 through the Hammacoes and
Hull	PERSON	, one Gun dismounted , and a Swivel shot in two ; one man has lost his Leg , and another wounded in the Side .

		't is very lucky they fired so high .

		LETTER FROM
BRISTOL	LOCATION	,
RHODE ISLAND	LOCATION	, TO A
NEW YORK	LOCATION	CORRESPONDENT Dear Sir ,
Bristol	LOCATION	, Oct. 12 , 1775 .

		Having observed in the last
Newport Mercury	LOCATION	, an imperfect account relative to the conduct of his Majesty 's ships , under the command of Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	at
Bristol	LOCATION	, last Saturday night -LSB- October 7 -RSB- .

		I embrace this opportunity to give you a true and particular detail of facts , that took place , from their anchoring in the harbour till they left the town .

		ー ー ー On Saturday the 7th instant , P.M. appeared in sight of this harbour , a very formidable fleet , consisting of 16 sail , viz. three men of war , one bomb ketch , and other armed vessels , all which , excepting the
Glasgow	LOCATION	-LRB- who ran ashore at
Paquash	LOCATION	point -RRB- drew up in a line of battle , from one end of the town to the other : soon after they had moored , a barge came from the Rose , to the head of a wharf , with the Lieutenant , who asking if there were any gentlemen on the wharf ?


William Bradford	PERSON	being present , answered yes ; whereupon the Lieutenant informed him , Captain
Wallace	PERSON	had a demand to make on the town , and desired that two or three of the principal men , or magistrates of the town , would go on board his ship , within an hour , and hear his proposals , otherwise hostilities would be commenced against the town .

		the above gentleman replied as a magistrate , that , in his opinion , Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	was under a greater obligation to come ashore , and make his demands known to the town , than for the magistrates to go on board his ship to hear them , and added , that if Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	would come to the head of the wharf the next morning , he should be treated as a gentleman , and the town would consider of his demands ; with this answer the Lieutenant returned on board the Rose .

		The inhabitants being made acquainted with the above conversation , repaired to the wharf , and waited with the utmost impatience for a reply from Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	, till an hour had expired , when the whole fleet began a most heavy cannonading , and the bomb vessel to bombard , and heave shells and carcases into the town ; which continued without imtermission , an hour and an half .

		In the mean time Col.
-LSB- Stephen -RSB- Potter	PERSON	, in the hottest of the fire , went upon the head of the wharf , hailed the Rose , went on board and requested a cessation of hostilities , 'till the inhabitants might choose a committee to go on board and treat with Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	; which request was complied with ; and six hours were allowed for the above purpose .

		Col.
Potter	PERSON	returned and made a report to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of inspection , who chose a select committee to hear Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	's demands , which , after they had gone on board , Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	informed them were a supply of 200 sheep and 30 fat cattle .

		This demand , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	replied , it was impossible to comply with ; for the country people had come in and drove off their stock , saving a few sheep and some milch cows .

		After some hours had expired , during the negociation , without coming to any agreement , Captain
Wallace	PERSON	told them , I have this one proposal to make , `` If you will promise to supply me with 40 sheep , at or before twelve o'clock , I will assure you that another gun shall not be discharged . ''

		The committee .

		seeing themselves reduced to the distressing alternative , either to supply their most inveterate enemy with provisions , or devote to the flames the town , with all the goods , besides near 100 sick persons , who could not be removed without the utmost hazard of their lives ; I say , seeing themselves reduced to this dreadful dilemma , of two evils reluctantly chose the least , by agreeing to supply them with 40 sheep at the time appointed , which was punctually performed .

		The Rev. Mr.
John Burt	PERSON	having been confined to his house by the camp distemper , when the cannonading began left his habitation , to seek some place of safety ; and the next day was found dead in a neighbouring field .

		It is con jectured that being overcome with fear and fatigue , he fell down and was unable to raise himself up , and so expired .

		A child also of Capt.
Timothy Ingraham	PERSON	, having been removed in the rain , died the next day .

		What equally challenges our administration and gratitude to God is , that no more lives were lost , or persons hurt , by such an incessant and hot fire ; the streets being full of men , women and children , the whole time ; the shrieks of the women , the cries of the children , and groans of the sick , would have extorted a tear from even the eye of a Nero .

		ー But I forbear ー words ca n't describe the dreadful scene .

		After the ships had received their supply , and stole about 90 cheeses , and some poultry , from
Papaquash	LOCATION	, they weighed anchor , and moored at
Papaquash	LOCATION	point ; the next day -LRB- being Tuesday -RRB- they went into
Bristol	LOCATION	ferry way and fired a number of shot at the houses and people on each shore , where three of them got a ground ; but the tide rising towards evening , they left us , and have not molested us since .

		A great number of dwelling-houses & c. were shot through ; but suffered very little damage .

		A cannon ball entered a distill-house , then passed through three hogsheads and barrels of rum , and spilt their contents .

		-LSB- Footnote added by editor of the
New Yark Gazette	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- The Rev. Mr.
Burt	PERSON	was born in
Boston	LOCATION	, and having received a liberal education at
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, he was ordained pastor of the Congregational church in
Bristol	LOCATION	, where he laboured in the work of the ministry 34 years .

		He was a gentleman of a respectable character .

John Lawrence	PERSON	sailed from
London	LOCATION	the 2d of August ; left
Falmouth	LOCATION	the 14th : says , he made it his business to get all the intelligence he could with respect to the intentions of Government against the Colonies .

		That 23 ships from 40 guns and under were fitting out for the American service , to relieve the ships which were deemed too large , which he understood were to be recalled .

		That they were not all to come out this fall on account of the carpenters leaving the yards ; that he understood 5 regiments were to come from
Ireland	LOCATION	, 3 regiments from
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	, and 5 companies of artillery ; that a large quantity of ordnance was shipping for
America	LOCATION	, and that five transports with provisions were sailed for
Boston	LOCATION	before he sailed ; that he understood the troops were destined for
Boston	LOCATION	; that he heard that 4 or 5 of the transports had sailed for
Ireland	LOCATION	, to take the troops on board before he sailed ; that he saw 4000 stand of arms shipped for
Quebec	LOCATION	; that 2 brigs sailed out of the Downs in company with him laden with warlike stores ; that they sailed without convoy ; that they had a lieutenant on board each but no troops ; that he understood the arms were for the use of the Canadians ; that he did not hear of any troops going to

Embden	LOCATION	, and 16,000 Hessians and Hanoverians were intended for
America	LOCATION	; But whether they were to proceed immediately to
America	LOCATION	or touch in
England	LOCATION	was not certain ; reports differing relative thereto .

		That the report of employing Hessians and Hanoverians took place before the account of Bunker Hill battle ; that the people seemed to be much exasperated against the Americans on receiving the account of Bunker Hill that the merchants in general were opposed to the Americans ; that they were much pleased on hearing that 15,000 of the provincials were killed and taken prisoners by about 1700 regulars ; but when the true state of the battle arrived they made long faces ; that he did not hear of their building any flat-bottomed boats ; that the news of taking

America	LOCATION	to 30,000 men this fall ; that there was no complaint of the manufacturers wanting employ , and it was generally supposed that the administration kept them employed ; that the people in general thought New-York worse than any of the other Colonies for disappointing them , not only by joining the other Colonies , but by acting more vigorously than the rest ; that he heard there was more than ordinary demands for British goods by the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	; that the manufacturers in
Ireland	LOCATION	were quiet , but wished well to the Americans ; that the people in
England	LOCATION	were anxious to hear from the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, expecting some offer of accomodation .

		That it was reported that on the news of
Bunker Hill	ORGANIZATION	, the stocks fell a little , but afterwards rose again ; that he heard of no disunion in the councils of administration ; that great numbers of vessels were laid up in the Thames owing to the stopping of the American trade ; that it was generally expected in

		12 , 1775 I have inclosed a Paper upon which I will make no Remark : But leave you to your own Conjectures ー only I must absolutely insist that it be mentioned to nobody .

		It may gratify your Curiosity and give some Relief to your Cares .

		2 I most earnestly pray that all my Friends would exert themselves to furnish me with Intelligence of a particular Nature .

		I mean with a List of all the Depradations committed upon our Trade ; a List of all the Vessels which have been taken by the Cutters ,
Cruizers	PERSON	, & c. ; the Names of the Vessells , Masters , owners ; Burthen of the Ship , the Nature of the Cargo 's , and the Value of both .

		Nothing will contribute so much to facilitate Reprizals , as an exact Account of our Losses and Damages .

		I wish our
General Court	ORGANIZATION	would take it up and examine it thoroughly .

		Outline of Proposal for Procuring Powder .

		See next entry .

		OUTLINE OF PROPOSAL FOR PROCURING POWDER -LSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, October 12 -RSB- As the Article of Powder is much wanted to carry on the operations vs. the
Ministerial Army	ORGANIZATION	, and as the british
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	have taken Every Step that human Nature could devise to prevent the Americans obtaining so essential an Article ; it is humbly Submitted to the wisdom of the Cont .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	, whether it will not be prudent to Supply themselves with that Article at the Expence of the said
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	by taking it wherever they can get it .

		It is therefore recommended that 2 Vessells properly mann 'd be sent to the Island of
Antigua	LOCATION	one of which may anchor at
old Road	LOCATION	on the
South Side	LOCATION	of the said Island -LRB- where there are only a few Houses -RRB- in the Evening under Dutch Colours ; passing for a Vessell bound on a forced Trade , to the
French Islands	LOCATION	; in the night they may land , and take away all the powder ; there being not above one or two Persons , in the fort to prevent it .

		As soon as the Powder is obtained the Vessell may proceed down to
Johnsons Point Fort	LOCATION	, at the S.W. point of the Island ; and take what is there ; there being only a single Matross in the said Fort ; the other Vessell must be commanded by a prudent Man , well acquainted with the Bar and
Harbour	LOCATION	at
St. Johns	LOCATION	; if any Man of War be anchored without the Bar ; it will not be prudent to attempt any Thing , but should there be none ; the Vessell may then go over the Bar , and anchor close under the fort ; as is commonly the Custom .

		There are generally 10 or 12 Soldiers in
James Fort Situated	ORGANIZATION	on a Point on the larboard Hand , Seven miles distant from the Town ; the Magazine is in a hollow ; on the Left hand just after entering the Gate , and commonly contains from 500 to 1000 Blls .

		of Powder , or more .

		2 miles from thence to the northward is a Small fort called
Corbresons	ORGANIZATION	point fort ; and 2 miles from this northward is another Small fort called
Dickensons	PERSON	bay fort , in either of which there is not above a Single Matross .

		All this Powder may be easily obtained without any Opposition , if conducted with Prudence ; it will be necessary that the Captn should have some Money , to distribute among the Soldiers , to assist in taking it away ; He may go into the
Fort	LOCATION	in the afternoon -LRB- and See how the Land lies -RRB- under pretence of Sailing that night , and thereby guide his operation .

		The same Thing may be done by other Vessells at
Montserrat	LOCATION	,
Nevis	LOCATION	,
Charles	PERSON	fort at
Sandy	PERSON	point ,
St	LOCATION	:
Kitts	PERSON	, also at
St. Martens	LOCATION	; without any Risque .

		I would advise the continental
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to make a general Sweep of all the Powder , at
St. Eustatius	LOCATION	, it may first be taken and then paid for afterwards as the Dutch refuse to sell it to us ; I am well persuaded the whole of this Plan may be executed , and that near 3000 Blls of powder may be obtained in the Course of 3 or 4 months .

		The particular place where the office will be erected is not yet fixed , but it will be so near

		BRIGADIER GENERAL
RICHARD MONTGOMERY	PERSON	TO MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	Dear General , Camp near
St. Johns Octr	LOCATION	.

		13th Some Time ago I informed you of my Intentions to make my approaches on the
West Side	LOCATION	, as soon as the expected Reinforcement enabled me to undertake it .

		I had had a Road cut to the intended Ground & some
Fascines	LOCATION	made when I was informed by Major
Brown	PERSON	that a general Dissatisfaction prevailed , that unless something was undertaken in a few Days there would be a Meeting , & that the universal Sense of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	was to direct all our Intentions to the
East Side	LOCATION	.

		The Impatience of the Troops to get Home has prevented their seeing the Impossibility of undertaking this Business sooner , the Duty being hard for the Troops even on the present confined State of Operations .

		When I mentioned my Intentions I did not consider I was at the Head of Troops who carry the
Spirit of Freedom	ORGANIZATION	into the Field & think for themselves .

		Upon considering the fatal Consequences which might flow from a Want of Subordination & Discipline should this ill
Humour	PERSON	continue my unstable Authority over Troops of different Colonies , the Insufficiency of the military Law , & my own Want of Power to enforce it , weak as it is , I thought it expedient to call the Field officers together .

		Enclosed I have sent you the Result of our Deliberations .

		I still suspect the
Garrison	PERSON	intend an Elopement , and there is some Reason to think they are getting Flat Boats ready to go down the Rapids .

		This Intelligence is just come .

		The Canadians who have befriended us begin to be exceedingly uneasy at their Situation should we not succeed .

		I have ventured to assure them , should any Accident oblige us to retire without effecting our Business , that I would take Care of all those who were afraid to remain in the Country .

		You will see the Propriety of putting
Tionderoga	PERSON	in a State of Defence against a Winter Coup de Main , which in my Opinion will be best effected by a Stockade , and also of having a Post at
Crown Point	LOCATION	.

		The Vessels should lie in
Stockade	LOCATION	also , the Garrison be well provided with Vegetables and every Thing necessary to make them comfortable ; otherwise it will be difficult to keep them there ; And such Preparation made for a naval Armament in the Spring that the Troops may move down to the
Isle Aux Noix	LOCATION	before Mr
Carleton	PERSON	has Time to establish himself there should those unhappy Troubles continue .

Philip Schuyler	PERSON	-RRB- , 153 , I , 226 , 227 , NA .

		BRIGADIER GENERAL
RICHARD MONTGOMERY	PERSON	'S REPORT OF HIS CONFERENCE WITH HIS OFFICERS I proposed establishing a battery of all our spare heavy Cannon on the rising ground exactly opposite the Stone house in the North redoubt , ー -LRB- in the West face of which there is but one embrazure open -RRB- at the distance of about 100 yards , Securing this battery with a work Capable of being well defended by 200 Men .

		From this battery our approaches might be continued to the ditch , & by the time we arrive there , the fraze round the berm would be destroyed , the rampart in a ruinous state , & the large house -LRB- which is said to be their principal barrack -RRB- would be destroyed , as every Shot that missed the rampart must take the house .

		Two four pounders on the
East Side	LOCATION	would answer the end of seeing the west rampart in reverse , & thereby slackening the opposition of the enemy .

		By this mode of proceeding , if our ammunition held out , there would be in my opinion some prospect of success , notwithstanding the superior artillery of the Garrison , which could not be mounted in its proper place time enough to prevent the erection of our battery .

		The field Officers were to a man of opinion that my reasons were insufficient , being afraid the design 'd ground was at this season too wet for approaches , & Strongly of opinion our heavy cannon on the east side would more effectually distress the enemy by annoying their buildings , the
Fort	LOCATION	having a Gentle slope to the river & which was urged as the strongest motive by destroying their Schooner .

		In vain I represented if every building was destroy 'd , the garrison could not surrender without a probability of an assault , which could never arise from any attack on the opposite side of the river that the vessel could not be destroyed , because she would change her place in such a manner as to elude our batteries that we had little powder or time to throw away on experiments that I had a moral certainty they would find themselves mistaken & finally that they must take it upon themselves ; for I would not oppose the general sence of the army , & should enforce the measure by every effort in my power .

		I can not help observing to how little purpose I am here .

		Were I not afraid the example would be too generally followed & that the publick service might suffer , I would not stay an hour at the head of Troops whose operations I can not direct ー I must say I have no hopes of Success from the garrisons wanting provisions .

		13th Octor 1775 May it please your Excellency A person going down the River presents the first Opportunity I have had of writing to your Excellency , since I left Fort Western , since which we have had a very fatigueing time , the Men in general not understanding
Batteaus	PERSON	have been obliged to wade & haul them more than half way up the River ー the last Division is just arrived ー three Divisions are over the first Carrying place , & as the Men are in high Spirits , I make no doubt of reaching the
River Chaudiere	LOCATION	in Eight or Ten Days , the greatest difficulty being I hope already past .

		We have now with us about twenty five days provisions for the whole Detachment , Consisting of about Nine hundred & fifty effective men .

		I intend making an exact return , but must defer it untill I come to Chaudiere ー I have order 'd the Commissary to hire people acquainted with the River & forward on the Provisions left behind -LRB- about 100 barrells -RRB- to the great Carrying place , to secure our retreat the expence will be Considerable , but when set in Competition with the Lives or Liberties of so many brave men , I think it trifling , & if we Succeed , the Provisions will not be lost .

		I have had no intelligence from Genl -LSB-
Philip -RSB- Schuyler	PERSON	or
Canada	LOCATION	, & expect none 'till I reach
Chaudiere Pond	LOCATION	, where I expect a Return of my Express , & to determine my plan of operation which as it is to be govern 'd by Circumstances , I can say no more than if we are oblig 'd to return I believe we shall have a sufficiency of provisions to reach this place where the Supply order 'd the Commissary to send forward , will enable us to return on our way home so far that your Excellencv will be able to relieve us , if we proceed on we shall have a sufficient Stock to reach the French Inhabitants -LRB- where we can be supplied -RRB- if not Quebec ー Your Excellency may possibly think we have been tardy in our march , as we have gained so Little , but when you Consider the badness & weight of the Batteaus , and large quantity 's of Provisions & c. we have been obliged to force up against a very rapid Stream , where you would have taken the men for Amphibious Animals , as they were a great part of the time under water , add to this the great Fatigue in

NAUTICUS	ORGANIZATION	'' TO
PENNSYLVANIA	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY Gentlemen ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the 13th of Oct , 1775 .

		This informs you of a method I have considered of to defend this City against any Vessels that may come up this River with an intent to do it damage ; whether my proposals may be of any advantage , I will not presume to say , I leave that to your superior knowledge , And to whose Province it alone belongs ; However , as an American , I think it my duty to contribute to promote the American cause as far as my abilities extends against its Enemies .

		First .

		The narrowness of the River and the rapid tide , Is a great advantage to the Steering fire Vessels on board the Enemy , By which means they may be burnt or Terrified in such a manner as to occasion them to quit the River .

		There is nothing can be thought of that will be of so much Service as fire Vessels rightly mannaged .

		Secondly .

		The method of fitting them for that purpose should be consulted by those who have a knowledge of fire works , which is to be filled with such Combustables as to make a furious , Instantaneous flame , And also to have some solider fuel , which when fired , will continue the Fire furiously .

		Thirdly .

		This should be done in such manner , that the fire Vessel should not be turned a Drift , which I think may be Effected by an Iron fixed on the stem of the fire Vessel , with a sharp point ragged , and to give the fire Vessel such way through the water as to be sufficient to peirce or enter the side of the Ship so far as not to draw , and to have it made to break short off by the force of the Tide , and then with a Chain , one end fas -LRB- to the part in the Ship , and the other end fast in the eye-bolt fixed in a proper place in the fire Vessel , will bring her up alongside with a force , that will drive sharp points ragged into the Ship , and the fire Vessel will be fast fore and aft , in such a manner as the
Enemy	ORGANIZATION	will be at a loss to find out , as all this may be fixed under water where they can not see , which will put the Enemy in Great confusion ; -LRB- Lett the Ships be Large or small they will all burn . -RRB-

		I shall employ my thoughts on what may be of further Advantage if this is worth your notice ; and experiment of the above Scheme may be seen and properly demonstrated for a small expence .

		I am , Gentlemen , your most humble Servant ,
Nauticus	ORGANIZATION	There is other ways of making use of fire masheins , but what I have now given an account of will be the least suspected of any , and is most likely to answer the purpose .

		Are they yet convinced of this , or will they be very soon ?

		Besides , if they should , Would it be Sound Policy in Us to admit them ?

		Would it not be sounder to confine the Benefit and the Bargain to one or a few ?

		Is it not wiser to send our own Ships to all maritime Powers , and admit private adventurers from foreign

MACHIAS	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY TO THE
MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	GENERAL COURT Gentlemen , During the absence of Captn -LSB-
Jeremiah -RSB- Obrien	PERSON	, the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of this place commissioned Captn
Stephen Smith	PERSON	to take Charge of the Private-teer , & bring in here the
Brigg Loyal Briton	LOCATION	owned by
Messrs Archibald Wilson	PERSON	,
James Anderson	PERSON	,
John Greenlaw	PERSON	,
David Black	PERSON	and
John Semple	PERSON	who had sent her to
St John 's River	LOCATION	in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	to load with
Cattle & c. for the Army	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	ORGANIZATION	; & upon Captn Smiths Arrival there , he found the said
Brigg	PERSON	loaded & weighing Anchor .

		He thereupon took Immediate possession of her , without opposition and after taking the provision found in the Fort , burning the Fort , and taking a Copora1 & two Privates , with two women & five Children he proceeded with his Prize & Prisoners , -LRB- Mr
John Semple	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	and
David Ross	PERSON	the mate excepted , who found means to Escape -RRB- , directly to this Place .

		An exact Inventory of the Goods taken in the Brigg and in the Fort we send enclosed .

		The Cattle , sheep , Hogs , smoked
Salmon & Butter	ORGANIZATION	; we have divided among the people , who took them , except one third part reserved in the Hands of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	for publick use : The other things are all Stored , & await the orders of the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two private Soldiers , with their wives & Children , at their earnest request , we have sent back to
St Johns	LOCATION	, taking it for granted that they would be not only useless , but expensive lumber in the western parts of this Colony :
William Miller	PERSON	the Pilot of the Brigg and three seamen are permitted to ship on board the Privateteer , and Captn Fredireck Sterling only , the Master of the Brigg , and the Corporal above-mentioned are sent to Court .

		Captn Sterling has much to say for himself , but his conduct is not altogether unexceptionable : All we can .

		say is , that he is a North-Briton .

		We have given him part of his private venture , & reserve the rest 'till the pleasure of the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	is known .


John Anderson Esqr	PERSON	was also on board the Brigg , as a passenger who was dismissed & suffered to return to his own Home , not because he appeared to be a cordial friend to the Cause , in which we have embarked our all , but because he belonged to another Province .

		Nothing material has since happened , for we can do but little .

		We now beg leave to return your honors our Humble & hearty thanks for the many favors already confered upon us , of which we shall ever retain the most grateful remembrance .

		It would give us the highest satisfaction to find ourselves able , thro ' the Aid you have graciously given us , both in the
Land & sea Service	ORGANIZATION	, to protect & support ourselves , without giving your Honors any further trouble : But such are our Necessitous circumstances , thro ' the almost total failure of our commerce , upon which we have hitherto subsisted & by which we have rose to such magnitude , as to be in some measure worthy of your Honors attention , the Admtration of this Vast Continent and the dread of
Halifax	LOCATION	, and the brittish
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, that we have no other alternative , but Either to '' sink '' ー or to make a most humble and dutiful application to our avowed , beloved , & beneficent Guardians .

		We are therefore under the disagreeable necessity of adding : That we have drawn a bill upon your Honors in favor of Mr Wm Shey of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	for a Cargo of provisions , a Copy of which , together with the Letter of advice given with it ; we send enclosed .

		We could not but View the arrival of this cargo of provision as a very remarkable interposition of Divine Providence , in our behalf , & thought our .

		selves indispensably bound to treat the benevolent Instrument by which it came , with honor , But purchase we could not , Lumber would not answer , and all the Cash we could collect in the whole place was but barely sufficient to pay the freight .

		To suffer this provision to depart from us , & go elsewhere , would have been the heighth of distraction , as we were then in want , and armed Plunderers infested all our coasts , and picked up all the provision they could find ; and especially when we add , we had no prospect of either Quails or Manna .

		The sacred laws of self-preservation , therefore , deserved respect to Mr Shey , the tender obligations , that subsist between the Guardian & his beneficiary , & the Mutual affection of Indulgent parents & dutiful Children , all conspired to Justify ; & even recommend a draught upon the General Court of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		The bill is drawn , & a copy of it now lies before you .

		If it is duly honored , our
Mills	LOCATION	, our boards , our Shingles & c our houses and not to Mention the sloop Mechias Liberty , sloop Unity , the
Margeretta	LOCATION	, Diligent , Tatamagouch , or the Infidel reclaimed -LRB- once Loyal Briton -RRB- our all is yours , 'till the whole is repaid .

		This may soon be done , for we are both able & willing to pay the whole amount of said
Bill	PERSON	in lumber , on Demand .

		If this bill is not Honored , we tremble at the consequence !

		On this occassion we send Mr
George Stillman	PERSON	, as our Representative , who was chosen by the Town for that purpose : And with him we send the Accounts of our expence , in burying the Dead , who fell in the day of battle , or died of the wounds they then received , in taking care of the wounded , & in supporting the prisoners & conveying them to Head Quarters , except the
Doctrs Bill	PERSON	, & the persons who attended him , which we choose they should present themselves .

		The charges of those persons , who were lately at the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	, & Mr
Stephen Jones	PERSON	's we have sent as they brought them in to us .

		But all the rest we have examined , and Approved .

		We are heartily grieved to see our expences run so high , but we see no way to reduce them any lower without doing apparent injustice .

		We have other enormous expences among ourselves which we never mean to mention in the ears of Government , for the greater part of us have spent almost our whole time in public service Since the taking of the first Tender .

		We are but an handful & every publick exertion required the most of our strength .

		And were your Honors graciously to add , to your parental bounty in the land & Sea Service of this place , which we esteem a rich & signal favor , all the Prizes we have taken , we should still be sufferers .

		ー we ask not a farthing more than we have merited ; we expect , we are willing , to suffer with our brethren , for it is honorable & Glorious to suffer in this Cause .

		Your Honors are well Acquainted with our infant state , with our critical situation , & with all we have done in support of the invaluable priviledges of
America	LOCATION	, &
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and we rest assured that you will not permit us to suffer beyond Measure ... We also beg leave to recommend to your Honors Notice the Widow
McNiel	PERSON	& her orphan children who are left under very poor circumstances .

		Mr
John Berry	PERSON	who has a family
Ebenezar Beal of Old York	PERSON	, an old Man &
Isaac Taft	PERSON	&
James Cole	PERSON	, young men , may not be , perhaps , unworthy of Notice .

		These were all badly wounded , and it is doubtful whether they will ever be capable of business , as they were before , or not .

		The last mentioned is still confined .

		Before we conclude , we must observe , that on the 8th Instant Eleven Deserters from the
Somerset	LOCATION	at
Halifax	LOCATION	arrived here , who informed us that the Tartar & two Sloops of war are now up the
Bay of Funday	ORGANIZATION	, & that a Schooner of 14 Carriage Guns & 50 men , was fitting out at
Halifax	LOCATION	in order to Join two other Tenders , and proceed directly against this place .

		ー Eight of the said deserters are inlisted on board the
Sloop Machias Liberty	ORGANIZATION	.

		Should Armed Vessels come against us we should be in danger of falling a sacrifice , for we are very Scant of Powder ; as almost all that was taken in the Diligent was destroy 'd , Some body poured water into it privately .

		We earnestly beg therefore , that your Honors would please to send us more .

		ー We are Gentlemen most respectfully your most Dutiful & Humble Servants By order of the
Committee of Safety Machias Octr	ORGANIZATION	14th 1775 Ja s

		CAPTAIN
JAMES WALLACE R.N.	PERSON	, TO VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES -LRB- Copy -RRB- Rose ,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	14th Octor 1775 .

		Sir , I am honor 'd with yours of the 12th 17th Ulto & ca by the Viper and
Bolton	PERSON	who arrived here the 4th Inst with two Transports , a small Schooner for
Virginia	LOCATION	, and a Packet for York ー The Viper , Schooner and Packet Sai ` led immediately for
New York	LOCATION	.

		I engaged the quantity of Stock necessary for the Transports and began taking it on board when intelligence flew thro ' the Country .

		ー Expresses sent off for the
Rebel Camp	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー The Rebel Governor
Cooke	PERSON	of
Providence	LOCATION	raised the Country sent down 1500 Men to
Newport	LOCATION	to prevent us , However I got all that could be got notwithstanding their utmost efforts , And shall send the Transports loaded .

		ー The Rebels stole into the Town in the Night and next Morning sent a party down to
Brentons Neck	LOCATION	where we had been taking off Stock , and what we left such as Milch Cows for the use of the Family , they took all away , not leaving a Chicken for the Women .

		I sent to the Town and acquainted them they must get the Rebels away , or otherwise it would become my Duty to destroy them and the Town , they gave me the strongest Assurances they should leave the
Town	ORGANIZATION	and actually did leave it after staying one Night and part of the next day , And quartered themselves two Miles distant , in this Instance it would have been hard upon the Town to have destroyed it , because it seemed that many of them could not help the Irruption of such a Banditti .

		Such numbers being sent from
Camp	ORGANIZATION	and Country round about , and talking of making
Newport	LOCATION	a place of Arms by Fortifying it , and pretending to have brought 17 Pieces of Cannon from
Camp	LOCATION	, for that purpose , in Order to divert their attention , I got under Weigh with His Majesty 's Ships , and stood up towards
Bristol	LOCATION	, came to an Anchor against it a little after 6 PM sent an Officer to Summon it to know if they would send any body to treat , gave them an hour to consider , and if they sent no answer in that time to Commence Hostilities , they Slighted our Summons , they returned no answer !

		this , together with their behaviour about a Month before -LRB- Bargaining for a quantity of Cattle of a Farmer opposite the Town , the people of the Town rose and drove away all my Cattle -RRB- determined me to fire upon them .

		At 8 oClock we begun , at 10 a Mr
Potter	PERSON	came on board to Treat , he did not seem to have full powers , so desired some may be sent off that had , I asked them why they did not answer my Summons , that my intentions was friendly , that I only came to purchase Stock for the King 's forces .

		ー Had they given me fair Answers not a Gun would have been fired , however , since it was as it was , I demanded a quantity of Stock for the use of His Majesty , which I would pay for , ー They hesitated and prevaricated much , said the Country people had drove it all off ー I told them that would not do ー they then told me they could get about 50 Sheep .

		ー the Country being at this time greatly alarmed , Rebels flocking in from all quarters , ー My intent being answer 'd diverting them from making a place of Arms of
Newport	LOCATION	, ー Accepted of the 50 Sheep and got them onboard .

		During this transaction the Rebels fired several Shot at us In the Evening weighed and came to Sail , Anchored off
Hogg Island	LOCATION	, Next morning Ordered the Swan and two Tenders in to destroy
Bristol Ferries	ORGANIZATION	, they made a Signal for a large Body of Rebels being there , stood in and fired a few Shot at them .

		One of our Tenders got aground , continued plying off and on , as we Tack 'd being close in upon the Shore , the Swan ran aboard of us carried away our Jibboom and hurt the knee of the head we let go the Anchor , parted the Cable and run ashore , while we were in this situation we exchanged several Shot with the Rebels , The Water rising we got off after being two hours ashore , without any damage -LRB- we have now only three Cables in the Ship . -RRB-

		Weighed and Stood to some of the other
Islands	LOCATION	, Compleated the Transports and returned to
Newport	LOCATION	.

		Upon my Arrival several Gentlemen of the Town waited upon me , from the Town , acquainting me if I would spare the Town , and suffer the Ferry Boats and Markets to come to
Town	ORGANIZATION	, they would engage to get the Rebels off the
Island	LOCATION	and Supply His Majesty 's Ships with what they wanted , I answered it would be impossible to be at Peace while such a Body of Rebels hung over the Town if they would remove them off the Island and Supply the Kings Ships , I would consent to what they proposed 'till further Orders .

		This appears to me to be for the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	and I am yet of Opinion it may be made a Post for the King .

		Most of the Wood used here comes from
Long Island	LOCATION	we take Vessels loaded , that 's precarious , two or three Companies of Men as guards , while others cut , may get much .

		Rebel Vessels broke up will make more ー In regard to Provisions , there 's plenty to be got but it requires some force to protect while others get it , there 's not an Island about here that has not 2 or 300 Men under Arms to defend the Stock , and they are very vigilant , some of them have Marched 50 Miles upon an Alarm .

		A Deputation from the Town informs me the Officer commanding the
Rebel Party	ORGANIZATION	that is about two Miles from the Town , demurs upon leaving the Island but promises not to come near the Town ー I still insist upon their leaving the Island , ー in consequence they have sent off to the Rebel Head Quarters to insist upon their being removed , and I am flattered if that should be refused , there 's a number of them will take Arms to join any force may be sent to drive them off .

		They seem to think it hard they should be drove to draw the resentment of the whole Continent upon them , when there is none to give them Assistance .

		ー however there is so much deceit in this Country and of which you are well acquainted that I need say no more upon that Subject .

		You will see by the State and Condition of His Majesty 's Ships the situation we are in for Provisions , we have had no regular Supply from the Contractor these four Months past , and he has declined having any thing to do with it , so if we do n't settle some terms with the Town , we must depend upon ravaging the Country for Supplies .

		I have the honor to be -LSB- & c. -RSB-

Ticonderoga Octr	PERSON	14th 1775 Sir I had just closed my Letter of yesterday when I had the Honor to receive Yours of the 9th enclosing the Resolution of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the 14th Septr , and the alarming Intelligence contained in Yours of the 7th 2 ー You may recollect Sir , that early after the Meeting of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	I urged the Necessity of Securing
Hudson 's River	LOCATION	, & assigned my Reasons for It .

		ー 3 I have been & still am so deeply impressed with the Necessity of doing it , that I saw with
Chagrin	PERSON	, that It has been so long neglected ; and I learnt with Pleasure , that a Fortification was at last began at
Martlers Rock	LOCATION	, but that is not the only Place , that ought to be secured , there are several Others both above and below , that ought equally to claim Attention , and immediately too , for should a Body of Forces be sent up
Hudsons River	LOCATION	and a Chain of Vessels stationed in all its Extent , It will undoubtedly greatly distress , if not totally ruin our Cause ; The Indians Notwithstanding their Declarations will , in such a Case , in all Probability act against us .

		ー the disaffected to our Cause will gain Strength , And many others thro ' fear and the Principle of Self preservation , will either be neuter or join our foes , ー to me Sir Every Object , as to Importance , sinks almost to Nothing , when put in Competition with this of securing
Hudson 's River	LOCATION	.

		ー I hope
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will pardon the Freedom with which I express Myself on this Occasion , The Danger of such an Operation on the Part of the Ministry is painted in such lively Colours on my Mind , That I could not avoid saying what I have done ... I have not heard a Word from
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	since mine of yesterday , I am still in Hopes all will go well there , unless a Want of Ammunition takes Place .

		The
New York Congress	ORGANIZATION	have wrote to
Connecticut	LOCATION	What the Result of their Application is , I do not yet know .

		I should be extreamly happy if your good Wishes -LRB- on which I return You the most unfeigned Thanks -RRB- for the Restoration of my Health were realized , but unfortunately for me , I am so daily weakening by a Violent Lax & extreme Sweatings at Night , that I shall think it necessary to send for Dr -LSB-

Army	ORGANIZATION	under General
Montgomery	PERSON	-LRB- from which I can not dissuade him , nor dare I order him tostay least the Regiment should refuse to go , which he says they would do -RRB- , I thought it my Indispensable Duty to write him a Letter of which the inclosed is a Copy , and to which I received an Answer , Copy of which you have also inclosed .

		ー I have since received Letters adviseing me that he has presumed to discharge Men of -LSB-
Benjamin -RSB- Hinman	PERSON	's & -LSB-
David -RSB- Waterbery	PERSON	's Regiments .

		I assure you Sir , that I feel these Insults from a General Officer with all that keen Sensibility that a Man of Honor ought , and I should be ashamed to mention them to

Newport	LOCATION	,
Bristol	LOCATION	, & c.
Receive Daily Insults	ORGANIZATION	from
Naval Force	ORGANIZATION	, which has been Augmented within these few Days to fifteen sail ; after they arrived they began soon to Demand Stock from the neighbo -LSB- u -RSB- ring Towns , at
Bristol	LOCATION	in Particular , and in Consequence of their not Satisfying a Demand for three or four Hundred Sheep , & c. the Town was fired upon from the Ships under the Command of Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	, which were arrayed front of the Town , for two or three Hours ; finally an Inhabitant , by hailing , had Admittance on Board , who , to stop their Infernal Cruelty , Promised and Delivered them forty S -LSB- h -RSB- eep ; the Firing then Ceased ; Three Geese only fell Victims to
Wallace	PERSON	's
Despotic Power	ORGANIZATION	with all his Thunder Bolts , Damaged but few Houses .

		Two large Row Gallies have within these few Days been launched in this Town , one Seventy odd , and the other 80 odd Keel , carrying between Thirty and Forty Oars each .

		It is hoped the plans these kind of Vessels are made to execute will be gloriously succeeded , as the Enemy by Water have it in their Power to do us far greater Mischief than those by Land at present ... Providence , Oct 15th 1775 .

SAMUEL BAYARD	PERSON	AND
WILLIAM BEDLOW	PERSON	TO NATHANIEL WOODHULL Sir .


Martler	PERSON	's Rock , Oct. 15th , 1775 .

		Since we have had cannon mounted and colours hoisted on this fortification , we thought it necessary for every vessel passing by in the daytime , instead of sending their boat on shore , to hale them to lower the peak of their mainsail , as a token of their being friendly .

		We are now to acquaint you , that one Captain
Robert North	PERSON	, passing by on this day , was hailed to lower his peak , which he refused to do .

		On being threatened with a shot , he replied , that was what he wanted ; on this we sent an armed boat on board of him to bring him too , in order to Enquire his reason for refusing to do the same which he that instant saw another sloop to do ; on our boats boarding of him , he told the people therein that he had a brace of pistols , and if that damned rascal -LRB- Capt.
Bayard	PERSON	-RRB- did not produce an order to him from the Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for the request we made , he would blow his brains out , with many more unfriendly expressions .

		We beg , sir , you will lay the above before the Honourable Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and if our conduct herein meet with their approbation , you 'll will please to signify the same unto us .

		We are , with respect , sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB-

SILAS DEANE	PERSON	TO THOMAS MUMFORD -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, Octo 15th , 1775 .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	have also appointed a
Secret Committee for Supplying the Continent	ORGANIZATION	with certain Necessary Articles ; of this I am one , and wish I could see you , or some other of my
Connecticut Mercantile Friends	ORGANIZATION	, here , as it would be in my power , to help them , & in theirs to serve their Country , this -LSB- is -RSB- all I can give , on this head , & if you will come down , the Sooner , the better .

		A
Naval Force	ORGANIZATION	, is a Favorite object of mine , & I have a prospect now , of carrying that point , having succeeded in getting Our
Connecticut	LOCATION	, & the
Rhode Island Vessels	LOCATION	into
Continental	ORGANIZATION	pay ; which motion I was seconded in beyond any expectations , and was further directed by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to lay before them an Estimate of the Cruisers on this coast .

		This I shall lay before them this Day , and am of your Opinion , that
N. London	PERSON	harbor is well situated for the rendezvous of an
American Navy	ORGANIZATION	; & , my Friend , is it not worth while , for
N. London	PERSON	to labor , to obtain the advantages of such a Collection of Navigation spending their Money there ?

		I think it prudent & adviseable , therefore , for you or some other to come instantly down here , by which you may undoubtedly procure an advantageous employment for your Navigation .

		P.S. Where is the Maccaroni , & how have you succeeded in procuring a most Necessary Article ?

EDMUND PENDLETON	PERSON	TO
RICHARD HENRY	PERSON	LEE Dear Sir ー
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, October 15 , 1775 .

		I have by express , your obliging favour of the 5th ; we were in some sort , prepared for the disagreeable intelligence of the small hopes of an accomodation , by reports and papers here intimating the same thing .

		Colonel -LSB-
Richard -RSB- Corbin	PERSON	has a letter from a hand connected in some manner with
Admon	PERSON	, that the plan was to withdraw all troops , and send men of war and cutters , to put a stop to all foreign trade , and that with each other , and so starve us into submission .

		If this is the case , perhaps -LSB-
Molyneux	PERSON	-RSB-
Shuldham	LOCATION	may not bring troops .

		Our affairs may perhaps take another turn , when the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	petition and the
Virginia	LOCATION	representation against Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, reaches the people there .

		These furious measures seem to have been suddenly adopted on the arrival of
Lady Dunmore	PERSON	, no doubt with cargoes of aggravating letters and misrepresentation from our hero , and just after some fears of Admon respecting the Spaniards , were quieted by their loss among the
Algerines	LOCATION	; whatever be our state , I hope we shall meet it with fortitude .

		Had we arms and ammunition , it would give vigour to our measures .

		We hourly hoped to hear of the arrival of the necessaries , but now fear we shall be defeated .

		A villain has given Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	information of it , and he has six or seven tenders plying out for it about the capes .

		What can such a parricide deserve ?

		We have been sitting a month , and yet see no hopes of a recess ; we are thin , and some present unwell .

		Colonel
Thomas	PERSON	is among the healthy .

		Nine companies of regulars are here , and seem very clever men ; others we hear are ready , and only wait to collect arms .

		Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	's forces are only one hundred and sixty as yet , entrenched at
Gosport	LOCATION	, and supported by the ships drawn up before that and
Norfolk	LOCATION	.

		I have heard of no attempt of his since seizing the printer , and a ship with flour , from
Baltimore	LOCATION	, except sending a party to Sleepy Hole , in pursuit of some powder we had there , which he missed about three hours .

		Most of the inhabitants of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, except tories , have moved out their families and valuable effects .

		Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, it is said , is much afraid of the riflemen , and has all his vessels caulked up on the sides , above men 's height , however , they may perhaps pay him a visit , ere long .

		The good news relative to General
Schuyler	PERSON	, came as a reviving cordial after the other ; nothing has yet happened more important in my opinion , than this event , if completed , as I hope it is before now .

		Pray present my affectionate compliments to your worthy brethren and the ladies .

		I am , with great regard , -LSB- & c. -RSB- Edmd .

ALEXANDER INNES	PERSON	TO PATRICK TONYN -LSB- Extract -RSB- Cherokee in Rebellion Road 15th Octr 1775 Sir , I did myself the honor to write to your Excellency by
Colo.	LOCATION	.

		Kirkland some time ago ; and at the same time sent all the packets that came by the two preceding Mails .

		I now convey to your Excellency those brought by Pond , & am at the same time to beg a thousand pardons for the liberty I took in opening your News papers , as by some neglect Lord
Williams	PERSON	2 were not sent and in our present forelorn situation you may judge how anxious we must be to read any thing from
England	LOCATION	.

		It was Committee like freedom , but we do n't stick at higher Crimes then felony or breach of trust in this Province 3 ー The Governor has left me very little interesting to say of affairs here , there are great divisions amongst the Leaders , & I firmly believe the majority of the people of
Charles Town	LOCATION	are against all their measures ... The 2d of July Capt Tollemache sailed from this harbour for
Boston	LOCATION	, perfectly well informed of the state of this & the neighbouring
Provinces of N. Carolina & Georgia	ORGANIZATION	with the strongest remonstrances from the three Governors both to Gen.
Gage	PERSON	& the Admiral ; and so little regard has been paid to them , that not even a line has been received from either ... The Cherokee is a great acquisition to us ,
Cap	PERSON	.


Ferguson	PERSON	with good sense , politeness , and skill in his profession has the warmest zeal for the good of the Service : he is none of those luke warm officers with which we have long been cursed , and we have only to regret his force is so unequal to his spirit .


De Brahm	PERSON	4 who he brought out has been plaguing us with his being impeded in carrying on the service he was order 'd , but the Governor -LRB- who has moved from the
Tamer	LOCATION	to this ship -RRB- has cut him very short .

		A fine time to talk of his surveys of a Country that we are in a doubt to whom it may belong ー I shall be happy on every occasion to receive your commands , & am with the most perfect Esteem & respect Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB- Alex.
Innes	PERSON	N B I take the Liberty of inclosing under your Excellency 's Cover a few lines to Mr -LSB-
James -RSB- Penman	PERSON	to request his good offices to this poor skipper .

		His Excellency Governor
Tonyn	PERSON	I will not trouble your Excellency with Mr

De Brahm	PERSON	, Surveyor General of His Majesty 's American dominions in the

Charleston	LOCATION	in the Cherokee , which , by order issued April 6 , 1775 , had been fitted out for this purpose .


ALEXANDER INNES	PERSON	TO
JAMES PENMAN	PERSON	Cherokee Arm 'd Ship in Rebellion Road 15th Octr 75 Dear
Penman	PERSON	I wrote you a long letter some time ago by the post , & a very few days after , because I did not chuse to be disarmed by a couple of rascals sent by the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, a Letter de Cachet was issued by that august body and signed by your old friend
Peter Timothy	PERSON	, by which I was order 'd to quit the Province in 24 hours , the time was enlarged to four days , & I took refuge under the wings of old Thornborough in the Tamer .

		The Governor was soon obliged to follow me , leaving a clear stage for your friend -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Laurens	PERSON	, & his Associates .

		The day after I went on board the Tamer , arrived the Cherokee commanded by Lieutenant
Ferguson	PERSON	a noble spirited fine fellow .

		He brought out that old F--k Beggar De B -- m for survey , 2 who wanted to get away when he found how things were , but avast hawling that rope Thornborough gave an order to Mr
Ferguson	PERSON	to remain , against which De B. protested , & finding that would not do , he trusted to his connexions with some of the most violent rebels
Edwards	PERSON	& Mr
Parker	PERSON	, got leave from the Commee and landed his effects & suite : he had before offered his apartments to the Governor , which he now accepted , and fairly took possession , to the great mortification of
De B.	PERSON	who had the assurance yesterday to write to the Governor he should again come on board , and turn him .

		out for that was the plain English of it , & received aproper answer .

		We know but little what is doing in Town , they are much divided amongst themselves , & had we a respectable force here , we could soon alter things , but these Provinces are much neglected .

		You would see Mr
Kirkland	PERSON	to whom I refer 'd you for all news .

		I was so busy the morning he went off , with our English Dispatches , it was not in my power to write by him .

Oliver	PERSON	now

		For Gods sake dont let pique , or passion lead you to abet a set of as worthless miscreants as ever existed , but I beg your pardon I am saying two much when I know so Little , therefore shall only add whatever your politlcal Tenets are I never can be less your Affect .

		The Men of war would not take the advantage of his misfortunes , but as we did not love the people of
Charles Town	LOCATION	well enough to send them apples , we thought of our E.
Florida	LOCATION	friends , and the Governor has desired me to recommend him to your good Offices as a Merchant .

		The poor man means to winter with you , & pick up a few pence along shore in his Little Bark if he can .

		His escape was a most providential one .

		He will tell you his own story and give you all the news to the Northward his name is
John Wan	PERSON	ton of the Sloop Polly & I pray God we may get him clear of this harbour .

		Hitherto he has had no communication with the Town .

		Your Letter in ansr to mine of April the 6th I have not recd , hence You may naturaly conceive me very unhappy concerning you and
Mrs Fanueil	PERSON	but am now releived and happy to learn you had determined on going to winter in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	because you will certainly be in safety there .

		the Admiral can never Suffer the Colonists to cross the
Bay Fundy	LOCATION	and Seize that Province nor can Public affairs Continue to be conducted as they have been hitherto .

		from the little knowledge I have of
America	LOCATION	, and of
Millitary Operations	ORGANIZATION	, I do conceive General
Gage	PERSON	can not Winter at
Boston	LOCATION	and that ere this he will have determined to quit it because Should it remain longer undetermined it may not be in His Power to Quit
Boston	LOCATION	without quiting
America	LOCATION	, my meaning is that he cant Winter all his Troops at
Halifax	LOCATION	therefore Part of them must come to
Quebec	LOCATION	and it is Necessary to that end they should now be Embark 'd or they will not get up the
River	LOCATION	, the Hunter Sloop of war is arrived at

Quitting America	LOCATION	next Spring and with the fragments of your Fortune purchasing an Annuity for Your and

Kingdom of Great Britain	LOCATION	can not much longer be Governd by such weak Councils and feable Efforts , she has scarcely got a secure Province in

Nova Scotia Stands	LOCATION	much indebted to W & R and I should be happy to have it in my power , as it is my wish , to Visit it before my return to

		OFFICERS OF THE EASTERN REGIMENT , LINCOLN COUNTY , TO THE

General Court of the Colony	ORGANIZATION	of the Massachusetts-bay now sitting at
Watertown	LOCATION	The Officers of the Eastern regiment of Militia in the County of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	, in a
Council	ORGANIZATION	at
Boothbay	LOCATION	in said County met , October 16th 1775 Most humbly shew , That at the beginning of the present war the townstocks of ammunition within their bounds were very insignificant ; and many able & spirited men in the regiment were destitute of effective fire arms .

		That every means possible in their circumstances have been tried to remedy these defects ー and tried in vain .

		That the frequent alarms , & consequent general musters of this regiment , arising from the restless attempts of our unnatural enemies , to which the busy & extensive sea-coast within our bounds , peculiarly exposes the inhabitants of this County , & especially the Eastern part of it , occasions a greater waste of ammunition here than in most places distant from the camp ; & unavoidably produces a constant demand for it .

		That , the appearance of a fleet in this harbour -LRB- which after three days stay , and various amusing movements , has magnified its valour by the burning of one dwelling-house ー & carrying off about one hundred sheep ー and this morning disappeared -RRB- has called out to use all the ammunition , which had not gone off with Col.
-LSB- James -RSB- Cargill	PERSON	to Long island .

		That the Expedition under Col.
Cargill	PERSON	is like to spend alithe Ammunition he has taken ; and if so , this Regiment is like to be left destitute of an article without which this much endangered coast can never be defended ; and with which tho ' chearfully ready to lay down the price , they see no way to supply themselves .

		That the Schooner Britannia of , & for Newbury-port , Wm.
Pierce Johnson	PERSON	, Master , arrived here yesterday , with a quantity of powder & arms from the
West Indies	LOCATION	; on the Account of the late Comee of Supplies of this Colony : That the conveyance of said stores will be very hazardous while this coast continues to be harrassed as at present by the foe .

		That , the inhabitants being ready chearfully to pay for what arms and ammunition may be supplied them , & as ready to use both in the defence of
American Liberty	ORGANIZATION	, tho ' even their lives be expended with them ; Your petitioners pray that such part of the said cargo as to your Honor 's may seem meet may be ordered to be delivered to Col.
Cargill	PERSON	, for the use of the Militia of his regiment , they paying him for the same , & your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray .

William Pierce Johnson	PERSON	Master having on board a quantity of arms & ammunition which he sais is for the province Use , The great necessity there is for ammunition & arms in this County & the daily alarms we have had & are still subject too induces me to desire that some part of the ammunition that is on board the Schooner may be delivered to some suitable person for the use of the Companies stationed on the

Coln Cargill	PERSON	is now absent -RRB- humbly pray , that some of the ammunition may be left in this County for the use beforementioned , also that Capt

		LETTER FROM REV.
JACOB BAILEY	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB-
Falmouth	LOCATION	, October 16 . -RSB-

		On Monday morning , about nine , the same number of shipping appeared in the offing , and seemed by their motions approaching the harbour , the wind still continuing to blow hard from the north-west .

		About eleven we perceived them within
Cape Elizabeth	PERSON	, and spreading all their canvass to secure the harbour , and at three they had beat up to
Hog Island	LOCATION	and came to anchor , almost a league from the town .

		Soon after their coming to an anchor , we observed the barge from the Commodore rowing in pursuit of a small schooner , which , notwithstanding the discharge of several muskets and two cannon , escaped in safety to the town .

		The populace which were gazing by hundreds were immediately thrown into furious agitation by this incident , and vowed revenge with the utmost menace and caution .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, composed of tradesmen and persons of no property , prompted only for a flaming zeal for the liberty of their country , were not less enraged at this hostile appearance , and , to display their wisdom and courage , they ordered the company of guards to take possession , who in obedience to these instructions , stole safely down in the close of the evening to secure the cattle , to intimidate the tories and to observe the motions of the enemy .

		After so many premeditated Attacks on the legal Prerogatives of the best of Sovereigns After the repeated Instances you have experienced in
Britain	LOCATION	's long forbearance of the
Rod	PERSON	of Correction ; and the Merciful and Paternal extension of her Hands to embrace you , again and again , have been regarded as vain and nugatory .

		And in place of a dutiful and grateful return to your King and Parent state ; you have been guilty of the most unpardonable Rebellion , supported by the Ambition of a set of designing men , whose insidious crews have cruelly imposed on the credulity of their fellow creatures , and at last have brought the whole into the same Dilemma ; which leads me to feel not a little for the Innocent of them , in particular on the present occasion , having it in orders to execute a just Punishment on the Town of
Falmouth	LOCATION	: In the name of which
Authority	ORGANIZATION	I previously warn you to remove without delay the Human Species out of the said town ; for which purpose I give you the time of two hours , at the period of which , a Red pendant will be hoisted at the

Newport	LOCATION	, October 16 .

		Last Monday -LSB- October 9 -RSB- the men of war , after firing on
Bristol	LOCATION	and Papaquash , went into the ferry way between
Portsmouth	LOCATION	and
Bristol	LOCATION	, and fired near 200 shot at the houses and people on each side ; 3 shot struck the house of Capt.
Earl	PERSON	near the ferry , which is all the damage done there that we hear of ; 60 shot , we hear , were fired at the windmill , without hitting it .

		From thence some of the ships , tenders and transports , went and surrounded Gould-Island and took a few sheep ; others went to
Hope Island	LOCATION	, and got 2 or 3 young cattle ; thence they proceeded to
Dutch-Island	LOCATION	, in
Narragansett-Bay	LOCATION	; where were upwards of 100 rams , part of which some people from
Narragansett	PERSON	took off , while the vessels lay there ; the remainder , about 60 , the enemy took away .

		On the whole this fleet , by cruising and firing about our bays and harbours , for near a fortnight , have got about 40 head of cattle great and small , and 180 sheep , including the cattle bought of the Brentons , and 60 rams ; the 150 sheep mentioned in many papers of last Monday being a mistake ; for we are well informed they got but 5 sheep from
Brenton	PERSON	's neck .

		The same day the
Glasgow	LOCATION	fired a number of cannon upon the town of
Jamestown	LOCATION	, without doing any damage , except beating one stone out of a house .

		The men of war , tenders , & c. came down the bay and anchored in this harbour , last Thursday .

		Within 14 days past the men of war have taken out , and cut away , the masts , bowsprits , & c. of a number of small sloops and ferry boats .

		Last Friday in the afternoon a barge , with a number of hands from one of the ships in this harbour , landed at the N.W. part of this town , took a boat which lay haled up on the shore , and was carrying her off , when the owner got his musket , ran down to the shore , and fired upon the barge , but did no execution ; upon which the
Glasgow	LOCATION	, and one of the tenders , fired several shot at the owner of said boat , but missed him .

		ー A 9 pound shot , from the
Glasgow	LOCATION	, entered one side of Mr.
Matthew Lawton	PERSON	's house on the Point , carried away a part of a beam inside , and fell down , without hurting any person .

		As soon as time will permit , we shall view the place recommended , more strictly than we have had any opportunity to do .

		At present , the engineer informs us , he can not give an estimate of the charge of a further work that may be necessary at
Pooploop	LOCATION	's Kill .

		We shall exert ourselves in forwarding the work carrying on here , and every other order the Provincial

		We beg leave to request you will communicate this with the enclosed , unto the Honble .

		REMARKS BY
BERNARD	PERSON	ROMANS Highlands , October 16th , 1775 .

		If it be considered that the season when this work was undertaken was very far advanced , I think that we are in as forward a situation as can be wished for , and I make no doubt but the work begun will in three weeks time be of sufficient strength to stand the brunt of as large a ship of rank as can come here , and two or three small fry .

		Heavy cannon , such as of 18 , 24 and 32 lb .

		seem to be all that is wanted .

		I think on Saturday next -LSB- October 21 -RSB- to be able to mount from 12 to 18 cannon , 8 of which at least might be heavy ones .

		We are in a miserable timber country , even fascines are with more difficulty got than stones ; of the last we have such plenty that in four days 150 perches of wall has been properly laid by 12 masons .

		We want more workmen , especially masons , and our -LSB- men -RSB- require a regulation prescribed to them , which it seems impossible to bring them under , until they be properly officered and distributed , each division having its proper department allotted .

		It is not only the difficulty of getting timber , but we have fully experienced that the part of the work which is done in timber advances slower than the stone , by a degree beyond all comparison .

		A battery at
Moore	PERSON	's house seems , at present , to me entirely useless .

		I will examine further into this article .

		The point on the west side above
Verplanck	LOCATION	's point , is too easy of access , and in the vicinity of many ill disposed people ; besides this , it can be of little use .

		But at
Pooploop	LOCATION	's kill , opposite to
Anthony	PERSON	's nose , it is a very important pass ; the river narrow , commanded a great ways up and down , full of counter currents , and subject to almost constant fall winds ; nor is there any anchorage at all , except close under the works to be erected .

		It is a very easy matter to establish posts for intelligence with the upper country and
Connecticut	LOCATION	; for the last I intend to go in person , in about two or three weeks time .

		With those in the Jerseys I am not so perfectly acquainted , but if the country people are well affected , I know the roads admit of the most expeditious intelligence , and of our receiving the readiest assistance .

		I understand that it will be an easy matter to obstruct the navigation of the river , so as to confine it to 12 or 14 feet ; and in that case it remains large enough for our use , and without new inventions and constructions the enemy can then do us very little hurt .

		B. Romans , Engineer .

JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- Extract -RSB- No Carolina Cruizer Sloop of War , in Cape Fear River Octr 16th 1775 .

		Your Lordship may depend I will not fail in the strictest observance of His Majesty 's commands to exert every endeavour , and to employ every means that shall be in my power to aid and support General
Gage	PERSON	and Admiral Graves in all such operations , as they may think proper to undertake for carrying The King 's orders into full execution , and restoring the authority of His Majesty 's Government .

		at the same time , I grieve to be obliged to acknowledge to Your Lordship , that I have not the least power at present to assist their operations .

		Mr
Samuel Johnston	PERSON	having summoned and convened the late
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Hillsborough	LOCATION	and presided therein ; and having also accepted the Office of Treasurer of the northern District of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	under the appointment of this unconstitutional
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, of his own creation , in open violation of an Act of the
Provincial Legislature	ORGANIZATION	, by which Treasurers are appointed , and actually existing , I have thought it high time , and indispensibly my duty to supersede him as Deputy Naval Officer of this Province , 2 and I have accordingly appointed Mr
Archibald Neilson	PERSON	, a Gentleman well qualified by his knowledge , integrity , and good principles , to act in that
Office	ORGANIZATION	until His Majesty 's Pleasure shall be known he is indeed the only capable person , that in my present state cut off from all intercourse with the Country , I can appoint , or with whom I can communicate upon the subject .

		I do not think however , that I could , at any time , make a better choice in this Province , It is possible also that the resentment of Mr
John Ashe	PERSON	, occasioned by his disappointment of the chief command of the military establishment formed by the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	will cause some division here : for it seems he and his friends are raising men of their own authority in opposition to Mr
James Moore	PERSON	, his brother in law , who is appointed Military Chief under the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		In cases of seizures made by The
King	ORGANIZATION	's Ships it is to be apprehended , it will be very difficult , if not impracticable to form Courts of Vice Admiralty for their Tryal in this Province , as well as in other of the Colonies for want of communication with the proper Officers .

		in that event Your Lordship knows that Officers of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	will be exposed to prosecutions , for detaining , beyond a short limitation of time , Vessels they may seize under the late Act of Parliament restraining the Trade of some of the Colonies , which are thereby directed to be tried , as other seizures , in the Courts of Admiralty ; unless in these special cases , and when the proceedings of such Courts shall be opposed , and obstructed , as will probably happen , some provision is made by law for their indemnification .

		Mr.
Alexander McGregor	PERSON	late Master of the Snow Relief , stranded here in the month of March last , gave me about a fortnight ago a detail of Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Collet	PERSON	's proceedings with regard to his Cargo upon which he laid in claim as a Salvager .

		and by this man 's account , as well as from other circumstances that have come to my knowledge , I am bound to conclude that Mr
Collet	PERSON	's conduct on the occasion was exceedingly injurious , and unjustifiable .

		I recommended to Captain
Collet	PERSON	, on his first report of the case to me at
New Bern	LOCATION	, to take The Attorney General 's opinion and advice for his rule and guide , and to be governed by them minutely , or he would certainly subject himself to prosecution , and very probably to great damages .

		he accordingly did advise with The Attorney General , I am informed , but followed nevertheless his own judgment ; which by the representations of Mr
McGregor	PERSON	, I fear was formed more upon views to his own gain and interest , than upon any principles of justice , equity , and charity ; all of which the nature of the case ought to have excited in the strongest manner .

		I much lament My Lord that I have so much reason in this affair , and on other accounts to alter my favorable sentiments of Captain
Collet	PERSON	, of whom , and of his principles , I was wont to think highly .

		In a
North Carolina	LOCATION	Gazette of the 29th of September , Your Lordship will see a most pompous display of Discoveries of military stores in and about my house at
New Bern	LOCATION	, almost every article of which the Author of this abuse , I am persuaded , well knows to be old stores , deposited there by Governor
Tryon	PERSON	after his expedition against the Regulators , which it seems , my Servants , in their abundant caution , had buried , as described in the News Papers , to keep them out of the hands of the Mob .

		of mine , or of my provision , there was nothing among them , but two kegs containing between forty and fifty pounds of Gunpowder -LRB- called quarter casks in the News Paper -RRB- which I had bought , and intended for saluting The King 's last birthday and which on my previous , and necessary departure from
New Bern	LOCATION	, I directed to be put away in some place of Security .

GEORGE JAMES BRUERE	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH My Lord Bermuda	ORGANIZATION	16 of October 1775 Captain
Tollemache	PERSON	of the Scorpion Man of War , having very fortunately for us , touched at
Bermuda	LOCATION	, and came into
St Georges Harbour	LOCATION	, at the East end of tl ; iese
Islands	LOCATION	, with a large transport with Him both intended for
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		Some days after his arrival , an american armed vessel , came to anchor at the west End far out of His reach or access , and spoke with the land we are informed , and then went off .

		And We are very apprehensive , that She came for the Cannon that they might know to be in Store here .

		And to prevent any such design , as Captain Tollemache intended , and was obliged to proceed for
Carolina	LOCATION	, the first fair wind .

		and we should then be left defenceless ; we were both of opinion , that it was much the best way for Captain
Tollemache	PERSON	to take charge of the
Cannon in Store	ORGANIZATION	, and put them on board His Tender or large Transport , to prevent the said
Cannon	ORGANIZATION	to be Carried off , in the same maner as the powder was , and applyed against His Majestys army .

		We have delivered to Him thirty peices of Iron ordnance with the Carriages and stores , belonging to them & c which I doubt not but His Majesty and Your Lordship will approve of .


Jonathan Burch	PERSON	Esqr His Majestys Chief Justice in
Bermuda	LOCATION	, is the most worthy , to be recommended to His Majestys favor , for His Attention and good will to the
King 's Service	ORGANIZATION	, at this particular time of trouble and danger : He hath no Salary , and hath laboured in that imployment many years for nothing .

		I have the Honor to be -LSB- & c. -RSB-
George Ja	PERSON	s

		LETTER FROM REV.
JACOB BAILEY	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB-
Falmouth	LOCATION	, October 17 . -RSB-

		All however remained in profound peace and tranquility till eleven o'clock the next morning , when the sternmost ship got under sail and the rest in succession .

		It was half after two before the Commodore weighed anchor , when the whole fleet stood directly up the river , and formed in line of battle before the town .

		We now plainly discovered one ship of twenty guns , one of sixteen , a large schooner of fourteen , a bomb sloop and two other armed vessels .

		The Commodore , who proved to be Capt.
Mowatt	PERSON	, had no sooner come to anchor and handed his sails , than he fitted out his barge , in which he dispatched an officer on shore , with a letter directed to the inhabitants of
Falmouth	LOCATION	.

		He landed at the lower end of King street , amid a prodigious assembly of people , which curiosity and expectation had drawn together from every quarter .

		Some of the multitude appeared in arms , who united with the rest to convey the officer with uncommon parade and ceremony along the street to the
Town House	ORGANIZATION	.

		His entrance was immediately followed by a confused mixture , which filled the apartment with noise and tumult At length the officer being seated with the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	; who took possession of the Judge 's seat , and silence commanded , a letter was delivered and read by Mr. -LSB-
John -RSB- Bradbury	PERSON	, a lawyer , but not without such a visible emotion as occasioned a tremor of his voice .

		It is impossible to describe the amazement which prevailed upon reading this alarming declaration : a frightful consternation ran through the assembly , every heart was seized with terror , every countenance changed colour ; and a profound silence ensued for several moments .

		During the astonishment which had seized the multitude , I quitted the apartment of justice and became a spectator of what passed in the street , where nothing occurred but scenes of tumult , confusion , and bustle .

		A number of considerate gentlemen , however , made choice of a committee , viz : , Brigadier -LSB-
Jedediah -RSB- Preble	PERSON	, Dr.
-LSB- Nathaniel -RSB- Coffin	PERSON	, and Mr.
Pagan	PERSON	, to wait upon the Commodore .

		He received them with expressions of humanity , and even shed tears at the repetition of his orders .

		At the earnest entreaty of these gentlemen , he consented to suspend execution till sunrise , upon condition that the people would agree to deliver up a number of their arms .

		Upon the return of this committee the inhabitants assembled in the
Court House	ORGANIZATION	, and readily complied with the requisition .

		The arms being delivered to the Commodore about eight , he granted them a further respite till nine the next morning , and besides , engaged that , if the town would surrender their cannon and musketry , and give hostages for their future good behaviour , he , would delay the execution of his orders till he could represent their situation to the Admiral , and intercede for their final deliverance .

		At the same time Capt.
Mowatt	PERSON	assured them that if any person should presume to escape by water during the night , he would immediately fire upon the town .

		When the committee returned the second time , they found the disposition in the people to assemble in the morning , but the zealous sons of liberty dispatched messengers into all the adjacent country and the inhabitants were beating drums , firing alarms , and mustering under arms for thirty miles round .

		Some companies entered
Falmouth	LOCATION	before midnight , and protested that if any compliance or submission was made , they would burn it to ashes .

		And , that no provocation might be offered to
Mowatt	PERSON	by persons of indiscretion a number of moderate gentlemen voluntarily engaged their services to parade the streets , and prevent any disorder that might arise .

		NARRATIVE OF
DANIEL TUCKER	PERSON	OF
FALMOUTH	LOCATION	-LSB-
Falmouth	LOCATION	, October 17 . -RSB-

		He returned again in October with five vessels under his command , two ships , two schooners and one sloop ; they arrived and anchored in the lower harbour on the 16th and laid all night without any communication with the town , and the inhabitants were greatly terrified at the appearance of this hostile fleet , until it was ascertained that Captain
Mowatt	PERSON	commanded the whole ; on the morning of the 17th the fleet got under weigh in a calm and began to warp up toward the town with kedge anchors .

		About 8 oclock A.M. my master -LSB-
Paul	PERSON	-RSB- Little came on horseback to the shop door , called me out , and told me he was going to
Windham	LOCATION	, and to be gone several days , and that he should send people to me with orders to pay for their labor & c. I then asked him if he knew the fleet was coming up , and that people in general were of opinion that it was coming with hostile intentions against the town ; and he replied to me that Captain
Mowatt	PERSON	had the command and there was no danger !

		He went to
Windham	LOCATION	and left me at 15 years of age with the care of both shops .

		The ships and vessels were until four o'clock P.M. before they got to their anchorage before the town , and the inhabitants generally were in a state of alarm , and many began to move out for safety .

		Mrs Little was very much frightened and began to think of moving , and sent me with two old looking glasses out to a place called
Capiseack	PERSON	, when I had deposited the treasure , worth about five dollars !!

		and was about remounting my horse , a Windham man came by on a gallop , and told me the town was to be burned in two hours .

		I told him where Mr.
Little	PERSON	was in
Windham	LOCATION	, and desired him to send him word , and he promised he would but did not .

		I rode into town with all speed , and found Mrs.
Little	PERSON	with her children at the front door , ready to go ; she delivered to me a bag with all her husbands money , books and papers , and with her children walked on to Mr
Deering	PERSON	's farm .

		I then took all the money out of the shops , and all the gold and silver ware , and carried the whole and delivered it to her , and went into town with a charge to save all I could before
Mr Little	PERSON	could get in : and with nobody to help me but the females I got every thing ready to load up carts , in expectation of Mr Littles arrival every minute ; and at nearly midnight he had not arrived , and I was fortunate enough to get a man and horse to go after him at two oclock in the morning .

		This man found
Mr Little	PERSON	in bed and asleep not knowing any thing of the distressed situation of the town .

		When
Mowatt	PERSON	had his fleet moved and ready to fire he sent his barge on shore with an officer under a flag of truce with a long letter to the committee that he had orders to set the town on fire immediately on his arrival ; but he added , that from feelings of humanity he would take it upon himself so far to deviate from his orders as to allow two hours to remove the '' human species . ''

		Immediately upon this official communication being read a respectable committee went on board the Canceaux and entered into a conference with
Mowatt	PERSON	, and with much difficulty prevailed on him to defer his work of destruction till nine o'clock the next morning being the 18th day of October 1775 .


Mowatt	PERSON	having stated to the committee his only condition on which the town could be spared , and that was for the inhabitants to deliver up their arms and swear allegiance to his majesty
King George	PERSON	the third ; this condition being inadmissable the town was sacrificed to the cause of Liberty and Patriotism , as there was no other alternative .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
FRANCIS LEGGE	PERSON	Sir
Preston	PERSON	at
Boston Octr	ORGANIZATION	17 , 1775 Sir I have had the Honour to receive your Excellency 's Letter October 1 .

		The Provisions on board the Victualler at
Halifax	LOCATION	are for the use of the Fleet alone , and had not my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty been extremely provident in timely sending Supplies the
Kings Ships	ORGANIZATION	during the Winter would have been greatly distressed for Victuals ; Your Excellency will therefore perceive I can not consent to any other appropriation of the Provisions upon which we place our sole Dependance for Support ; and that the Transports being sent to
Halifax	LOCATION	was purely for the Convenience of supplying the Ships there .

		The King will undoubtedly be pleased to find such an attention to the
Security of his Naval Yard	ORGANIZATION	and Stores at
Halifax	LOCATION	; I am satisfied your Excellency will readily contribute your utmost to a Service of such importance to his Majs Fleet ; but I fear it is too late to begin even temporary Works , and that the principal Dependance must be on the Kings Ships in
Halifax Harbour	LOCATION	.

		I shall continue a good Force in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, and Ships shall winter at
Annapolis	LOCATION	-LSB- Royal -RSB- and if possible at
Windsor	LOCATION	: By which means the Fears of the well disposed will I hope be removed , and the turbulent and disaffected deterred from attempting what must eventually involve them in destruction .

		There is I fear too much Communication between the Rebels of the Eastern parts of
New England	LOCATION	and the People of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	.

		It would be of singular use to discover a few of the Principals concerned in aiding , abetting or advising the rebellious Proceedings now carrying on in
New England	LOCATION	Governments .

		It is high time to make Examples , in which your Excellency may always depend upon my utmost Assistance .

		What you observe about the Men of War touching at Passamaquody is very proper and shall be attended to .

		I acknowledge the Receipt of your Excellency 's Dispatches to Lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	in one Packet , which shall be transmitted by the first Opportunity .

		Sir , His Excellency Governor

		We flattered ourselves that the sentiments of Respect expressed in Answer to his Excellency 's last Letter to your Worship , and the Assurances that his Information from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	was ill-grounded , would have removed every Suspicion of Injury intended to his Person or Property .

		We can with great Truth assure his Excellency , that we are not apprehensive of the least Danger to his Person or Property ; and that he may rest assured , of all that Protection from us , and our Fellow-Citizens , which will be consistent with the great Principle of our Safety and Preservation : Declaring , at the same Time , that we have the utmost Confidence in his Excellency 's Disposition to serve the true interest of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and that he will , by his wise and prudent Mediation , use his best Offices to restore that Harmony between Great-Britain and the Colonies so ardently wished for by us .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	therefore can not but again express their most earnest Desire that his Excellency would continue his Residence among a People , who have the most grateful sense of his upright and disinterested Administration .

		We have the Pleasure to acquaint your Worship , that the above Letter was unanimously approved of in a full

		A draft of a letter to the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	was read and approved of , and is in the words following , to wit : In Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, New-York , October 17th , 1775 Sir ー We have used all possible despatch to complete the fortifications on
Hudson	LOCATION	's river , and we expect they will be in such forwardness in about six weeks , as to have most of the cannon mounted .

		The commissioners have been directed to make the necessary inquiries respecting the other small batteries , and in the obstructing of the navigation of
Hudson	LOCATION	's river , mentioned by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in their order of the 7th inst .

		to which due attention shall be paid .

		We are of opinion that four companies of matrosses , consisting of at least eighty men each , will be wanted to occupy these forts when completed , and that one company at least should be immediately raised , that we may in time have more properly trained to the use of cannon , as the utility of our fortifications will much depend upon it .

		We are , & c. Ordered , That a copy thereof be engrossed and signed by the President , and ... transmitted .

		Messrs.
John Griffith	PERSON	and
Thomas Vardell	PERSON	, two of the wardens of the port of New-York , delivered in an estimate of the pilot boat named the Bishop of Llandaff , which was read and filed , and is in the words following , to wit : New-York , Oct. 18th -LSB- sic 17th -RSB- 1775 .

Robert North	PERSON	and
Terboss	PERSON	, two of
Hudson	LOCATION	's river skippers , came into

		2 Thereupon a draft of a letter to the said commissioners was read and approved of , and is in the words following , to wit : In Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, New-York , Oct. 17th , 1775 .

		Gentlemen ー We have received complaints from sundry persons , with relation to the conduct of some among you , who have maltreated the commanders and passengers of vessels navigating
Hudson	LOCATION	's river , for not lowering the peak of their mainsail upon passing the fort .

		Those who have been provoked by this demand , complain that you should of your own authority , without the recommendation of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, exact instances of respect from your fellow citizens .

		You must at once be sensible that so trivial a token , or the omission of it , can never mark out our friends from our foes , or answer any other valuable purpose .

		At the same time it is evident that great disgusts have arisen from the peremptory demand , and probably bloodshed may ensue .

		The Colonies have sufficiently suffered through punctilio , and we beg you will desist from exacting marks of submission or respect of any kind , until a plan which is now in agitation shall be completed , which may tend to obviate the future intentions of our foes to pierce into the interior of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, through the natural communication which the river affords ; to prevent this , is the intention of the fortification which you superintend , and therefore all signals from vessels going backwards and forwards should in our opinion be singly -LSB- or simply -RSB- confined to that object , and be by no means used as instances of complaisance to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	or its officers , when the peace and safety of the community so loudly forbid it .

		We are , gentlemen , -LSB- & c. -RSB- By order .

		LETTER FROM REV.
JACOB BAILEY	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB-
Falmouth	LOCATION	, October 18 , -RSB- The morning was calm clear and pleasant , without a breath of wind , and the town was crowded with people and carts from the country to assist in removing the goods and furniture of the inhabitants .

		At exactly half an hour after nine the flag was hoisted at the top of the mast , and the cannon began to roar with incessant and tremendous fury .

		The Commodore , perceiving the streets replete with people , oxen and horses , directed his men to fire over the tops of the houses , but this solemn exhibition struck the multitude into instant alarm and amazement .

		The oxen , terrified at the smoak and report of the guns ran with precipitation over the rocks , dashing every thing in pieces , and scattering large quantities of goods about the streets .

		In a few minutes the whole town was involved in smoak and combustion .

		About a thousand men in arms attended this scene of devastation , besides a prodigious number of both sexes , without attempting any repulsion .

		The bombardment continued from half after nine till sunset , during which all the lower end and middle of the town was reduced to an heap of rubbish .

		Several houses in the back street and in the upper part , together with the church shared the same fate .

		The front of the Meeting house was torn to pieces by the bursting of a bomb , and the buildings which were left standing had their glass windows broken , and both walls and apartments terribly shattered .

		In a word about three quarters of the town was consumed and between two and three hundred families who twenty four hours before enjoyed in tranquility their commodious habitations , were now in many instances destitute of a hut for themselves and families ; and as a tedious winter was approaching they had before them a most gloomy and distressing prospect .

		NARRATIVE OF
DANIEL TUCKER	PERSON	OF
FALMOUTH	LOCATION	-LSB-
Falmouth	LOCATION	, October 18 , -RSB- During the night -LSB- of October 17 -RSB- the people saved all they could .

		About 4 oclock in the morning Mr.
Little	PERSON	got in with two stout teams which we loaded and sent out ; and besides what we thus saved , the tide being up we loaded a gondola at
Porter	PERSON	's wharf with
West India	LOCATION	goods , and sent it around the neck , and then left a great amount of Property to destruction .

		When the time drew near to nine o'clock , and the people generally had gone out of town , Col.
John Waite	PERSON	came by our house and seeing Mr.
Little	PERSON	in the house spoke like one in a fright , and said `` Little !

		it is time to go ; they will fire in a few minutes '' ; his answer was `` I shall go directly ; '' and turning to me he said , ``
Daniel	PERSON	, you had better go . ''

		and I replied , `` I shall go when you do . ''

		We soon started , we went through Federal street and around
Sanfords Corner	LOCATION	through Back street , and when I was almost abreast of the windmill that stood where
Sam Husseys	PERSON	does now ,
Mowatt	PERSON	hoisted a red flag , and fired the first gun , and the shot whistled along between me and the old meeting house .

		The other vessels in the fleet having already commenced a spiteful fire , and continued it with very little cessation until six oclock P.M. .

		The first house that was fired stood where Mr
Gorham	PERSON	now keeps ; the building burned down without communicating with any other ; but it was but a short time before all the north part of the town was in a blaze .

		They landed in their boats from all their vessels at the same moment and threw torches into the doors and windows of the houses and stores , and then fled like cowards on board their little fleet .

		Among the public buildings were a handsome new Court House that stood where the north school house did , and the
Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	that stood on the lot adjoining Mr
Newhalls	PERSON	dwelling house .

		All the buildings on -LSB- blank -RSB- street , on Fore street , from
Fort Burrows	LOCATION	to Exchange street and on Middle Street as far as
Jonah Cox	PERSON	's house , were burnt down , and a more melancholy sight or a more cowardly transaction I did not witness through the remainder of the war ; and before it was over I was in three engagements at sea .


Mowatt	PERSON	immediately withdrew his fleet from the town , and the next day sailed for
Boston	LOCATION	, which was then held and blocked by the English .

		Many people have blamed the inhabitants of
Falmouth	LOCATION	for not defending the town against so small a force : but the truth is it was not in their power , for there was not a cannon mounted in town at that time , and there was a great scarcity of powder .

		There was an old decayed fort and blockhouse where Mrs. Weeks house and garden is ; this fortress was built in the resign of Queen
Anne	PERSON	, and therefore was in a ruinous state by the dilapidation of time : the people all fled into the country in the beginning of winter which set in uncommonly early ; they went out poor and had to live among a people as poor as themselves ; and those that have occupied the stage of life from that time can form but a faint idea of what their ancestors suffered in those `` times that tried men 's -LRB- and women 's -RRB- souls .

Preston Boston	PERSON	18 October 1775 .

		As I think his Majesty 's Service will be benefited by the Ships and Vessels employed in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	being under the immediate direction of the Commodore at
Halifax	LOCATION	I inclose the necessary Orders for that purpose .

		Every appearance of Accomodation between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her Colonies is vanished ; the latter have made their Election in War , which we are now carrying on against each other in the four
New England	LOCATION	Governments , with great Bitterness .

		I have not the least Doubt that most of the
Southern Colonies	ORGANIZATION	will soon follow the Steps of their Brethren to the Northward , the same spirit of Rebellion diffusing itself through the whole Continent .

		What then becomes our Duty but with all possible Dispatch and Spirit to carry his Majesty 's Commands into Execution by making the most vigorous Efforts to punish this ungrateful people and lay Waste their Country on the
Sea Coast	LOCATION	?

		I inclose an extract of a Letter from Governor
-LSB- Francis -RSB- Legge	PERSON	for your information .

		As Passamaquody is not far from the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, direct any Sloop or small Vessel you may have to call there occasionally , and get all possible intelligence of the Rebels intentions and proceedings .

		The
Somerset	LOCATION	being compleated and the forwardness of the Hinchinbrook give me great Pleasure .

		There is no Marine Cloathing here except Shirts and Stockings by the Adventure , of which you have no doubt reserved some at
Halifax	LOCATION	and can be supplied from thence .

		The 1500 Men from
Newbury Port	LOCATION	, who were expected to be gone towards
Halifax	LOCATION	, went up
Kennibeck River	LOCATION	, and tis generally believed are for
Quebec	LOCATION	, from whence we have lately received very unfavourable Accounts .

		I can not close this Letter without assuring you of my entire Approbation of your Conduct with respect to the Ships and in the Yard , where I hope the very necessary regulations and order you have introduced will be punctually observed ; I shall continue to rely upon your Zeal for the Service and your Discretion to pursue every measure for the publick Good , so far as your Authority and Influence may extend , in which you may depend upon my Countenance and Support ; having nothing more at heart than to serve his Majesty faithfully myself , and to discourage and punish every attempt to the contrary in all other persons .

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	Sir Wednesday Tyonderoga Octo : 18th Since my last of the 5th instant , General
Montgomery	PERSON	has favored me with several Letters , Extracts whereof I do myself the Honor to in close You .

		2 The General 's Complaint in No 1 that he wants Men is too well founded -LRB- the enclosed Return will shew how much the
Army	ORGANIZATION	is reduced by Sickness & c. -RRB- at that time all the Men that I could send , were on the Wing to join him , and they arrived on the 9th as You will see by Number 2 .

		It is too true that very few of the Men he sends to this Post return , the greater Part of them are so averse to going back , that they pretend Sickness & skulk about and some -LRB- Even Officers -RRB- go away without Leave , nor can I get the better of them , Altho I do not suffer a Ration of Provision to be issued , unless I countersign the Order , and the sick or pretended sick do not get half Allowance .

		What little Money I have been able to procure at
Albany	LOCATION	; I have sent on ー I fear the Want of Species will be fatal to Us , should every Thing else go will , the Canadians have suffered much by Paper Currency , and a burnt Child dreads the Fire .

		ー Two hundred and fifty three of General
Wooster	PERSON	's Regiment came across
Lake George	LOCATION	on Sunday , but the General is not yet arrived and they do not chuse to move until he does .

		Do not chuse to move !

		Strange Language in an
Army	ORGANIZATION	, but the
Irresistable Force of Necessity	ORGANIZATION	obliges me to put up with it .

		ー This Morning I gave an Order to Lieut Colo : -LSB-
Andrew -RSB- Ward	PERSON	to send a Subaltern , a Serjeant Corporal & twenty Privates , in two Batteaus to carry Powder ,
Artillery Stores	ORGANIZATION	and Rum , The Colo : -LRB- who is a Good Man -RRB- called upon Me to know If he would not be blamed by General
Wooster	PERSON	for Obeying my Orders , I begged him to send the Men , & urged the Necessity , the Men I believe will condescend to go ; I could give many Instances of a Similar Nature ; But General
Montgomery	PERSON	has most justly & Emphatically given the Reason , `` Troops who carry the Spirit of Freedom into the Field & think for themselves '' will not bear either Subordination or Discipline .

		ー If there is any Foundation in the Report that the Garrison intend quitting
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	I conjecture It must arise from Intelligence that Mr
Carlton	PERSON	may have received of Colonel
Arnold	PERSON	's Approach , should the Garrison effect their Escape It may go hard with
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	, whose Numbers in so long and fatiguing a March must be considerably diminished I have therefore reques -LSB- ted -RSB- General
Montgomery	PERSON	to send immediate Intellige -LSB- nce -RSB- of his Situation and Prospects , that
Colo	PERSON	:
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	may Govern himself accordingly .

		ー I am deeply impressed with the Necessity of putting this Place in a proper Posture of Defence .

		ー I have wrote on the Subject to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	before , but I have now only 65 Effectives here -LRB- Exclusive of General Woosters -RRB- who are Insufficient for the Necessary Works carrying on .

		ー I can not help observing that the Reasons General
Montgomery	PERSON	gave in Support of his Opinion for having a Battery on the
West Side	LOCATION	, appears to me so Cogent , that I wonder the Council of War should be opposed to it ; But he was certainly Right to acquiesce in their Determination , as I am morally sure If he had not , that the Men would have been troublesome .

		ー I have no Prospect of getting my Health reestablished at this Place , but in the present Critical Moment , I dare not leave It .

		Much very much is to be done , whether we succeed or fail in
Canada	LOCATION	, The Distance between this &
Philadelphia Great	ORGANIZATION	, and the season so far advanced that the least Delays may be attended with the most fatal Consequences , I therefore humby submit It to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, If it would not be best , to send up a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	with full Power to direct our future
Operations	ORGANIZATION	, to me such a Measure appears highly necessary .

		ー General
Wooster	PERSON	is just arrived here , as he was appointed a Major General by the
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	and that I did not know his Sentiments with Respect to the Rank he considered himself In , in the
Continental Army	ORGANIZATION	, My Intentions were to have him to remain at this Post , but assuring me that his Regiment would not move without him and that Altho ' he thought hard of being superseded Yet he would most readily put himself under the Command of General
Montgomery	PERSON	, that his only Views were the

		Mr. -LSB- Gunning -RSB-

JOHN HANSON	PERSON	TO THE
NEW YORK	LOCATION	PROVINCIAL CONGRESS Gentlemen ー -LSB- Highlands -RSB- October the 18th , 1775 .

		I have taken the liberty to enclose to you the paper delivered to me by Mr.
Yates	PERSON	, and Mr.
Glen	PERSON	.

		Those gentlemen behaved with the greatest politeness , and I imagined that their observations would have been sufficient to have set every thing at the fort in proper order .

		As for my part , when I undertook that business , it was from pure love to my country , and to the rights of mankind , without any views of self-interest ; and never expected any pay for what I did ; and I believe that those who were joined with me acted from the strictest principals of honour .

		I can with truth say , that never any man was ill used passing that river , by any of us , unless he abused us ; and then to receive but a small check , not equal to his demerits .

		It would have been acting genteel to have inquired into the complaint laid before
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, before passing a censure upon the gentlemen at the fort , contained in the four first lines of your letter to them .

		When men act upon principle , and are placed at any particular post of consequence , and find themselves in a precarious situation , it naturally follows they must exercise their own judgment for the good of the post , and ought to be supported by those who placed them there ; which has not been the case in this instance .

		An insult offered to them was offered to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and the abuse of the complainants in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	ought not to have been permitted .

		Had the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	answered our letter relative to the very thing complained of , this never would have happened .

		I must therefore request , gentlemen , the favour of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to appoint somebody in my room , for I will never more go back to the fort .

		I am respectfully , gentlemen , -LSB- & c. -RSB-
John Hanson	PERSON	.

		When your Excellency 's letter of Saturday -LSB- October 14 -RSB- came to hand , the Day was so far spent , that I had no Prospect of an Opportunity to take the Sense of the

		LIEUTENANT
HENRY MOWAT	PERSON	, R.N. , TO VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES -LRB- Copy -RRB- Canceaux in
Casco Bay	LOCATION	19th October 1775 .

		Sir , The fluctuating state of the winds and weather since my departure from
Boston	LOCATION	, have occasioned the delay of this Letter , as will appear in the following part of it .

		The morning after leaving the
Harbour	LOCATION	, the Canceaux with the other Vessels , were brought too off the entrance of
Cape Ann Harbour	LOCATION	, with an intention of going in the moment that the day appeared ; but to my no small mortification a strong gale .

		from the Northward reduced the Vessels under their low Sails , so much so , that the Symmetry and
Spitfire	PERSON	went almost broadside to Leeward : finding myself in this situation , I judged it expedient to secure a Harbour , and accordingly directed the course for
Cape Cod	LOCATION	; where we anchor 'd in the evening of that day .

		The next morning the wind shifting to the Southward of the
West	LOCATION	, we got under Sail , and at day break the following morning , we were close in with
Cape Ann	PERSON	.

		Upon viewing the Town , Mr
Grant	PERSON	the Artillery Officer , gave it as his opinion , that the houses stood too scattered to expect success , with the
Ordnance and Stores	ORGANIZATION	of his department , and in particular from the small number of Carcases , and the uncertainty of their goodness .

		On considering the ill consequences of a disappointment in the first attempt of this expedition , and the advantage of encouragement it would afford the rebels , I thought it most prudent to make choice of an object , where the certainty was more secure ; tho it was not without reluctance I passed this port , as your orders directed me there first , as well as the favourable opportunity of attempting
Squam	ORGANIZATION	at the same time , which I certainly should have done , had the number of troops been sufficient to have landed .

		The proceeding morning the wind carried us off
Cape Elizabeth	LOCATION	, where we again were saluted with a second Northwester , which obliged us to take shelter in the evening of that day , under
Squirrel Island	LOCATION	in Townsend-bay , here we were detained a part of two days , and in the evening of the third , anchored at
Hog Island	LOCATION	road in Casco-bay : At four in the afternoon of the day following , the Vessels were all placed before the town of
Falmouth	LOCATION	without the least resistance : finding the people so disposed , I wrote them a letter -LRB- a copy of which I transmit with this -RRB- and sent Mr
Fraser	PERSON	the Acting Lieutenant on shore to deliver it , which he did , and heard it read in the town house before a large number of the inhabitants ; upon it being read , there was a profound silence , and it was desired to be read a second time , after which , the Chairman with many of the principal people , in particular those who had never joined in any part of the Rebellion , lamented and judged by the stile of the letter , that the punishment was very severe , and more so still , as the time limited was so very short , and that too with the night approaching .

		Mr
Fraser	PERSON	seeing a general distress increase , among the women and children in the Streets , he gave to understand , that if they had any proposal to make to me , he would be the bearer of it , at the same time he could not take upon him to say that it would be received : Upon which they observed that upon his going on board if the boat did not return again in a few minutes , a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in the name of the Town would wait upon me , which they did ; by name ー Brigadier -LSB-
Jedediah -RSB- Pribble -LSB- Preble	PERSON	-RSB- , Doctor -LSB-
Nathaniel -RSB- Coffin	PERSON	, and Mr
Pegan	PERSON	merchant , deputed to know the nature of the chastisement , and to request that a longer time might be allowed them , as it was then just upon Sundown .

		I replied that from the nature of their crime they had not the least right to expect any lenity , and that the power in me vested , authorised me to distinguish those only who I was certain had never aided or assisted in their rebellions proceedings but notwithstanding that , the known Humanity of the British Nation encouraged me , to take so far upon me , that on condition that the people of
Falmouth	LOCATION	in general would in the course of the time that I had given them , deliver up all their Arms and Ammunition with such of themselves as I should make choice of , that I would in that case put off destroying the Town until the determination of the Commanders in Chief of the King 's forces at
Boston	LOCATION	should be known , To this the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	replied , that they would make my demand known to the people immediately , but that it would be impossible to accomplish it , without certain time being granted for the purpose of Assembling them : I observed , that if it was not in their power to do it compleatly this night , they surely could do a part , and therefore , if the town expected a longer time , so many of their Arms must be delivered onboard the Canceaux before Eight o'Clock with the Five Guns that I knew to be on Carriages in the Town , also the rest of the arms with Brigadier
Pribble	PERSON	and such others as I should make choice of , to be forthcoming in the morning : at the same time considering this and every other indulgence void , upon the least hostile appearance of any kind whatsoever .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	declared that the guns on Carriages were removed out of the town on the first appearance of the shipping but that they would do , their utmost in bringing off as many arms as could be brought together in so short a time ; On this promise I suffered them to go on shore , and before the hour of Eight they returned with Ten stand only ー delivering them as a pledge of the faith of the Town in general , that nothing hostile should be offered , and that if my demand was not fully complied with by nine the next morning -LRB- which they beseeched me to grant them -RRB- as it would be impossible to clear the town of the women and children before that hour in case of noncompliance .

		This request I agreed to , and desired a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to be with me half an hour before the time limitted , to which they were punctual ; when they declared that to their no small astonishment , they found that no part of the Inhabitants assembled in the morning , and that the whole town was then in the greatest confusion , with many women and children still remaining in it ; as to themselves , they had only to implore time to go on shore and get out of the way , on which they took leave of the Ship with expressions of thankfulness for the lenity that had been shown ー Perceiving women and children still in the town , I made it forty minutes after nine before the
Signal	ORGANIZATION	was hoisted , which was done with a gun , at the same time the cannonade began from all the vessels and continued till six , by that time the body of the town was in one flame , which would have been the case much sooner , had the Wind favored in the forenoon as it did in the evening , and altho ' a regular cannonade was kept up all the time , numbers of armed men were employed extinguishing the fire before it became general which made it absolutely necessary for some men to be landed , in order to set fire to the vessels , wharfs , storehouses , as well as to many parts of the town that escaped from the shells and carcases , notwithstanding they were executed with the greatest dexterity , to the no small credit of Mr
Grant	PERSON	the artillery Officer , who employed his people , not only onboard , but on shore also , with a certain number of seamen from each of the Vessels , and a party of Marines , all under the command of Mr
Fraser	PERSON	whose spirited conduct , and activity in the execution of that duty , does him every credit that could be expected from such a service , and indeed every man that was with him .

		And with equal justice I can say , that all the Officers and men on this command , shew 'd the greatest readiness , and acted with the greatest composure and harmony in their respective duties ; and with no less satisfaction I acquaint you , Sir , that notwithstanding the vast numbers of armed men that assembled in , and near the town on the occasion ;
Falmouth	LOCATION	, with the Blockhouse and battery , the principal wharfs and storehouses , with eleven sail of vessels , at and near this town , several of which with cargoes , all laid into ashes , including a fine distillery , four vessels taken , all without the loss of one person , and only two slightly wounded , Mr
Larkin Midshipman of the Canceaux	PERSON	and one Marine .

		At the same time I am sorry to say , that had we not been situated close to the town , we should without a doubt have found great difficulty in accomplishing this piece of service , as we soon experienced the insufficiency of the artillery stores , not only in goodness , but in quantity ; the particulars of which shall at a more convenient opportunity be laid before you Sir , which I am sorry to observe will not reflect great credit on the ordnance store at
Boston	LOCATION	: And with equal concern I observe , that the want of a sufficient number of troops , has prevented an effectual sweep being made of all the arms and ammunition not only belonging to the town of
Falmouth	LOCATION	but also of many
Islands	LOCATION	and Villages in Casco-bay , which I am very certain could have been compleatly done with five hundred men ー as well as numbers of Cattle and other fresh provisions equally useful , and not less distressing to this part of the country .

		Our Carcases excepting a few belonging to the Howitzers are all expended , and these are rendered useless by the carriages being disabled which happened early in the Bombardment .

		The Spitfire Sloop is also much shattered , so that I shall be under the necessity of repairing to
Nantasket	LOCATION	to have these wants supplied before I can attempt any other place .

		The troops are also in great distress for want of necessarys , many of them having embarked without a second shirt , from which cause they are rendered incapable of their duty , and are falling sick very fast .

		My intention was to dispatch the
Halifax	LOCATION	immediately with this Letter , but having four vessels to man and take care of I consider it most prudent to keep our small force together till we are nearer .

		I have the honor to be with the highest respect Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		As that Quantity is a Large Proportion for this Town I doubt not the Genl will Order it here , I have therefore Sent no formers , only desire that you would Send Papers for the Cartridges as there is no paper to be had here , The Schooner will be Compleat for Sea by Saturday Night So that if the men are here by that time every thing will be ready , Save the Cartridges , which can be made in a few hours , ー Capt Adams Accepts the Birth of Master & Expects the Same terms as the other masters at

AMBROSE	PERSON	PAGE TO
NICHOLAS COOKE	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Providence	LOCATION	, October 19th , 1775 .

		Sir , ー Here , nothing material has happened since your departure .

		But it seems there is a party in
Newport	LOCATION	endeavoring to get the troops re-called off the island , for reasons , in my opinion , not sufficient only for the flattering promises of Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	.

		He promising to let the wood and ferry-boats pass as vessels , and not to rob them of any stock on that island , and that he will not fire on the town without provocation , unless he is hereafter ordered , and then not without fore warning .

		In consideration of the above promises , he is to have the privilege of fresh meat and beer , & c. , for his ships as usual .

		But his faith and promises have been of so little value to us , in this government , I hope they will not have much weight .

		It seems to be strongly reported that the majority of that town are against the troops being re-called , and if that be the case they must be under the necessity of going out also .

		The Tory party , and
Wallace	PERSON	's fleet , will have the entire government of that town , and doubtless take that opportunity to rob all the islands in the bay .

		They do n't pretend to say he promises for only the island of
Newport	LOCATION	.

		It seems to be the opinion of the principal inhabitants of this town , that a regiment at least ought to be stationed there , not only for the protection of the stock , but the friends of liberty also , which they hitherto scarcely dare show their sentiments .


Wallace	PERSON	is much nettled at what force is there at present .

		His connections are supposed to be the movers of the
Town Council	ORGANIZATION	, and those concerned in this application , as we are informed ... Ambrose Page .

Yourself my Superior	ORGANIZATION	, and that can not be in Virtue of your Appointment by

DAVID WOOSTER	PERSON	TO MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	Sir In Answer to Your Favour of this Day , give me Leave to acquaint You , that immediately upon my Receiving the Continental Articles of War , I gave them out to the different Captains & Commanders of Companies in my Regiment , but they universally declined signing them , of Consequence in the Discipline of the Troops under my
Command	ORGANIZATION	, I was obliged to continue in the Use of the Law Martial of

Virtue of my Commission	ORGANIZATION	from that

NEW YORK	LOCATION	JOURNAL , THURSDAY , OCTOBER 19 , 1775 New-York , October 19 .

		We hear from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, that Col.
Esek Hopkins	PERSON	, a brave and experienced officer , is arrived there , at the town of
Bristol	LOCATION	, with 700 men , sent by General
Washington	LOCATION	in order to protect the inhabitants from the Piratical incursions of a Captain
Wallace	PERSON	, and other Free-Boaters , acting under the pretended authority of a set of Traitors , aiming to establish a tyrannical government on the mins of the English Constitution .

		This Pirate ,
Wallace	PERSON	, having presumed , in a cowardly dependance on his lawless force , to demand the property of the inhabitants , and like other Robbers , threatening them with destruction in case of refusal , which threat he inforced , by murderously and treasonably firing a number of shot against the town of
Bristol	LOCATION	, the inhabitants of which , sent on board the said
Pirate	ORGANIZATION	, a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to expostulate with him on the baseness and villany of his conduct .

		ー In his vindication , he shewed them the orders of the more atrocious and bloody Traitors , under whose authority he acted , by which he was directed to fire upon , murder and destroy every town or city , where there should be the least appearance of men in arms , in order to defend their rights and liberties ; and he told them , that in case there should be the appearance of men in arms , in opposition to His illegal demands , he should certainly fire upon them .

		After he had by threats , extorted from , and robbed the inhabitants of as much of their property as they were , on such a sudden demand , able to produce , Col.
Hopkins	PERSON	and his forces arrived , and on being told
Wallace	PERSON	's menace of firing upon the town , in case of the appearance in it of men in arms , he let the people know his orders from the General , which were , at all events to prevent the
Pirates	ORGANIZATION	from landing , or receiving supplies from the shore ; and that instead of being intimidated from defending their property , by fear of the town being fired upon , they might be assured he would destroy the town , rather than the
Pirates	ORGANIZATION	should land in , or draw supplies or advantage from it .

		A.M. October 19th , 1775 .

		A draft of instructions to the superintendents at the fortifications in the Highlands , respecting vessels passing the said fortifications , was read and filed , and is in the words following , to wit : Gentlemen ー In Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, New-York , Oct. 19 , 1775 .

		We are favoured with yours of the 15th inst .

		and are pleased with your activity in forwarding the fort and works under your charge in the Highlands .

		To obviate all disputes relative to your conduct , it is our desire that you would dispense with the ceremony of vessels lowering their peak as they pass the fort ; we think it can not answer the purpose of detecting the foe , and that for the future you would observe the following rules : 1 .

		In general we do not apprehend any danger can arise from vessels coming from the northward ; you may therefore let them pass unmolested unless you shall have evidence on oath , or a certificate from some committee previously given , that they are intended to supply the ministerial army or navy with succours or necessaries , in which case you are to detain them until you can give the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	or the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	notice thereof , together with such evidence or certificate and receive their orders .

		2 .

		You will permit all vessels from the southward to bass by unmolested , unless you shall have good reason to suspect that they are prosecuting designs , inimical to the general cause , and in such case you will prevent them from proceeding until you shall be satisfied that they have no such designs .

		3 .

		We recommend it to the superintendents of the fort , and also to the inhabitants of the Colony by their general conduct , to use their endeavours to cultivate a good understanding with each other .

		Being confident that the superintendents will not permit those employed under them to use illiberal language to persons navigating the river , and that they will in the exercise of their office give as little trouble to the inhabitants of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	as is possible .

		We are respectfully , gentlemen , -LSB- & c. -RSB- By order .

		To the Commissioners at the fortifications in the Highlands .

		Ordered , That a copy thereof be engrossed and signed by the President , and transmitted .

		Ordered , That
Timothy Doughty	PERSON	and all the other prisoners now in the jail , by order of the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	, be brought down before this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	tomorrow morning to be heard , and that Col.
McDougall	PERSON	be requested to furnish a sufficient guard for that purpose .

Tryon	PERSON	convened such of them as were named in this information , they immediately agreed to go on board Ship except the Collector , who told them his situation was different from theirs , all
Civil Authority	ORGANIZATION	had been for some time taken out of their hands .

		but that he had still been allowed to Act in his station because the Present Rulers found it their Interest as their Ships without his Clearances could not pass the Two Men of War stationed at
New York	LOCATION	, besides he did not think any personal risque could excuse his not acting agreeable to the Acts of Trade until they were suspended by Parliamint or stopped by Violence , which he must submit to .

		The Governor and Kings Attorney & ca accordingly went on board Ship 4 ... The Collector was waited upon by a deputation from the
New York Congress	ORGANIZATION	the day after the Governor left the City , to know if he intended going , He answered No , if proper obedience was sti -LSB- ll -RSB- paid to the Acts of Trade and he and his Family protected , this was promised and punctually complyed with and a Guard set over the

JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	TO

Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RSB- Octr .

		19 , 1775 What Think you of an American Fleet ?

		I do n't Mean 100 ships of the Line , by a Fleet , but I suppose this Term may be applied to any naval Force consisting of several Vessells , tho the Number , the
Weight of Metal	ORGANIZATION	, or the Quantity of Tonnage may be small .

		The Expence would be very great ー true .

		But the Expence might be born and perhaps the Profits and Benefits to be obtained by it , would be a Compensation .

		A naval Force might be created which would do something .

		It would destroy Single Cutter and Cruisers .

		It might destroy small Corvets or Fleets of these like -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	's at
R. Island	LOCATION	and Ld .

		Dunmores at
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		It might oblige our Enemies to sail in Fleets .

		For two or three Vessells of 36 and twenty Guns , well armed and manned might attack and carry a 64 or a 70 or a 50 Gun Ship .

		But there is a great Objection to this .

		All the Trade of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, the Lower Counties , a great Part of
Maryland	LOCATION	and
N. Jersey Sails	PERSON	in between the Capes of
Delaware Bay	LOCATION	.

		And if a strong Fleet should be posted in that
Bay	LOCATION	, Superiour to our Fleet it might obstruct all the Trade of this River .

		Further the Trade of
Virginia	LOCATION	and the rest of
Maryland	LOCATION	floats into
Chesapeak Bay	LOCATION	between the Capes of
Henry	PERSON	and
Charles	PERSON	where a Fleet might stop all .

		Besides
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Maryland	LOCATION	have no Navigation of their own nor any Carpenters to build ships .

		Their whole Trade is carried on in British Bottoms by British , most of it by North British Merchants .

JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	TO
JAMES WARREN	PERSON	Dr. Sir , ー
Philadelphia Octr	LOCATION	.

		19 , 1775 .

		I want to be with you , Tête à Tête , to canvass , and discuss the complicated subject of Trade .

		I say nothing of private Consultations or public Debates , upon this important Head .

		When I write you Letters you must expect nothing from me but unconnected Scraps and broken Hints .

		Continual Successions of Company allow me Time only to Scrawl a Page of Paper , without Thought .

		Shall we hush the Trade of the whole Continent and not permit a Vessell to go out of our Harbours except from one Colony to another ?

		How long will or can our People bear this ?

		I say they can bear it forever .

		If
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	should build a
Wall of Brass	ORGANIZATION	, at low Water Mark , We might live and be happy .

		We must change our Habits , our Prejudices our Palates , our Taste in Dress , Furniture , Equipage , Architecture , etc. , but We can live and be happy .

		But the Question is whether our People have Virtue enough to be mere
Husbandmen	PERSON	,
Mechanicks	PERSON	and Soldiers ?

		That they have not Virtue enough to bear it always I take for granted .

		How long then will their Virtue last ?

		till next Spring ?

		If We Stop all Trade G.B.I. and
W.I.	PERSON	will not be furnished with any Thing .

		Shall We then give Permission for our Vessells to go to foreign Nations , if they can escape the Men of War ?

		Can they escape the Men of War ?

		How many will escape in Proportion ?

		If any Escape , will they not venture to
Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, and
W.I.	PERSON	in defyance of our Association ?

		If they do not will not the
British Dominions	ORGANIZATION	furnish themselves with our Produce from foreign Ports , and thereby avoid that Distress , which We expect will overtake them ?

		Will not the
W.I. Islands	LOCATION	especially , who can not exist without our Provisions for 6 Months , unless Glou -LSB- cester -LRB- ? -RRB-

		and -RSB-
Walker	PERSON	were ignorant .

		If we should invite other maritime Powers , or private adventures from foreign Nations to come here , Will they venture ?

		They run the risque of escaping Men of War , and the Dangers of an unknown Coast .

		Maps and Charts may give Strangers a confused Idea of the Geography of our Country , and of the Principal Inlets of
Harbours	ORGANIZATION	, Rivers , Creeks , Coves ,
Islands	LOCATION	, etc. , but without skillful Pilots , the danger of Shipwreck will be 10 to one .

		This vast object is never out of my Mind .

		Help me to grapple it .

		The
W.I.	LOCATION	,
Barbadoes	PERSON	particularly , begin , We are told Here by a late Vessel , to be terrified out of their Wits .

		The season is advancing , which will either drive us Northward , or Southward , to habitations more comfortable .

		have the happiness to inform you that yesterday the Fort at
Chamblee	LOCATION	was surrendered to us without the loss of one man on our side 70 odd regulars was taken Prisoners & about 94 women & children , which transaction gives new life and vigour to our Troops ; and adds Courage to the Canadians , whose spirits have drooped by the Misconduct of Cl -LSB-
Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	, in
Attacking Montreal	LOCATION	with so Small party that he and his men were allmost intirely cut off , which doubtless you have heard .

		The Canadians I think I may venture to Assert are Quite full on our Side , and the Indians likewise ; whose Friendship we have taken unwearied pains to obtain ; but to return to this Hornets Nest at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, which still continues obstinate , we in the first Place built a Bomb battery about 100 rods South of the Fort which appears to annoy them considerable , we then built a gun battery to the Southward of that , but does not have the desired effect .

		then we built a gun battery on the east side of the River off against the
Fort	LOCATION	, within 100 rods of them , in plain sight , at which battery we have kept a continual fire at their water Craft -LRB- which consist of large scows Gondolas & other Small Craft -RRB- till they are so disanabled That we have nothing to fear from them .

		likewise at their houses which by their appearance is rendered very uncomfortable to them .

		We are about building on the North side off them another battery .

		when the whole comes to be opened upon them , on all sides , I think the dogs must Surrender or find it very hot weather .

		we have more or less Cannonading or bombarding every day , but thro the blessing of God we have onely lost 4 men by their Shot & Shells .

		Our Army is in good health in General and in fine Spirits .

		nothing to Obstruct us from traveling thro

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 20 -LSB- October -RSB- Reports were now industriously spread that the Rebels would certainly soon attack
Boston	LOCATION	on all Sides ; that great preparations were making up
Mistick River	LOCATION	, that in the Night time Boats were to come close along Shore by
Dorchester Point	LOCATION	, and crossing
Gallows Creek	LOCATION	enter the Town on that Side , where they thought it least defended .

		The Knowledge of the Rebels being very numerous in the Neighbourhood of
Boston	LOCATION	, and of their having collected some hundred of Whale Boats in the Rivers and at different parts of the
Bay	LOCATION	, perhaps made such Rumours be more attended to .

		Be that as it may ; The Falcon hawled into the
Creek	LOCATION	as far as she could , and the Nautilus did the same at the mouth of the River leading to
Mistick	LOCATION	.

		Both these Sloops at that time were in a manner useless as Cruizers .

		The Nautilus had all her Rigging and Masts to examine ; her Sails wanted mending , and the Vessel many Repairs , and had many sick people : The Falcon was rather in worse plight with respect to Sails and Rigging , having had a great deal of bad weather going to and coming from -LSB- New -RSB-
Providence	LOCATION	, but she was more considerably so in point of men , being upwards of twenty Seamen short of Complement besides near as many sick on board and at the Hospital .

		But although these Sloops were not then in a Condition to go to Sea , they were of Service in the
Harbour	LOCATION	while the Alarm of being attacked lasted : At the same time they were employed in refitting , and their sick and fatigued people had time to recover .

Timothy Doughty	PERSON	, a prisoner , being brought to the door , was called in .

		The letter from the chairman of the committee of
Dutchess county	LOCATION	, and all the affidavits and proofs against the said
Timothy Doughty	PERSON	were read in his presence ; and the said
Timothy Doughty	PERSON	who declined a trial by the committee of the county where he resides , and put himself , as to all the charges against him , on this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, was fully heard in his denial of the charges against him , and his defence , and ordered to withdraw ; and the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	came to a determination thereon in the words following , to wit : In Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, New-York , Oct. 20th , 1775 .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	having taken the case of
Timothy Doughty	PERSON	, now a prisoner before them , into their serious consideration , do determine , that notwithstanding his constant denial of the matters laid to his charge , they are of opinion that the said
Timothy Doughty	PERSON	hath formerly entertained designs and opinions inimical to the great cause of American liberty , and been a principal instigator of the disturbances which have of late prevailed in the county of
Dutchess	LOCATION	, and that therefore he hath merited the hardships and sufferings which he hath sustained during his imprisonment .

		Nevertheless as he did continue in prison when he had an opportunity to escape , and did voluntarily repose himself upon the equity of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and hath farther promised that he will for the future demean himself in a peaceable and orderly manner , the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	do resolve to acquit the said
Timothy Doughty	PERSON	from any further punishment and recommend it to their constituents to receive him again as a member of the community .

		The said
Timothy Doughty	PERSON	was thereupon called in and the determination of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	read to him , and by order of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	a certified copy thereof was delivered to him , and he was thereupon discharged .

		Yesterday the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	received advice , by express , that two vessels had arrived in
Hampton	LOCATION	road with a reinforcement of soldiers for lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, said to amount to about 200 men .

		They are the troops which his lordship sent for to
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, and which , in our last , were said then to have arrived , some vessels having been seen coming in which were supposed to be those expected by lord
Dunmore	PERSON	.

		Last wednesday -LSB- October 18 -RSB- lord

Kemp	PERSON	's landing , in Princess

		They landed at a place called
Newtown	LOCATION	, two miles below , about dusk , and immediately marched up to
Kemp	PERSON	's , where they broke open a blacksmith 's shop , and destroyed about 50 muskets , which he had to repair , then fell to pillaging a number of other houses , and , by some means or other , got into their possession two officers in the minute service , and four private men .

		The chief object of this notable expedition was to intercept a quantity of gunpowder lately imported , which luckily had been carried off some time before , and is now safely lodged , out of the reach of lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, and all his gang .

		I am much obliged to you , for the Sketch of my Account from your Books , by which I find your Advances on -LSB-
William	PERSON	-RSB-
Willcombs Cargoe	LOCATION	exceed my Expectations , & your kind Intentions to promote my Interest in this Adventure , are too conspicuous to admitt of a Doubt , in my Mind ; & I hope you have not as yet suffer 'd in any Respect on my Acct rather than that should take Place , I would have you dispose of as much Molasses as will ballance your Acct & from every Appearance I should wish to have the remainder lay in Store untill further Orders , unless you discover an Appearance of Danger of its being destroy 'd by our unnatural Enemies , which God forbid : ー I am very sensible that Large Quantities have been thrown into your City , but as it appears to me , our Commerce is now at an End , & the Consumption of that Article is exceeding great & of Course the Demand will soon run the Prices up to at least 2 / ー , If not , should our Affairs take a sudden turn , I should be glad to have that Molasses here , with which I could make a sure
Profitt	PERSON	, before any fresh Importations from the
Islands	LOCATION	, could possibly take Place , as I am convinced there is not more than sufficient of that Article in this Colony , to answer the Demand of the ensuing Six Months , & but very little expected ; these Reasons convince me that it would be prudent to keep it for a Price .

		I am glad to hear of Willcombs Arrival in
Falmouth	LOCATION	, & that he was design 'd for
Barcelona	ORGANIZATION	which should he arrive there , will afford a better Chance for obtaining a further Employ for the Vessell , or for the Sale of her , in some Parts of the Streights , than in
England	LOCATION	, & I now imagine he will not return to you again , but pursue the Plan of freighting his Vessell untill he can dispose of her .

		ー I am sorry to find the Underwriters with you , so averse to take on
Pollicys	LOCATION	, bound this Way , surely they have not an Idea of the Difficulties which will attend the Cruisers guarding this Coast ; as they have no Harbour but
Boston	LOCATION	that they could presume to lay in ; & the boisterous Season is too great for them to keep at Sea ; which induces me to think the Risque is not half so great as they imagine & I really expected they would not have refus 'd 12 PCt on the
Dalton & Cargoe	ORGANIZATION	but as the Capitall is large , & the Prospect of her Voyage being able to afford a good Premium , I conclude to have the several Sums mention 'd in my last , cover 'd at 20 pCt if it can not otherwise be done , but since I wrote you , I have seen an extract of a Letter from a young Gen -LSB- tlema -RSB- n who served Me 7 years in my Store , dated at Point Petre 15th Sept wherein he says , that Capt -LSB-
Eleazer	PERSON	-RSB-
Johnson	PERSON	was bound home , but that he could not sail from thence untill the first of Novr that the Season may be far advanc 'd when he arriv 'd on the Coast , which will bring him a Month Later than I at first imagin 'd , tho ' this -LSB- Fact -RSB- is agreable to what I wrote him under 2d Augt which Letter suppos 'd must have got to hand .

		ー I am glad to find
Willcomb	PERSON	laid in so largely of Provisions , as that Article must be scarce & high all over
Europe	LOCATION	.

		ー I observe the Reason for Willcombs taking from you so much Money , which is obvious to me .

		The unexpected Advance on Bills on
London	LOCATION	, have induc 'd me to inclose you a Dr ` ft for # 300 sterling , that if you sh 'd have Occasion to advance the Premium on the
Dalton	PERSON	, I would not intrude too much on your Goodness of which I have had repeated Instances , or if you should not have Occasion to make that Use of the Money , it will serve to Lessen the Sum you are already in Advance for me .

		This Sett was sent to
Boston	LOCATION	for Sale , when the unhappy Battle of
Lexington	LOCATION	commenced , wch caused such Confusion that no Person was willing to purchase , it has therefore remain 'd a Blank ever since , not having had Occasion to make Use of it , my Friends in
London	LOCATION	are appriz 'd of its Date , & you may with Safety indorse it , & the next
Post	ORGANIZATION	will hand you the second & Third of the Sett : ー Since Willcomb sail 'd , I had a Brig arrived at
Baltimore	LOCATION	from the
West Indies	LOCATION	with a Load of Molasses , which neated me there 21d Currency , free of every Charge even the Duties , & she took in 7,000 Bushells Wheat a 5/3 , & saild for
Falmouth	LOCATION	the 6th Sept consign 'd to my
Friends Champion Dickason & Co	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	; should she arrive in Safety , I doubt not of a fortunate Adventure in her , as the Crops in
Europe	LOCATION	have fallen very short ー I am sorry to find a Prospect of a Prohibition on Provisions with you , as we plac 'd much Dependence on the Severity of our Winters to have bro ' t in large
Quantities of Flour	ORGANIZATION	into this Province , a Plan for which , has been in Contemplation by a few of my Acquaintance , to Join in a Compy & to take up , abt 6 fishing Schooners , prime Sailors , to proceed in Rotation , either to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	or
Baltimore	LOCATION	as the Risque to either Place may appear lest , & to continue all Winter , by which Means we were in Hopes of collecting f -LSB- ro -RSB- m 6 to 10,000 Barrells before March expir 'd , the Profitts on which , would be very handsome , add to which it wd greatly serve the Inhabitants of this Part of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, who will certainly want that Article very much before the Spring opens , but from the Hint you gave me , we must at present put a Stop to our Proceedings untill we can have further Advice , relative to this Matter ; Should the underwriters appear backward in taking a Risque on
Johnson	PERSON	at 20 pCt you may venture a little higher rather than not have it done , as her Voyage will afford a 50 pCt Premium , but this sub Rosa ー therefore in Hopes of soon hearing from you , that this matter is finish 'd to Sattisfaction , I subscribe myself , with

NICHOLAS COOKE	PERSON	TO COLONEL ESEK HOPKINS Sir , ー
Cambridge	LOCATION	, October 21st , 1775 Messrs.
S. Dyre	PERSON	,
J. Jepson	PERSON	, and
J. Malbone	PERSON	, have waited upon me with a Memorial from the
Town Council of Newport	ORGANIZATION	, setting forth the deep distresses of that town , and pressing in the strongest terms for the removal of the troops .

		I laid the application before the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, now sitting here , who unanimously gave their advice that the inhabitants should supply
Wallace	PERSON	with beer and fresh provisions for the use of the ships , as usual , upon his complying with the terms offered on his part ; and that the troops should be kept out of the town of
Newport	LOCATION	.

		They were , also , unanimously of opinion that the troops should remain on the island .

		I accordingly recommend to you to keep the troops out of the town so long as
Wallace	PERSON	shall keep his promise , and make no attempt upon it .

		As the inhabitants are under the greatest anxiety , I submit it to your judgment whether or no ' t it will be consistent with the service and prudent to remove the troops to a further distance from the town .

		If it can be done with safety , I recommend it in order to quiet the minds of the people .

		An express came to General
Washington	LOCATION	, yesterday , from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, with advice that a naval force from
Boston	LOCATION	had appeared off
Falmouth	LOCATION	,
Casco Bay	LOCATION	, and demanded of the inhabitants the surrender of their arms and hostages for their future good behaviour .

		He offered , upon their delivering up part of their arins the same evening , to allow them to the next day to consider of the demands .

		They accordingly delivered him eight muskets .

		The next day a very heavy firing was heard upon
Falmouth	LOCATION	.

		The commander of the fleet showed his orders to the committee ; which were to destroy the town , and
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, in case they should refuse to comply with the demand .

		To me it appears highly probable that
Newport	LOCATION	and the other sea-port towns , may soon expect a similar treatment .

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO JOHN HANCOCK Sir Tionderoga October 21st .

		1775 .

		At four O'Clock this Afternoon I had the Honour to receive your Letter of the 12th Instant .

		I should have been extreamly happy , If
Congress	ORGANIZATION	had been in Sentiment with me on the Necessity of a Delegation from that respectable Body to this Place , a Necessity which to me appears to be absolute .

		A General Sir , who commands an
Army	ORGANIZATION	in which Discipline and Subordination is established and prevails , and every
Corps	ORGANIZATION	of which considers Itself under his immediate Command , can devote the greatest Proportion of his
Time	ORGANIZATION	uninterruptedly to weigh every Measure that It may be necessary for him to pursue in Order to compleat the Wishes of his Superiors ; Unfortunately for me I have seldom , very seldom indeed had half an Hour to Myself in any Period of this Campaign .

		Judge of my Situation at this Moment ; General -LSB-
David -RSB- Worster	PERSON	's Regiment detained here for three Days by violent Gales and heavy Rains , are now in Doubt whether they will proceed to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, The General 's Secretary and his Chaplain inform me , that many of the Officers & most of the Men , apprehend being detained in
Canada	LOCATION	all Winter ; that they may be pre vented by Frost from returning ; that they will perish with Cold or Sickness ; that if the
Army	ORGANIZATION	should be under the Necessity of retreating from
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, many must fall a Sacrifice to the Enemy , as there will not be Boats suffici -LSB- ent -RSB- to bring them away , -LRB- altho ' we really have Craft sufficient for a Thousand more than the
Army	ORGANIZATION	consists of -RRB- ; That none but the General , his Secre -LSB- tary -RSB- and
Champlain	LOCATION	have any Inclination to proceed .

		The Weather is now clearing , the Wind favourable and I wait in the most distressing Anxiety for the Morrow , to see the Event .

		I shall dispatch a Copy of your Letter to General
Montgomery	PERSON	, for him to Execute such of the Orders It contains as relate to the
Affairs of Canada & c.	ORGANIZATION	I am happy that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has so just a Sense of that Gentleman 's Abilities and Zeal his being in this
Army	ORGANIZATION	has been the Source of vas -LSB- t -RSB- Consolation to me .

		I hope his Health will be continued to him that he may be enabled to support that
Variety of Fatigue	ORGANIZATION	both of Mind and Body to which he is every moment exposed .

		Were it possible to foresee the Result of our Operations at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, I should be able to determine if it was necessary to build any Vesse -LSB- ls -RSB- of War on
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, at present I am at a Loss what to do , but least any Detrimen -LSB- t -RSB- should arise to the Public from the Dilemma -LSB- I -RSB- am In , If it is the Intention of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to prepare Timber for constructing such Vessels without waiting the Event of our Operations , the Difference of Time it will take in , my sending t -LSB- o -RSB-
New York	LOCATION	for Carpenters or
Congress	ORGANIZATION	sending ther -LSB- e -RSB- on Receipt of this and ordering them up , can not be much , permit me however to observe that all that can be done this Fall will be to hew the Timber and prepare Roads to draw It out in Winter , so that the
Shipwrights	ORGANIZATION	may begin their Work in April , I say this is all that can be done , for no Plank are to be had here , & if there was , Winter is so severe in this Latitude that no Building could be carried on .

		If the
Tun	PERSON	of Powder mentioned in Your Letter should be sent here , it will be vastly short of what this Garrison and
Fort George	PERSON	ought to have should we be unfortunate at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー Should we succeed , a vastly greater Quantity will be wanted in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		ー
Congress	ORGANIZATION	mentions a Garrison for Crown Point , I suppose that is founded on a Supposition that there is a Fortification at that Place , Whereas in Fact there is none .

		It may be possible this Fall to enclose the
Barracks	ORGANIZATION	with a
Pickett	PERSON	, but that is the most that can be done .

		And very much is wanted here , more -LRB- unless
Canada	LOCATION	should be ours -RRB- than can be at any Rate compleated this Campaign .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	then proceeded to hear the proceedings of the Committe of Safety on the afternoon of the fifteen th day of September last .

		On reading the order appointing
Jacobus Van Zandt	PERSON	,
Lewis Pintard	PERSON	and
Henry Remsen	PERSON	a committee for the purposes therein mentioned , and to furnish them with # 4,000 , the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	requested information what was done with the money , and what contract was made for importing the articles mentioned in that order .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was then informed by Mr.
Van Zandt	PERSON	, that the # 4,000 is sent out on the account and risk of the Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and whatever profits arise on said goods the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are to have the benefit of ; that a vessel is chartered by Messrs.
Jacobus Van Zandt	PERSON	,
Henry Remsen	PERSON	and
Lewis Pintard	PERSON	, to go to sundry places to obtain those goods for the sum of # 550 sterling , payable on delivery of the said goods in any place within particular limits for that purpose mentioned in the charter party ; but that in case of her being seized or taken on her voyage the owner of the vessel is to receive # 300 sterling for her ; that the vessel is to lay 40 working days to receive her cargo , after which she is to receive 40s per day demurrage ; that whatever room may be in the vessel after the goods ordered by the freighters for the benefit of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are laded on board , the owner or owners of the vessel have the liberty to fill up with any goods on their own account , without any deduction from the freight agreed for .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	having received the above information approve of the proceedings of the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	therein , and direct that an entry be made that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	does approve of the contract made by Messrs.
Jacobus Van Zandt	PERSON	,
Lewis Pintard	PERSON	and
Henry Remsen	PERSON	, on behalf of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; and that in the opinion of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the said contract is a judicious , good contract , and on behalf of the

JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	' NOTES OF DEBATES IN THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS -LSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RSB- October 21 , 1775 Saturday .

		Zubly .

		We ca n't do without powder , intelligence , drugs .


Georgia	LOCATION	must have an Indian war , if they ca n't supply the Indians .

		The Creeks and Cherokees are in our Province ; we must have Indian trade .

		Four millions have been spent in six months .

		We have been successful , but we have gained little ; all the power of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, it is true , has gained very little .


New England	LOCATION	has been at great expense , so has
New York	LOCATION	;
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	has spent a hundred thousand pounds of their money , to fortify their river ;
Virginia	LOCATION	as much ;
North Carolina	LOCATION	a great deal ;
South Carolina	LOCATION	have issued a million .

		Eighteen millions of dollars is an enormous sum of money ; whenever your money fails you fail too .

		We are to pay six millions now , twelve millions more presently , and have no trade .

		I would bear the character of a madman , or that of an emissary of Lord
North	PERSON	, rather than believe it possible to pay eighteen millions of dollars without trade .

		Can we make bricks without straw ?

		We can live upon acorns ; but will we ?


Wythe ... Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, whether we consider it in an economical , a moral , or political light , appears to be a great good ; civility and charity , as well as knowledge , are promoted by it .

		The auri sacra fames is a fine subject for philosophers and orators to display themselves upon ; but the abuse of a thing is not an argument against it .

		If the gentleman was possessed of the philosopher 's stone , or
Fortunatus	PERSON	's cap , would he not oblige the continent with the use of it ?

		Why should not
America	LOCATION	have a navy ?

		No maritime power near the sea-coast can be safe without it .

		It is no chimera .

		The Romans suddenly built one in their Carthaginian war .

		Why may not we lay a foundation for it ?

		We abound with firs , iron ore , tar , pitch , turpentine ; we have all the materials for construction of a navy .

		No country exceeds us in felicity of climate or fertility of soil .


America	LOCATION	is one of the wings upon which the British eagle has soared to the skies .

		I am sanguine and enthusiastical enough to wish and to hope that it will be sung , that
America	LOCATION	inter nubila condit .

		British navy will never be able to effect our destruction .

		Before the days of Minos , nations round the Archipelago carried on piratical wars .

		The Moors carry on such wars now , but the pillars of Hercules are their ne plus ultra .

		We are too far off for
Britain	LOCATION	to carry on a piratical war .

		We shall , sometime or other , rise , superior to all the difficulties they may throw in our way .

		I wont say , there is none that doeth good in
Britain	LOCATION	, no , not one ; but I will say , she has not righteous persons enough to save their State .

		They hold those things honorable which please them , and those for just which profit them .

		I know of no instance where a
Colony	ORGANIZATION	has revolted , and a foreign nation has interposed to subdue them ; but many to the contrary .

		If
France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	should furnish ships and soldiers ,
England	LOCATION	must pay them .

		Where are her finances ?

		Why should we divert our people from commerce , and banish our seamen ?

		Our petition may be declared to be received graciously , and promised to be laid before
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, but we can expect no success from it .

		Have they ever condescended to take notice of you ?

		Rapine , depopulation , burning , murder .

		Turn your eyes to
Concord	LOCATION	,
Lexington	LOCATION	,
Charlestown	LOCATION	,
Bristol	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	; there you see the character of Ministry and
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		We shall distress our enemies by stopping trade ; granted .

		But how will the small quantities we shall be able to export supply our enemies ?

		Tricks may be practised .

		If desire of gain prevails with merchants , so does caution against risks .


Gadsden	LOCATION	.

		I wish we could keep to a point .

		I have heard the two gentlemen with a great deal of pleasure .

		I have argued for opening our ports , but am for shutting them until we hear the event of our petition to the King , and longer until
Congress	ORGANIZATION	shall determine otherwise .

		I am for a navy too , and I think that shutting our ports for a time will help us to a navy .

		If we leave our ports open , warm men will have their ships seized and moderate ones will be favored .


Lee	PERSON	.

		When you hoist out a glimmering of hope that the people are to be furnished from abroad , you give a check to your own manufactures .

		Chase .

		A glove has been offered by the gentleman from
Georgia	LOCATION	, and beg leave to discharge my promise to that gentleman , to answer his arguments .

		My position was this ; that the gentleman 's system would end in the total destruction of American liberty .

		I never shall dispute self-evident propositions .

		The present state of things requires reconciliation or means to carry on war .

		Intelligence we must have ; we must have powder and shot ; we must support the credit of our money .

		You must have a navy to carry on the war .

		You ca n't have a navy says the gentleman .

		What is the consequence ?

		I say , that we must submit .


Great Britain	LOCATION	, with twenty ships , can destroy all our trade , and ravage our seacoast ; can block up all your harbors , prevent your getting powder .

		What is the consequence ?

		That we should submit .

		You ca n't trade with nobody ; you must trade with somebody ; you ca n't trade with anybody but
Great Britain	LOCATION	, therefore , I say , we must submit .

		We ca n't trade with foreigners , the gentleman said .

		The whole train of his reasoning proved that we must break our whole association , as to exports and imports .

		If we trade with
Great Britain	LOCATION	, will she furnish us with powder and arms ?

		Our exports are about three millions ; would
Britain	LOCATION	permit us to export to her , and receive cash in return ?

		It would impoverish and ruin
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		They will never permit a trade on our side , without a trade on theirs .

		Gentlemen from
New York	LOCATION	would not permit tobacco and naval stores to be sent to
Great Britain	LOCATION	; nothing that will support their naval power or revenue .

		But will not this break the Union ?

		Would three Colonies stop their staple when the other Colonies exported theirs ?

		Fifteen hundred seamen are employed by the tobacco Colonies ー one hundred and twenty-five sail of British ships ; but you may drop your staple , your tobacco ; but it is difficult to alter old habits .

		We have a great number of female slaves that are best employed about tobacco .


North Carolina	LOCATION	can not , will not , give up their staple .

		The gentleman frorri
Georgia	LOCATION	was for trading with
Great Britain	LOCATION	and all the world .

		He says we ca n't trade with any nation but
Britain	LOCATION	therefore we must trade with
Britain	LOCATION	alone .

		What trade shall we have , if we exclude
Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
West Indies	LOCATION	, British and foreign ?

		Eastern Provinces might carry it on with a small fleet , if their harbors were fortified .

		Southern Colonies can not .


Eastern Colonies	ORGANIZATION	ca n't carry on their trade to that extent , without a naval power to protect them , not only on the coast , but on the ocean , and to the port of their destination .

		The same force that would assist the Eastern Colonies , would be of little service to us in summer time ; it must be a small , narrow , and limited trade .

		The best instrument we have , is our opposition by commerce .

		If we take into consideration
Great Britain	LOCATION	in all her glory ; Commons voted eighteen , twenty millions last war ; eighty thousand seamen , from her trade alone ; her strength is all artificial , from her trade alone .

		Imports from
Great Britain	LOCATION	to the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	are three millions per annum ; fifteen millions to all the world ; one fifth ; three quarters is British manufactures .

		A thousand British vessels are employed in American trade ; twelve thousand sailors ; all out of employ .

		What a stroke !

		do n't take into view
Ireland	LOCATION	or
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		Colonies generally indebted about one year 's importation ; the revenue of tobacco alone half a million , if paid .

		North
Britain	LOCATION	enter less than the quantity , and do n't pay what they bought ; it employs a great number of manufacturers ; reexported abroad , is a million ; it is more .

		Eighty .

		thousand hogsheads are reexported , and it pays British debts .

		The re-export employs ships , sailors , freight , commissions , insurance .

		as the constitutional post now goes regularly , we may with a safe conscience say how d'ye to each other .

		It gives me concern to hear that you are withdrawing from public business ; upon my word , this is not a time for men of abilities with good intentions to be only spectators , if we cant do all the good we cou 'd wish , let us at least endeavour to prevent all the mischief in our power .

		Your good friend
Ld Dunmore	PERSON	is endeavouring to raise all the powers on earth to demolish poor

Conolly	PERSON	despairing of getting up the Country through

Creeks & Cherokees	ORGANIZATION	, and through all the tribes to
Detroit	LOCATION	, by general -LSB-

Pittsburgh	LOCATION	, from thence to
Alexandria	LOCATION	, proclaiming freedom to all servants that will enlist ; there he is to be joined by
Dunmore	PERSON	with the fleet & troops from
England	LOCATION	& march through the Country ... We have given the earliest intelligence of these schemes to our Com .

		of safety , & hope with their endeavours assisted by the
Carolinas & Georgia	ORGANIZATION	, that
Conolly	PERSON	may be intercepted this fall or winter .

		Our military operations this campaign have been very languid from the want of powder , but we still hope our success in
Canada	LOCATION	will be such , as to cut a figure for the first essay , such measures have been taken , as give us good reason to expect a plentifull supply of that necessary article before the next spring , and then we shall be in readiness to receive the very warm attack , which from all our advices , the Ministry are preparing for us , but least then we shou 'd fail in being supply 'd from abroad , every man shou 'd exert himself in making saltpetre .

		Your several plantations wou 'd furnish a good deal & you know the process is easy .

		with plenty of powder the Victory is surely ours .

Pa.	LOCATION	.

		Arch .

		2 .

		The date is approximated .

		Instructions to supply certain military stores to all thirteen gondolas were issued by the
Committee of Safety to Commissary Towers	ORGANIZATION	on October 11 , 1775 .

		Each gondola lists fifteen cutlasses , and the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	records the purchase , on October 20 , of 195 cutlasses .

		None of the gondolas , according to the foregoing returns , carried any muskets , and the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	minutes for October 23 report the delivery of various quantities of firelocks to each gondola .

		Hence , the return would have been made on either October 21 or 22 , and , as the latter date was Sunday , it is probable that Towers ' report was prepared on Saturday , October 21 .


DIXON	PERSON	AND
HUNTER	PERSON	'S
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	GAZETTE , SATURDAY , OCTOBER 21 , 1775
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, October 21 .

		Some time last week Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	was alarmed with information that 19 pieces of cannon were fitted up , and would be soon placed on the wharves , & c. in
Norfolk	LOCATION	, to annoy the ships of war , and that a number of men were daily expected from
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, who were to fire them from behind hogsheads filled with sand .

		Yesterday se ` nnight -LSB- October 13 -RSB- , in consequence of the above intelligence , his Lordship sent ashore a party of soldiers , under command of two officers , who marched through
Norfolk	LOCATION	to the place where the cannon were , destroyed 17 of them , and carried off two for their own use , without molestation .

		The above cannon we are confident were never intended for such a purpose ; on the contrary , they belonged to sundry private Gentlemen , who had them removed there for safety .

		Two companies of regulars are just arrived , viz : Capt.
John Fleming	PERSON	's from
Henrico	LOCATION	, and Capt.
Robert Ballard	PERSON	's from
Mecklenburg	LOCATION	.

		We hear from
Norfolk	LOCATION	, that Capt.
Matthews	PERSON	, of the
Norfolk	LOCATION	minute-men , Mr.
William Robinson	PERSON	and Mr.
John Hancock	PERSON	, have been taken prisoners by Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, but for what we can not learn .

		A large sloop from
St. Eustatia	LOCATION	, mounting 16 six pounders and a number of swivels , is said to be gone up the bay with a large quantity of gunpowder .

		Mr. -LSB-
John -RSB- Goodrich	PERSON	of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, whose vessel Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	suspects of having brought in a supply of that article lately , is confined in irons on board a man of war .

Gen	PERSON	' l
Washington	LOCATION	to take the command of a detachment of said army and proceed on board the

		Before we sailed from
Beverly	PERSON	I think it was a Mr.

Commodore Broughton	PERSON	, I believe in the same way .

		I remark on this that General
Washington	LOCATION	might be suspicious , this being the first enterprise of this nature with sealed orders , might start the mind , but the horrors of death in all its forms would not have opperated to have broke a seal or denyed a duty 2 ー as to the time of sailing from
Beverly	LOCATION	I can not say positively but I believe the 20th or 21st October .

		1 .

		You being already appointed a Captain in the

		The

Congress	ORGANIZATION	upon which no Order had been made 2 .

		What Distinctions are necessary to be made between Vessels & Cargoes taken by the armed Vessels in the Pay of the Continent & those taken by Individuals .

		Should not the fitting out Privateers by Individuals be done under some Authority & Accidental Captures subject to some Regulations to prevent Piracies & other capital Abuses , which may arise ?

		Agreed that the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	ought properly to take Cognizance of all armed Vessels fitted out by Individuals in this Province & that Commissions should be granted in such Cases ; at least that Captures be made under some
Authority	ORGANIZATION	.

		That Captures made by armed Vessels in the Pay of the Continent be disposed of by the General for the publick Use , untill the

JAMES WARREN	PERSON	TO
JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	-LSB-
Watertown	LOCATION	-RSB- The 22d -LSB- October -RSB- We have just heard that the pirates on the Eastern shore have destroyed two-thirds of
Falmouth	LOCATION	burnt down , and have orders to destroy every sea port from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Pemmaquid	LOCATION	.

		This is savage and barbarous in the highest stage .

		What can we wait for now ?

		What more can we want to justifie any step to take , kill and destroy , to refuse them any refreshments , to apprehend our enemies , to confiscate their goods and estates , to open our ports to foreigners , and if practicable to form alliances , etc. , etc. I shall endeavour to see and form a judgment of your plan as soon as I can procure the chart .

		The row gallies you have at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	may be very serviceable in smooth water , but if I am rightly informed would not do in a sea .

		No doubt such might be constructed as would , but I am inclined to think that our cannon armed Vessels , especially as we can be so superiour in men , and are more used to them , will answer the purpose better , if we choose such as sail well .

Warren	PERSON	began on October 20 , 1775 .

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 22 -LSB- October -RSB- The Admiral received a Letter from Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	acquainting him that the Viper ,
Bolton	PERSON	, two Transports , a Schooner for
Virginia	LOCATION	and a Packet for
New York	LOCATION	arrived at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	the 4th instant ; that the Viper , Schooner and
Charlotte Packuet	PERSON	sailed immediately for
New York	LOCATION	; that he had engaged a Quantity of Stock for the Transports , and notwithstanding the Rebel Governor
-LSB- Nicholas -RSB- Cooke	PERSON	of
Providence	LOCATION	sent down 1500 men to prevent it he had got some off .

		He also acquainted the Admiral with his firing upon the Town of
Bristol	LOCATION	, and with his Endeavours to remove the Rebels in Arms from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	; that there was not an Island round him but had two or three hundred men under arms to defend it ; & that the people were vigilant , some of them coming 50 miles upon an Alarm ; but that there was plenty of provision to be got with a sufficient force ; that he had had no regular Supply from the Contract -LSB- or -RSB- for 4 months past , and that if he could not settle some terms with the Town , he must depend upon ravaging the Country for Supplies .

		Captain
Wallace	PERSON	in another Letter acknowledged the Receipt of the Admirals Order of the 17th of September to burn , sink and destroy ; and of other Orders .

		Several two decked Ships and Frigates having by the admiralty been ordered to
America	LOCATION	, some of which it was imagined must very soon arrive , and perhaps be already at
Halifax	LOCATION	, the Admiral now gave leave for the
Somerset	LOCATION	to return fr -LSB- om -RSB- thence to
England	LOCATION	; but he enjoined Captain
Le Cras	PERSON	on his sailing from
that Port	LOCATION	, to leave all his Marines , and as many Seamen and Stores behind as he could spare .

		Never had Ships been more eagerly wished for than at this period to intercept the Rebels outward and homeward bound Vessels , who were carrying on a most pernicious Traffic with the French and Dutch , injurious to the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	and beneficial to themselves by bringing in not only Arms and Ammunition , but other Articles of equal importance to them , and without which they could not keep an
Army	ORGANIZATION	together , nor of Course continue the War .

		The few Ships with the Admiral were continually on Service either cruizing or with Convoys , their coming into Harbour even was no relaxation , for , if not immediately hurried out again and abridged of time to take in their provisions and Stores , a part of their men was generally lent to other Ships , and the rest were sure of a great deal of Employment in Boats .

		So urgent were the Kings affairs and so inadequate had been the force to that time in
America	LOCATION	that it was worn down by Excess of Duty and Hardship .

		The following List contains the Additions to and Decrease of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	since the arrival of the Nautilus and
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	a few days before the Battle of
Lexington	LOCATION	Added and time when fit for Service .

North Carolina	LOCATION	The Viper went to
New York	LOCATION	, And the Raven remained in
Nantasket	LOCATION	until the following Month , when she was ordered to
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		The
Merlin	PERSON	,
Senegal	LOCATION	and
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	therefore were the only Vessels of those abovementioned that were of Service in the joint operations of the
Squadron and Army	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The Condition in which the Scorpion and Viper arrived is partly described in their Captains Letters to the Admiral ; hitherto almost all the small Ships and Sloops that came from
England	LOCATION	had been in want of men , caulking , and repairs .

		All the Sailmakers that could be got were now employed in repairing old and making new Sails for the
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	and
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	; as by reason of the Demands coming for these and other Stores from the Ships at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and the Swan being lately arrived in a manner destitute , the Storeship could not furnish Sails enough , nor indeed many other articles that were wanted .

		The Admiral at this time not only ordered what Stores and Tackle had been requested for the Ships at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	to be supplied , but also directed a further quantity of the most useful Articles ; to the end that those Ships might be able to maintain that important
Post	ORGANIZATION	all the Winter : And the Swan was ordered to be caulked , victualled and stored with the utmost expedition that she might return to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	as soon as possible , & convoy the transports going with these supplies .

		The Viper , sloop-of-war , has aped the piratical conduct of the Ministerial ships to the eastward , by taking several of our vessels , inward bound , without so much as the least colour of their having violated any of the acts of trade .

		Nothing can more clearly manifest the absurdity and injustice of the present measures against this distressed Country , than the violations of those acts which they contend ought to bind the Americans , and which they come to enforce against them by every artifice their wicked hearts can suggest .

		Will a God of justice suffer such matchless wickedness to pass with impunity ?

Philadelphia	LOCATION	, October 23 .

		Last Monday morning -LSB- October 16 -RSB- before day , a transport ship , Captain
Hastings	PERSON	, was stranded on
Brigantine Beach	LOCATION	, on the coast of New-Jersey .

		She had on board Capt.
Duncan Campbel	PERSON	, Lieut.
Sims	PERSON	, two Serjeants , and twenty-one Privates , bound from
Boston	LOCATION	, as they say , for New-York , as a recruiting party .

		The Captain and Lieutenant got off the Beach on Tuesday in a small boat , and are supposed to have gone towards Amboy , but 't is expected they will be taken .

		Captain
Hastings	PERSON	, with three of the soldiers , were brought here last Saturday under a guard .

		The rest of the soldiers will be secured .

		Before they quitted the vessel they threw overboard several pieces of cannon belonging to the vessel , 60 muskets and two and an-half barrels of powder .

		The vessel left
Boston	LOCATION	the 5th of October , in company with a 20 gun ship and one transport with some troops bound for
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		No other ships of war or troops had sailed .

		General
Gage	PERSON	was to sail in a day or two in a merchant ship of 16 guns .

		The 48th and 59th regiments being greatly reduced , the privates are incorporated into other regiments and their officers going home .

		The object of Col.
Arnold	PERSON	's expedition was not known at

		See Journal of H.M. Sloop Kingsfisher , September 29 , 1775 ; also
Barney	PERSON	, ed. ,
Life of Joshua Barney	ORGANIZATION	, 27-28 , which reads : When at last he landed , and saw and heard on every hand the din of preparation , and listened to the groups of old and young as they recounted at corners and public places the story of his country 's wrongs , and the long catalogue of British tyranny and injustice , his heart grew big , his whole frame dilated ー he felt himself already a Commodore !

		ー and glowing with the pride of this anticipated promotion , he suddenly , and unannounced , presented himself in the counting-house of the plain , plodding , sour old merchant , who owned ` the good ship
Sidney	PERSON	, ' ー The old gentleman raised his eyes from the leger -LRB- the mysterious pages of which he was intently studying , -RRB- and fixed them with an inquisitive stare upon the young intruder .

		ー ` Who are you , sir ? '

		at length escaped from him , in a tone of surly impatience .

		ー ` I am
Joshua Barney	PERSON	, master of your ship , just arrived ! '

		ー ` Master of my ship , are you , sir ?

		and how dare you , sir , an apprentice boy , presume to take command of a ship of mine ? '

		ー The ` apprentice boy ' turned upon him a look of calm disdain , and throwing upon the desk before him the ship 's papers and other documents of the voyage which he had brought in his hand ー ` Read these ! '

		said he , and without further reply walked to the window , where he amused himself in looking at the various individuals that passed to and fro .

		ー The merchant in the meantime took up the bundle of papers , pulled down his spectacles from the top of his head , and was soon profoundly interested in the perusal .

		ー The operation was slow ー time wore away , and
Barney	PERSON	's patience began to wear with it : ー he had counted every brick in the opposite house , and read every sign , backwards and forwards , anagrammatizing the names , as far as he could see them up and down street ー he coughed walked to the fire ー trod upon the toes of the great watch-dog that lay stretched before it , and knocked down the poker .

		ー Everything has its end ー the last paper was at length read , and carefully refolded : the old gentleman lifted his spectacles once more above his forehead , and rising from his seat with an agility that little belonged to his ordinary motions , he advanced to the young seaman , seized his hand , and giving it a hearty shake with both his own , exclaimed , ` Captain
Barney	PERSON	, you are welcome home , sir !

		I am glad to see you !

		I congratulate you heartily upon your safe return !

		your conduct meets my cordial approbation , sir , and I am proud to find that I have so deserving a young man in my employ .

		ー Take a seat , sir ; we shall see what 's to be done immediately ! '

		ー The compellation with which the venerable merchant commenced this flattering address , was more soothing than all the rest of the compliment : ー to be called ` captain , ' by one who had the legitimate right to bestow such titles , was indeed an honor to be prized ; it wiped away all remembrance of his insulting reception , and when the business of the interview was finished , he made his retiring bow in the firm persuasion that
John Smith	PERSON	was one of the first merchants in the world !

		Thus ended this truly eventful voyage ー the ship had been absent nearly nine months , during the last eight ー of which
Barney	PERSON	had been her commander , though at the moment of his arrival but sixteen years and three months old .

		He had already gone through scenes , and triumphed over difficulties , such as occur to few seamen in the course of a long life spent in navigation .

William Campbell	PERSON	Governor of this Province on the 7h of September
Lieut Fergusson	PERSON	arrived here with His Majesty 's armed Ship Cherokee ; and notwithstanding the particular service she was intended for it was thought necessary I should detain her in this port and the Governor being of opinion that her small Complement of Men was not sufficient for the Service that might be required of her ; I have ordered Lieutenant
Fergusson	PERSON	to procure for the Service 20 able bodied Men , and to bear them on the Books of the Ship he commands as Supernumeraries for Victuals and Wages .

		I have also procured Pilots for both Ships as well for their Safety as to assist any of His Majesty 's Ships in entering this port the people of
Charles Town	LOCATION	having strictly ordered their Pilots not to go out of the Harbour .

		On the 24h September I seized and have detained a very fine Schooner that had on board a hun -LSB- dred -RSB- Cannon Shot I understanding she chiefly belongs to an Officer in the
Rebel Army	ORGANIZATION	and as they have actually armed Schooners in this Port it is said with an intention to attack His Majesty 's Ships have more readily detained the above mentioned Schooner as it was by the Governors desire who was then on board for safety thinking her exceedingly fit for that purpose .

		INHABITANTS OF NORTH YARMOUTH TO GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	May it please your Excellency We the Inhabitants of
North Yarmouth	LOCATION	and New Glocester in the County of
Cumberland	LOCATION	beg Leave to acquaint your Excellency that We in these and the neighbouring Towns are greatly alarmed and distressed by the Desolation of a great Part of the Town of
Falmouth	LOCATION	which was on Wednesday last -LSB- October 18 -RSB- cannonaded and set on Fire by some of his Majestys Ships of War , the Particulars of which we suppose your Excellency has already received some other Way .

		We have been informed their Design was next to assault and destroy
North Yarmouth	LOCATION	.

		But that which gives us the most painful Apprehensions is , a Jealousy that their Design is to take Possession of
Falmouth Neck	LOCATION	and fortify an Eminence there from which we judge it woud be most difficult if not impracticable to dislodge them .

		In this Case they woud enjoy a most commodius Harbour for their Ships & be able to annoy and distress the defenceless Country around them at pleasure .

		We woud further inform your Excellency that we are weak and unprovided with Artillery and military Stores in this Part of the Country and shoud they erect a Fortress and garrison it with Troops as we have supposed , we judge that unless we are assisted by some of your
Army	ORGANIZATION	or other Ways we must be obliged to fly with our Families or submit to their superiour Power .

		And as to the Importance of this Part of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	to the others we refer your Excellency to others who are acquainted therewith and can fully inform you .

		Certain it is that from this Part of the Country may be carried Plenty of Fuel Timber & c. and large Stocks of all Kinds of Cattle which woud be most serviceable to our Enemies if they shoud once get Possession of this Part of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and thus they might be greatly assisted in carrying on Hostilities against other Places .

		In these distressing Circumstances , we woud commend Ourselves to your Excellencys Attention and Compassion , referring the Matter to your Wisdom whether you will not judge it expedient to take Possession of the said Eminence in
Falmouth	LOCATION	and fortify and garrison it with some of the Forces under your Command , which woud at the same Time prevent such another terrible Ruin as has befallen great Part of that
Town	ORGANIZATION	and also guard the other Parts of this Part of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	from Ravages and Devastations .

		But if your Excellency shoud not judge this to be expedient yet we woud pray your Excellency to afford us such
Assistance of Men & military Stores	ORGANIZATION	as your Excellency shall judge proper ; that we may not be exposed every Hour to be plunderd burnt and destroyed , or be forced naked and helpless to leave our Settlements and Habitations and fly for shelter to some other Parts of the Country .

		Thus have we briefly and imperfectly ventur 'd to lay before your Excellency our distressed Scituation and the Anxiety of Mind we are in , not doubting but your Excellency will judge our Case worthy your Attention and that your Benevolences to the distressed tho they may be utterly unknown to you will influence you to do your Endeavours to afford us that Assistance which you shall think we stand in Need of .

		For further Information we beg Leave to refer your Excellency to Dr
Edward Russell	PERSON	the Bearer hereof a Gentleman that resides in
North Yarmouth	LOCATION	and is capable of giving your Excellency any further Intelligence you shall need .

Prospect-Hill	PERSON	, October 24 , 1775 .

		By an express that arrived from
Falmouth	LOCATION	last night , we learn the greatest part of the Town is in ashes .

		The enemy fired above three thousand shot into it , and a large number of carcasses and bombs , which sat the Town on fire .

		The enemy landed once or twice , to set fire to the stores ; they lost eight or ten men in the attempt , and had one taken prisoner .

		The inhabitants got out a very considerable part of their furniture ; no person killed or wounded during the whole time of their firing .

		The enemy produced orders from Admiral
Graves	PERSON	, to burn all the Towns from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Mowat	PERSON	informed the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	at
Falmouth	LOCATION	, that there had arrived orders from
England	LOCATION	, about ten days since , to burn all the sea-port Towns upon the Continent , that would not lay down and deliver up their arms , and give hostages for their future good behaviour .

		He also acquainted them , that he expected the City of
New York	LOCATION	was in ashes .

		By these accounts we may learn what we have to expect .

		I think
Newport	LOCATION	should be fortified in the best manner it can be .

		Doubtless the enemy will make an attempt to get the stock off the island .

		Provisions should be made to defeat them .

		Death and desolation seem to mark their footsteps .

		The fifteenth instant , at three o'clock in the morning , the transport ship
Rachel	PERSON	and
Francis	PERSON	, 1 Capt.
Hastings	PERSON	, was stranded upon
Brigantine	LOCATION	beach , on the coast of New-Jersey .

		She had on board Capt.
Duncan Campbell	PERSON	, Lieut. -LSB-
James Smith	PERSON	-RSB- Sims , two serjeants and twenty-one privates , belonging to his Majesty 's ROYAL HIGHLAND REGIMENT OF EMIGRANTS , bound from
Boston	LOCATION	-LRB- they say -RRB- to New-York , as a recruiting party .

		The Capt. and Lieut. got off the beach the next day , in a small boat , and went towards New-York , in order to get on board the
Asia	LOCATION	man of war , which they would have effected , if they had not been prevented by the zeal and activity of Lieut.
Loveland	LOCATION	of Egg-Harbour ; who , after a tedious pursuit of one day and two nights , t0ok them on board a boat at Cranberry inlet , about thirty-five miles from New-York , in which he was assisted by
Lieut Cook	PERSON	with six men , from an adjacent county , his own party being wore out with fatigue .

		They did not seem greatly alarmed when first taken , but
Sims	PERSON	said he would pay handsomely to be carried to New-York .

		As some of the privates are known to have been formerly in this city , one of them a servant , and another a soldier , it is supposed they were selected as fit persons to inveigle servants and others into the ministerial service .

		Captain
Hastings	PERSON	, and three of the soldiers , were conducted here last Saturday -LSB- October 21 -RSB- evening under a guard .

		The rest of the soldiers , and the Captain and Lieutenant were brought here this day .

		Before they quitted the vessel , they threw overboard several pieces of cannon belonging to it , sixty muskets , and two barrels and a half of powder .

		The vessel left
Boston	LOCATION	the fifth of October , in company with a twenty gun ship , and one transport with some troops bound for
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		No other ships of war or troops had sailed .

		ー We had an Express yesterday from
Falmouth Casco Bay	LOCATION	who brings News that a Number of the Enemy 's Ships were in that
Harbour	LOCATION	, the Capt of which after informing the Inhabts that they must deliver Up all their Arms & give Hostages for their peaceable Behaviour , & allowing them 24 Hours to comply or he should fire the Town .

		At the Expiration of the

		As they had inform 'd the People of

NICHOLAS COOKE	PERSON	TO GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	Sir , ー
Providence	LOCATION	, October 25th , 1775 .

		Capt.
Whipple	PERSON	returned here from his voyage to
Bermuda	LOCATION	, on Friday last -LSB- October 20 -RSB- .

		He had received authentic intelligence of the arrival of the packet at
New York	LOCATION	before the first time limited for his cruise was expired , and immediately sailed for
Bermuda	LOCATION	.

		He had light flattering winds for several days , and when near the island met with a violent gale , which drove him three or four degrees to the southward , which occasioned his having a long passage .

		He put in at the west end of the island where the inhabitants , taking him to be an armed vessel belonging to the King , were thrown into the utmost confusion , and the women and children fled into the country .

		But upon showing them his commission and instructions , were satisfied and treated him with great cordiality and friendship .

		They informed him that upon the powder being removed , the Governor had given General
Gage	PERSON	an account of the part they had taken in the transaction , who had dispatched a sloop-of-war and a transport of 600 tone , to take all the provisions sent to the island .

		They then lay at
Georgetown	LOCATION	, and treated the islanders as rebels .

		Capt.
Whipple	PERSON	had five of the King 's Council on board his sloop , who all assured him that the inhabitants were friends to the American cause , and heartily disposed to serve it .

		As the assistance they gave in the removal of the powder hath made them obnoxious to the enemy , and reduced them to a disagreeable situation , I think they ought to be treated with every mark of friendship .

		I submit to your Excellency the propriety of your representing their case to the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and recommending them to favour .

		ー We are fitting out Capt.
Whipple	PERSON	for a cruise to the eastward with all possible expedition , which I hope will prove more fortunate than his last .

		I am , with acknowledgement for the polite treatment received from you at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and with great respect , Sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB-

Cooke	PERSON	.

		P.S. I enclose your address to the inhabitants of

		A LETTER FROM
MARTINIQUE	LOCATION	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Martinico	LOCATION	, October 25 .

		A few days ago an English frigate cast anchor in the harbour of Fort-Royal , under the cannon of the fort , and sent some armed men in her boats to seize a New-England vessel which lay in that harbour , whose crew they made prisoners , then plundered the vessel , and afterwards left her to the mercy of the waves .

		ー The Count de Nozieres being then at
Guadaloupe	LOCATION	, the
Sieur de Sablonet	LOCATION	, commandant in his absence at
Fort Royal	LOCATION	, failed not to take upon him to punish this violation of the law of nations by firing on the English frigate , which , after this expedition , sailed for
St. Pierre	LOCATION	, where there were then a dozen ships belonging to New-England .

		The frigate anchored , without ceremony , also in that port , and dispatched her boats to visit the ships which she suspected to be laden with warlike ammunition ; but as they met with resistance from the first they attempted to board , the inhabitants of St.
Pierre	PERSON	defended the English Americans , and having armed themselves , took the boats , with their crews , and the men were conveyed ashore , notwithstanding all their resistance ; some of them were wounded on this occasion .

		The
Count de Choiseul-Meuze	PERSON	, second in command at
Martinico	LOCATION	, and then chief in the absence of the general , immediately went to the storehouse where the English were detained , and after sharply upbraiding them for so manifest an infraction of the law of nations , he sent a detachment on board the English frigate , and caused it to be signified to the commander , that he would not release his men till such time as he had repaired the injury which had been done ; this was accompanied with an express order to put to sea immediately after ; and the more efficaciously to decide the matter , he instantly set about preparing the battery of
St. Martha	LOCATION	, and threatening to sink the English frigate , if she deferred giving the satisfaction which was demanded .

		The firmness of our commandant had its effects on the captain , who speedily performed what was desired , and then weighed anchor , after having received his boats and his men .

WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, October 26 , 1775 .

		We have had no Event of any Consequence in our Camp for some Time , our whole Attention being taken up with Preparations for the Winter , and forming the new
Army	ORGANIZATION	, in which many Difficulties occur .

		The Enemy expect considerable Reinforcements this Winter and from all Accounts are garrisoning
Gibraltar	LOCATION	and other Places with foreign Troops , in order to bring the former garrisons to
America	LOCATION	.

		The Ministry have begun the Destruction of our
Sea Port Towns	LOCATION	, by burning a flourishing Town of about 300 Houses to the Eastward called
Falmouth	LOCATION	.

		This they Effected with every Circumstance of Cruelty and Barbarity , which Revenge and Malice could suggest .

		We expect every Moment to hear other Places have been attempted and have been better prepared for their Reception .

		The more I reflect upon the Importance of your Expedition , the greater is my Concern , least it should sink under insuperable Difficulties .

		I look upon the Interests and Salvation of our bleeding Country in a great Degree to depend upon your Success .

		I know you feel it 's Importance as connected not only with your own Honour and Happiness ; but the publick Wellfare , so that you can want no Incitements to press on , if it be possible .

		My anxiety suggests some Doubts , which your better Acquaintance with the Country will enable you to remove .

		Would it not have been practicable to pass
St John	PERSON	's , leaving Force enough for a Blockade ; or if you could not spare the Men , passing it wholly , possessing yourselves of
Montreal	LOCATION	, and the surrounding Country ?

		Would not St.
John	PERSON	's have fallen of Course or what would have been the probable Consequences ?

		Believe me , dear General , I do not mean to imply the smallest Doubt of the Propriety of your Operations , or of those of Mr.
Montgomery	PERSON	, for whom I have a great Respect .

		ー I too well know the absurdity of judging upon a military Operation , when you are without the Knowledge of it 's concomitant Circumstances .

		I only mean it as a matter of Curiosity , and to suggest to you my imperfect Idea on the subject .

		I am with the utmost truth and Regard , etc. 1 .

		We urged that the ship and her cargo belonged to the

Williamsburg	LOCATION	-LSB- October 26 -RSB- The affair at
Hampton	LOCATION	is at once a proof of the natural bravery of our countrymen , of the excellence of their aim in firing , and of the insignificancy of tenders .

		No troops could shew more intrepedity than the raw , new raised men , under the command of captain -LSB-
George -RSB- Nicholas	PERSON	, of the second regiment , and captain -LSB-
George -RSB- Lyne	PERSON	, of the minute men , together with some of the country militia .

		These brave young officers , at the head of their men , without the least cover or breast-work , on the open shore , stood a discharge of 4 pounders , and other cannon , froin a large schooner commanded by captain
Squire	PERSON	himself , and from a sloop and two tenders , which played on them with all their guns , swivels , and muskets .

		They stood cooly till the vessels were near enough for them to do execution , when they began a brisk and well directed fire , which forced the little squadron to retire .

		In the night the tenders forced their way through the vessels , which were sunk in the mouth of the river , and came close up to the very town , on which they fired till they were again repulsed with the loss of 9 men killed on board the schooner , and many wounded , 2 killed on board a tender which was boarded and taken , and from which lieutenant Write -LSB-
Wright	PERSON	-RSB- , of the Otter , made his escape wounded , by swimming to the schooner on the opposite shore .

		Colonel
Woodford	PERSON	, who had just entered the town as the fire began , with a reinforcement of 50 fine riflemen under the command of captain -LSB-
Abraham -RSB- Bluford	PERSON	, an experienced and brave rifleman , compleated the victory , and we have no doubt , could they have arrived an hour sooner , so as to have posted their men properly , that the schooner and tenders would have been taken .

Beverly	PERSON	27th Octobr 1775 I received your favor to me of the 25th & Communicated that part of it which regarded Col. -LSB-
John -RSB- Glover	PERSON	unto him ー when I last wrote to you , I gave the true reasons , for the delay attending the fitting out of these two vessells I observe you had given orders to young
Glover	PERSON	for all the things write to you for , & he is returned without the most Material Article , which is the 300 Swivel shot , he says there was none but he says there was plenty of four ounce bulletts , which if had one ounce of Sense he must have Known woud answer all the purposes this young Gentleman I find has applied to you for a subaltern & twenty Men more than was intended for this vessel , I can easily See his reason for it , was to get on board with him , a favorite young officer who he apprehended woud not be allowed without an addition of men , I see no objection to indulge him with his freind , but I realy see no Necessity for the 20 men Nor has there been a provision of Stores Laid in for more than the original number , you must allso Consider , that if you indulge one , you must indulge the whole I have told him -LRB- as his father did not chuse to interfere -RRB- that he may have his friend if he pleasd , who with 50 more officers included , is all I woud suffer to go on board except I had written orders from Headquarters to the Contrary I am very Sure that Number Must be full sufficient for all the purposes these Vessells are intended for all above that Number Must be an incumberance on board one of these small vessells , & you will find when the Accounts Come in , the expence full enough without such an addition ー pray What Keeps Capt.
Adams	PERSON	& his Company .

		His vessell has got all her guns provision & c on board & I know there will be many things wanting which we Can not possibly think of untill he Comes , as Capt.

Adams	PERSON	Can take sufficient for both vessels , & give Manly his proportion at

BENJAMIN HICHBORN	ORGANIZATION	TO
JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	Dear Sir ー
Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	28 Octr 1775 If tears of blood were to follow my pen , they wou 'd but faintly marke the distressing anxiety I have suffered for near three Months past ー to be betrayed into a situation which equally exposed me to the Insults of my Enemies and the Suspicions or Contempt of my Friends , by a Scoundrel whose base duplicity , I cou 'd neither expose or counteract , excited feelings , which often proved too severe a trial for my utmost fortitude ー I have been a week in the Country & till now have not had resolution enough to write you a line ー I have so much to communicate , that at present I shall only relieve my Mind of what I can not contain .

		ー It was generally presumed -LRB- & I confess with the greatest apparent reason -RRB- that the discovery of those letters was owing to my imprudence ー imprudence in such a Case I should esteem a Crime , & a crime of such a nature as , in myself , I could never pardon the circumstances were shortly these ー when we came to
New York	LOCATION	, contrary to our expectations , we found a packet boat waiting for Passengers , & in the opinion of every one there was not the least Danger in crossing the Sound , we accordingly took passage for
New Port	LOCATION	, & I never saw more reason for destroying your letters till the second day we had been on board the Man of war , than there was for throwing them in the
River Delaware	LOCATION	.

		Capt Ayscough Received us on board the Ship with the greatest politeness & Civility , making a thousand apologies for the rough treatment he had given us ー said his object was the Sailors , who were in the boat with us , & was very sorry he had stopt us in our passage this continued till the next day , when His Conduct suddenly wore a quite different appearance ー I told
Mr White	PERSON	, that
Scoundrel Stone	PERSON	, -LRB- a person who formerly was Clerk to
Henry Lloyd	PERSON	, & came passenger with us from
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- had given Ayscough some information which had produced this Change in his Conduct , & it was time for me to secure my letters , I had before this secreted them in a part of the Ship where I thought them perfectly safe ー I immediately loaded them with money of the least Value I had about me intending , to Drop them over board in the Event : we -LRB- Mr
White	PERSON	& myself -RRB- were then told that we must look upon ourselves as prisoners , & while Mr
Stone	PERSON	was caressed in the
Cabin	LOCATION	, we had a Centinel over us ー However I had then , not the least doubt of eluding their Strictest Scrutiny ー my plan I thought was compleat & ensured me success ; I had provided a couple of blank letters directed to
General Washington & Colo	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
James -RSB- Warren	PERSON	, which in Case Stone should acknowledge himself the Informer & confront me with his declaration , I intended to deliver up with seeming reluctance & pretend I had concealed them through fear ー just as the boat was preparing to carry our baggage on board Capt :
Wallace	PERSON	for examination a Gentleman who came passenger with us from
New York	LOCATION	sent on board for a trunk which we thro ' mistake had taken for our own , this circumstance looked so favourable that I could not avoid seizing , to get the Letters on shore ー I opened the trunk with my own key put the letters in the folds of the Gentns Linen & with some difficulty locked it again , when the trunk came upon deck the Lieutenant mistook it for mine put it into the boat with the rest of our things & rowed off immediately on board the other Ship ー by such a mere accident as this , did the letters fall into their Hands ー The next day an Officer told
Mr White	PERSON	that he heard Stone giving the Capt : information of the Letters , or we shoud never have been searched or suspected ー General
Washington	LOCATION	does not yet appear altogether Satisfied with my Conduct ー the only Satisfaction I have at present arises from the generous Reception I met with from
Colol Warren	PERSON	, but my anxiety to know your Sentiments of the part I have taken prevents my attention to any thing else ー I am sensible of the injustice I do you in harbouring the least diffidence of your generosity , but at the same time I know your nice feelings must receive such a shock from having your confidential observations , upon such delicate Subjects exposed , that the Reflection gives me the keenest of pain ー
General Washington & the World	ORGANIZATION	, may think meanly of me , but suffer me to say without the appearance of adulation , ー possessed of your Confidence & favourable opinion , I can be happy under their united frowns ー nothing but a line of approbation from you can restore me to myself ー let me intreat you , if from no other motives but pity , to send me a short letter by the
Post	ORGANIZATION	, & I will then open myself to you with the greatest freedom ー enclosed you have a rude plan of a design which I am satisfied may be carried into execution with the .

		greatest ease ー I Propose communicating it to the Genl through Mr -LSB-
James -RSB- Bowdoin	PERSON	ー I am Sir your unhappy but Sincere Friend B N Hichborn 1 .

		1775 When we removed Part of the Live Stock from

		The plentiful Rains that have since fallen have increased the Feed so much that there are now upwards of 300 fit for Market .

		The Island is situated so far from the Continent that any Attempt to remove them will be extremely hazardous ; And I can think of no other Method to prevent their being taken by the Enemy , than killing and salting them .

		As we have no Demand for salted Provisions in this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, I must desire your Excellency to take order that the Beef , when barrelled , may be received into the Magazines in Camp , at a reasonable Price ; in which Case they will be killed and cured forthwith .

		ー You are sensible Sir of the unhappy Situation of this Colony with Respect to the Enemy , it being scarcely any Thing more than a line of

DIXON	PERSON	&
HUNTER	PERSON	'S
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	GAZETTE , SATURDAY , OCTOBER 28 , 1775
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, October 28 .

		After Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, with his troops and the navy , had been for several weeks seizing the persons and property of his Majesty 's peaceable subjects in this colony , on Wednesday night last -LSB- October 25 -RSB- a party from an armed tender landed near
Hampton	LOCATION	, and took away a valuable Negro man slave and a sail from the owner ; next morning there appeared off the mouth of
Hampton	LOCATION	river a large armed schooner , a sloop , and three tenders , with soldiers on board , and a message was received at
Hampton	LOCATION	, from Captain
Squires	PERSON	, on board the schooner , that he would that day land and burn the town ; on which a company of regulars and a company of minute-men , who had been placed there in consequence of former threats , denounced against that place made the best disposition to prevent their landing , aided by a body of militia , who were suddenly called together on the occasion .

		The enemy accordingly attempted to land , but were retarded by some boats sunk across the channel for that purpose ; upon this they fired several small cannon at the provincials , without any effect , who , in return , discharged their small arms , so effectually , as to make the enemy move off , with the loss of several men , as it is believed ; but they had , in the mean time , burnt down a house belonging to Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	on that river .

		On intelligence of this reaching
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, about nine at night a company of riflemen were despatched to the aid of
Hampton	LOCATION	, and the Colonel of the 2d regiment sent to take the command of the whole , who , with the company , arrived about eight o'clock next morning .

		The enemy had , in the night , cut through the boats sunk , and made a passage for their vessels , which were drawn up close to the town , and began to fire upon it soon after the arrival of the party from
Williamsburg	LOCATION	; but as soon as our men were disposed as to give them a few shot , they went off so hastily that our people took a small tender with five white men , a woman , and two slaves , 6 swivels , 7 muskets , some small arms and other things , a sword , pistols , and several papers belonging to a Lieutenant
Wright	PERSON	, who made his escape by jumping overboard , and swimming away with Mr.
King	PERSON	's Negro man , who are on shore , and a pursuit , it is hoped , may overtake them .

		There were in the vessel two men mortally wounded , one is since dead , and the other near his end ; besides which , we are informed , nine men were seen to be thrown overboard from one of the vessels .

		We had not a man wounded .

		The vessels went over to
Norfolk	LOCATION	, and we are informed the whole force from thence is intended to visit
Hampton	LOCATION	to-day .

		If they come , we hope our brave troops are prepared for them , as we can with pleasure assure the public that every part of them behaved with spirit and bravery , and are wishing for another skirmish .

		Great , indeed , has been His Majesty 's forebearance , and patience , with the perverse Americans .

		His Majestys benign good heart , has , my Lord , been tryed , to the very utmost extreme of tenderest humanity .

		The excesses of outragious madness become grievous and intollerable .

		No wonder , my Lord , they have turned the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	compassion into anger .

		These wicked people have compelled His Majesty to the determination of puting in force such vigorous efforts , as may reduce the rebellious to order and obedience .

		I hope in God the effects of these measures , will be speedily most severely felt by them , that they may meet such just punishments as are the rewards of such enormous crimes .

		It is very unfortunate your Lordships expectations , are disapointed in the conduct of the Southern Provinces .

		All the Provinces north of
East Florida	LOCATION	, have entered into and adopted , the wicked measures of the
Massachusets	LOCATION	.

		I trust now , my Lord , better times are not far off , that , the Plans forming may be attended with the most propitious success , untill our excellent Constitution be in permanence firmly fixed , and His Majesty 's Government perfectly established , over all the British Dominions .

		ー I Waited on
Capt Potter	PERSON	, but could not agree with him for them I went next morning on

ALEXANDER McDOUGALL	PERSON	TO
JOHN JAY Dear Sir	PERSON	, New york 30th Octor 1775 I have many matters of importance to communicate to you , respecting our own Safety and the
Public Security	ORGANIZATION	, which time will not now permit to enumerate .

		Sufice it that the Tories are chearfal , and too many of the Whigs make long Faces .

		Men of rank and Consideration refuse to accept of commissions as Field officers of the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	; so that these commissions have gone a beging for Six or Seven weeks .

		This requires no Comment to one of your disernment .

		Our
Congress	ORGANIZATION	wrote Some days Since to your 's , to replace the Powder you order -LSB- ed -RSB- from us for
Continental Service	ORGANIZATION	, and that we voluntarily spared it .

		But we have not been favoured with an answer , altho we have not 300 lb at our Command if it would Save the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	; and the inhabitants are very illey Supplied , not a Quarter of a Pound per man in the Hands of half the
Citizens	ORGANIZATION	; and the Country much worse .

		This .

		is a deploreable State to be in for men who have their all at Stake .

		`` For God 's '' Sake quicken the replacing of our Powder .

		The serving of Artillery require men of more Talents and greater Soberity than is requisite for musketry ; the former being more complex than the Latter .

		For this reason I got our
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to write to yours for an order to enlist matrosses for the Fort on
Hudsons River	LOCATION	.

		what detains it ?

		are the men for this part of the Service to be raised when the Guns are mounted ; and thereby expose the
Post	ORGANIZATION	to fall into the Hands of the Enemy from the unskilfulness of the matrosses .

		You may be assured infantry alone can not defend Such a Post ; unless they have been long Trained to the Artillery .

		General Waster 's -LSB-
David Wooster	PERSON	's -RSB- corps , which you ordered for the Fort , is by this at
St John	ORGANIZATION	's in Consequence of orders he received from
Genl Schuyler	PERSON	, before yours to the former to return hither reached him : that there are no
Continental Forces	ORGANIZATION	nearer the
Post	ORGANIZATION	on Hudsons river , than lake
George	PERSON	, except two incompleat Companies in our
Barracks	ORGANIZATION	; one of the first and the other of the Third Regiment .

		As it will be very difficult if not imposible , to procure the Stores Necessary for that
Post	ORGANIZATION	, on the
Sea Coast	LOCATION	, I wish the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, would pass an order without delay to enable us to take
Such Stores	ORGANIZATION	from
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, as will be wanted for it ; and also to enable this and the other Colonies to take from that
Fort	LOCATION	or Crown Point Such Stores as may be requisite for the defence of the Colonies , especially lead of which there is a great abundance .

		I have urged our
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to dispatch a Sloop we were obliged to buy , for Powder ; but as it is difficult to procure Gold & Silver or Bills of exchange , it will be necessary to Send provission with her , which in Some of the
Island	LOCATION	will facilitate the geting that article .

		But the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	wait your determination on the Trade .

		To prevent excuses for those whose Parsimony is very Criminal , and pretexes for false Brethren , I think it would be advancive of the
Public Service	ORGANIZATION	, were the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to pass a Resolution to enable us , to Send provission for amunition if we shall Judge it Necessary .

		.

		For there is not a moment to be lost in procuring this necessary Article .

		our all depends opon it .

		The Viper 's Conduct detained a Sloop we had ready here to dispatch for Powder 15 days ; and she is Soon to return .

		I therefore intreat you to get the opinion of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on this matter without delay , and if it Should be favourable dispatch it by express that we may expedite that Vessel before the return of the Viper .

		The intelligence from St
John	PERSON	's is to the 13th Instant , by Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Quackenboss	PERSON	of my Regt who is returned Sick .

		He Say that he left it the 13th , That the next morning a Battery of 2 Twelve , 2 Nine & 2 Six pounders was to be opened on the
East Side	LOCATION	of the River against
John	PERSON	's , which was to play on the Schooner & Galley of the Enemy .

		That the Ground on which the Battery is errected is much higher than that on which
St John	ORGANIZATION	's stand , in so much that the Battery would command the Parade of the Fort .

		That he Heard a very heavy canonade the 14th , which began at
Sun	LOCATION	rise and continued all the day , and commenced the next at sun rise ; and ceased all at once about 10 oClock .

		That the Troops were healthier than they had been and in good spirits ; That they had plenty of Provissions and latterly fresh .

		That one of our Bombs had fired a large House the
Principal Barrack	ORGANIZATION	in the Fort ; but was extinguished .

		This intelligence is confirmed by another Person .

		From all I have been able to Collect , the
Fort	LOCATION	is compleatly invested , and so near , that the beseigers can hear the Garrison Speak to each other .

		That they are not
Strongh	PERSON	enough to make any Sallies .

		So that if we do not Succeed , it must be for want of engirier 's , and amunition .

		For if these were well Supplied the place must have Surrender or been destroyed .

		Time will only permit me to add that I am with great Truth -LSB- & c. -RSB-

Asia	LOCATION	,
Somerset	LOCATION	, &
Boyne	LOCATION	be put out of the Question ー These Three
Shipps	PERSON	are ordered home and
Forty Gunn Shipps	ORGANIZATION	and downward are to be employed on the American Station for the future ー it is evident if they cruize in a Fleet they will not be formidable to Trade , and if single they will be liable to be attacked by an equall if not Superior force of the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	fleet ー
Connecticut	LOCATION	has fitted out Two &
Rhode Island Two	LOCATION	, these joining with the Two from the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and those which other Colonies & Individuals will fix for the Sea will go near , to form a Naval force equall if not Superior to what the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	will think of sending to
America	LOCATION	the Next season for they dream as little of Our meeting them , on the Sea as of Our invading
Canada	LOCATION	, and though their Naval power , & resources be ever so great in
Brittain	LOCATION	, they must inevitably be defeated the Next Campaign in
America	LOCATION	if We get early to Sea , these
Shipps	PERSON	, and with them surprize , & intercept their Transports , or any considerable part of them , this effected , the distance between
Us & Europe	ORGANIZATION	will put it out of their power to recover the blow , untill the season is over ー What will be the Loss to the Continent if these Vessels should be so unfortunate as to make no prizes ?

		ー I answer the Three Mo Wages and provisions will Amount to nearest one Third of the Gross Sum or sixty Thousand Dollars , and the ware & Tare will make up Ninety or one half which is a large Computation ー but if by means of this Force the Coastwise Trade only is protected to say Nothing of securing the introduction of Ammunition & c under their protection ー The freight of Flour only to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	will amount to a great part of the Sum , as every Barrel which they consume at present pays at least 12 Dollar Transportation more than if carried by Water 40,000 Barrels transported will save Sixty Thousand out of the Ninety Thousand Dollars and other Articles will doubtless Amount to as much more ー it is a fact that more than 40,000 Bls .

		of Flour have been consumed the present Season ー But the probability of Captures is much , in favor of the adventure The Transports unsuspecting danger will sail without Convoy every prize of this kind is of double advantage ー it weakens & disappoints the Enemy , strengthens & encourages Our Army ー It is good policy now to set on foot a Naval Force , under proper Regulations , & the reasons for it are ー At least Ten Thousand Seaman are thrown out of employ in the Northern Colonies ー these with their Owners , & the various mechanics , dependant on this extensive branch of Business can not possibly long rest easy , in their present destitute , distress 'd Situation , their Shipps rotting & their Families starving ー They will not revolt from the Cause but reprisal being justifiable as well by the Laws of Nature as of Nations , they will pursue the only method in their power for indemnifying themselves , and Reprisals will be made ー This will at best be but a kind of Justifiable piracy & subject to No Law or Rule the Consequences may be very pernicious ー The first fortunate Adventurer will set many more on pushing their Fortunes ー Is it not more prudent , where the Loss can , at most , be so trifling to Turn this Spirit , this Temper , this Necessity of the
Times	ORGANIZATION	down its right & proper Channel , and reduce it while in its infancy to Rule & Order before it become thro Want of Regulation , unmanageable .

		This will be , not only preventing , a Licentious roving , or piracy , but will be turning Our Enemies Weapons upon him ー Should private adventurers take up the Matter , every one will soon make his own Laws & in a few Years , No Law will govern , the mischief will grow rapidly & Our Own property will not be safe , ー Such Adventures are already desired upon , Witness , several Captures made by the provincials without order or direction ー This calls upon Us to be taken up & regulated at the first setting o -LSB- r -RSB- it will afterward be out of Our power Our Coasts will swarm with roving adventurers , who if they forbear plundering of Us or Our immediate Friends , may thro Necessity invade the property of the Subjects of those with whom We wish to stand well , & bring Accumulated Mischeif on these Colonies ー Can there be a scheme , or plan , by which , the above proposed , Naval Armament may be equipp 'd , without burthening these Colonies , or interfering with their other important & Necessary Operations ?

		I think there may , & therefore take leave to propose ー I .

		That a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of persons skill 'd in Maratime Affairs be Appointed to fitt for Sea with all possible dispatch the foregoing Vessels of
Warr	PERSON	that They have power to Commission proper persons to command the same and to Constitute such rules , Ordinances ; & directions as they shall judge best for the well regulating such Naval force , subject to the revision , & Alteration , of the
General Congress	ORGANIZATION	, or such board as they may hereafter appoint for that purpose ー Also to give the several Commanders from
Time	ORGANIZATION	to
Time	ORGANIZATION	such Instructions for their Conduct as they shall judge Necessary Subject to the Controll of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	ー II .

		This
Committee	ORGANIZATION	shall receive from the
Continental Treasury	ORGANIZATION	the Sum of in Bills emitted solely for that purpose & made redeemable as hereafter provided for , and that sd
Committee	ORGANIZATION	receive after the rate of p Cent on the Sums by them disbursed , in executing said Trust for the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	ー III .

		These Vessels shall cruise , only to protect the Trade of these Colonies from the insults of Ministerial Cutters ,
& Shipps of Warr	ORGANIZATION	, & for intercepting , & seizing such Vessels as shall be employed to
Transport Stores	ORGANIZATION	, or shall have Stores on board for the Ministerial Forces employed against these Colonies ー IV .

		The neat proceeds of all prizes after deducting the Shares of the Captors shall be by the Committee Accounted for to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, by them to be applied toward sinking the Bills emitted for that purpose ー all Convoy Mony , or for freight , shail be applied to the same purpose but of these the Officers & Seamen shall have no Share ー Whatever Stores , or Vessels , which on being found Useless for the present & shall be judged proper for Sale , they shall be sold for Gold , or Silver , or those Bills emitted for Naval purposes & the Neat -LSB- net -RSB- Amount of the Sales shall be applied to discharge & sink the Sum first Granted for these purposes V .

		The Vessels of
Warr	PERSON	already fitted out by any of these Colonies or Individuals or such as may hereafter be fitted out & shall join any part of the Fleet belonging to the Continent shall during their continuing with such Fleet or any part thereof be under the same Orders & Regulations as sd Fleet are , & be subject to the Directions of the cheif Commander of the
Continental Fleet	ORGANIZATION	then present , and all prizes taken , they or any of them present , & assisting ー shall be divided by the proportion of Gunns & Men in the respective
Shipps	PERSON	or Vessels present ー VI .

		That the first Commissioned Captain be stiled Commodore and be considered as , & have the powers of a Commander in Chief , under the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, or sd
Committee	ORGANIZATION	over sd Fleet ー I have now run over the outlines of a Naval Establishment , the
American Exchequer	ORGANIZATION	, may have No Money to spare , for such an Adventure ー That is not the Question ー is it Necessary , if so , let Us look for Ways , & Means , I would have the Money , struck for the use of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, be kept as a distinct affair , & the Bills be sunk , or discharged independant of other Concerns .

		ー if there should be any prizes they will help to pay off the Bills , The Sales of the Vessels , after the Cruize , if the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should not incline to keep it longer , in pay , will go farr in paying off the Bills .

		Suppose to make out the One half only , it is very probable , that selling , even at this discount with the Convoy Money , Freight & prizes , that the whole will be discharged ー but in case this should fail & the whole at the end of Three Mo be sunk , will not the forcing Our Enemy to keep their Naval force collected in a Fleet give such a free access to Vessels bringing the Stores We want , be an advantage adequate To this Sum ?

		I think it will & more ー The Bills emitted should be paid off in three annual payments , and suppose to render the payment certain without burthening the public it be , by Three annual Lotteries , in which Case , whatever the Fleet may bring in , may be applied to the repairing of it , & increasing , if Necessary This will take off all popular Objection in point of expences ー The Continent may be alarmed , at an additional expence , if a
Navy	ORGANIZATION	be set on foot at
Continental Charge	ORGANIZATION	, but a provision for sinking the Bills , by Lottery , will burthen no one , and it can be done with the greatest Certainty , by putting the Lottery , in effect , into Three Classes obliging the fortunate Adventurers in the first to receive a certain Number of Tickets in the Second in payment , in proportion To The Value of the prizes drawn , by which , a Sale will be insured , of so large a part of the next that the drawing will be punctually complied with ー Estimate made At -LSB-

		MEMORIAL OF THE CAPTAINS OF THE
PENNSYLVANIA	LOCATION	GALLEYS To the Honourable the
Committee of Safety The Memorial	ORGANIZATION	of the Captains employed in the
Provincial Armed Boats	ORGANIZATION	humbly sheweth ー That they do not presume , nor would they by any means be understood by any One , to presume to dictate to them , whom they apprehend to have the sole Power of appointing any Gentleman they may think proper to the chief
Command of the Armed Boats	ORGANIZATION	, 2 yet they hope that they will be allowed , without giving the least Offence to any One of the
Honourable Board	ORGANIZATION	, to offer a few things in their own Behalf ; but would first observe , that it is not out of any dislike or disaffection to the Person , Character or Abilities , of the Gentleman it is reported will be appointed to that
Command	ORGANIZATION	, but purely to vindicate their own Characters & Honour , from any unjust Aspersions , that may be thrown upon them by Persons out of Doors , who may be entirely ignorant of the Matter or Cause of it ー therefore they would observe ー 1st That when the Gentlemen who are honoured with the Command of those Boats first entered into the Service , it must be obvious to all , that it could not be out of any lucrative Views , but solely to serve the common Cause as far as lay in their power , & fondly hope their Conduct as yet , has not been blamed or disapproved off by any of your Board ー 2d That ever since their Appointment they have found the greatest Harmony to subsist among the Officers & Men belonging to all the Boats , untill the other Night , when laying at the
Island	LOCATION	, on hearing the Report of a Commodore , who had not before belonged to any of the Boats , to be appointed , they conceive they have now some Cause to believe it will not long remain so among the Crews , tho ' at same time they assure the Honourable Board , they will use every Endeavour to prevent any murmuring in their respective Boats ー 3d They are of Opinion that there may be some of the Gentlemen already belonging to the Boats , who may be equally as well qualified for the Command , as perhaps many that can now be found in the Places , & were in hopes , that the eldest Captain would be appointed to the Command , & in Case of Removal by Death or otherwise , to be succeeded by the next eldest in Command , except found undeserving , which they apprehend to be the general
Custom	ORGANIZATION	in the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and are of Opinion it would tend to excite a Spirit of Bravery and Emulation among the Officers .

		ー but this they humbly submitt to the Determination of the Board ー Gentlemen ー We have already declared & must again repeat it , that the incontestable Right of appointing to any Command in the Armed Boats , must & does belong to you , and that we never had any the least Intention in presenting this our undigested Memorial , drawn up in a Hurry , & in many Parts incorrect & imperfect , to give the least Umbrage or Offence , to any Gentleman of your Honourable Board , but only to pray if it is not already too late , & that it can be done with Propriety , that you will be pleased to reconsider our Case ー We are Gentlemen -LSB- & c. -RSB- Philada October the 30th 1775 H

		NARRATIVE OF CAPTAIN
ANDREW SNAPE HAMOND	PERSON	, R.N. -LSB-
Halifax	LOCATION	, October 31 , 1775 -RSB- 1775 ー The Rebellion in
America	LOCATION	growing more serious , and all hopes of bringing them back to their allegiance , otherwise than by force of arms , being at an end ; The Ministry in the beginning of July came to a resolution to send out a considerable reinforcement of Troops & Ships to
Boston	LOCATION	; In consequence of which I was appointed to command The Roebuck , a new Ship lately built at
Chatham	LOCATION	carrying 44 Guns .

		I sailed from
England	LOCATION	about the Midle of September , and after stopping a few days at
Guernsey	LOCATION	, a week at Fayal -LRB- one of the
Western Islands	LOCATION	, which in a great measure recoverd me out of a dangerous fever -RRB- , I arrived at
Halifax	LOCATION	in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, in order to land
Comodore Arbuthnot	PERSON	-LRB- who was appointed commander in chief in that Port and Commissioner of the Dock Yard there -RRB- on the 31st of October .

		I should from thence have proceeded imediately to
Boston	LOCATION	, but as it was well known that a large body of the Rebels had marched into
Canada	LOCATION	, and a probability that if they did not succeed there they might attempt to destroy the Dock Yard at
Halifax	LOCATION	, Mr
Arbuthnot	PERSON	, who had also a
Commission	ORGANIZATION	to command the Ships in the
Harbour	LOCATION	, thought proper to detain me , as well as the Somerset Captain Le cras for the better security of the Place ; and it was certainly most necessary as at that time there were not above 300 Land forces in the Garrison .

General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, having the most grateful Sense of our Sovereigns paternal Regard for all his faithful People , and particularly in the distinguish 'd favors lately granted to the Inhabitants of this Province , and such as seek an Asylum therein from the other Colonies : Think it our duty to lay before your Excellency the Discouragement the trading part of the People meet with in their Commerce with
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the
West India Islands	LOCATION	, and also the Coasting Trade , by having their Seamen and other persons employ 'd by them in that Business , impress 'd and put on Board Ships of War which unless spedily prevented must utterly ruin the small Trade of this Province and deprive His Majesty 's Subjects in the
West Indies	LOCATION	of that supply of Lumber and other necessary Articles which they would otherwise be furnish 'd with from hence , and has a Tendency to prevent many well Affected persons from coming into the Province from the other Colonies which the Government at home seem desirous to encourage ; and tho we are willing to contribute all in our Power at this time for the
Aid & Assistance of His Majesty 's Forces	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	, we can not but feel for the distress 'd State of Numbers in the Town of
Halifax	LOCATION	, on Account of the Scarcity of Fuel , and other necessary Supplies of which they will be deprived in a great Measure from the dread the Persons are under of being impress 'd , who usually furnish 'd the Town therewith .

		We therefore Request your Excellency will please to represent to His Majesty & Ministers , the Distresses , if not total ruin of the Trade of this Province , where but few Seamen are to be had , should the practice of empressing them for the Ships of War be continued : That an Order may be procur 'd from the Lords of the Admiralty to put a Stop thereto : In the mean time we pray your Excellency woud use your Influence with the Admiral at
Boston	LOCATION	and the Commanders of such of His Majesty 's Ships as are now in the Harbour of
Halifax	LOCATION	, or may resort hither , that the Seamen belonging to Vessels owned in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	may not be impress 'd .

JOSIAH QUINCY	PERSON	TO GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION
Braintree Octo	ORGANIZATION	31 1775 .

		May it please your Excellency , My worthy and dear Friend
Doctr -LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Franklin	PERSON	, the Honble Mr -LSB-
James -RSB- Bowdoin	PERSON	,
Doctr -LSB- James -RSB- Winthrop	PERSON	, and Doctr -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Cooper	PERSON	, were , the last Week , so kind as to honour me with a friendly Visit : ー The Conversation naturally turned , upon the savage Cruelty we are dayly suffiering , from the unrelenting Vengeance of a tyrannical Government : In the Course of it , the stoping up the
Harbor of Boston	ORGANIZATION	, as one salutary Measure , was thought well worthy the Attention of our State Pilots ; and upon my saying I had once , if not more than once hinted the Scheme to your Excellency , they desired me to communicate my Sentiments to you , once more , in writing ; especially , as I had lately received , a Letter from to honble J :
Adams Esqr	PERSON	in
Phildia	LOCATION	, in Answer to one of mine , which seemed to throw new Light upon the Subject : This , Sir , I beg may be a sufficient Apology for transmitting to you the following Extracts of those Letters ; with what has further occurred to my Mind , since they were wrote .

		ー In my Letter I thus write ... In my former Letter I said , '' `` the Harbor might be blocked up , and both Seamen & Soldiers made Prisoners at Discretion , '' '' which seems to you incredible : ー Please to read , at your Leasure the following Explanation : ー There are but two Channels , through which ships of Burthen can safely pass , to and from
Boston	LOCATION	: ー One of them runs , between the west Head of
Long Island	LOCATION	and the Moon , -LRB- so called -RRB- and is about a mile across : This is too shallow for any Ship of War above 20 Guns : ー The Other is called the Ship Channel , and runs between the east Head of
Long Island	LOCATION	, and the
south Point of Deer Island	LOCATION	; and is something better than a Mile from Side to Side : This , the only
Channel	ORGANIZATION	through which capital Ships can pass , leads , outward bound , through the Narrows , between
Gallops Isld	LOCATION	and
Lovels Island	LOCATION	, where the Channel is not wider than the Length of a 50 gun Ship : ー In the Opening between
Gallops Isld & Georges Isld	ORGANIZATION	is
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	; where one Frigate is always stationed to gaurd the Narrows from being stoped up .

		ー Upon these Facts I thus reason .

		The
Moon Island	LOCATION	communicates at low Water with
Squantum Neck	LOCATION	, almost dry shod : A defensible fort therefore , may be so placed upon
Squantum	LOCATION	, as to cover the Retreat not only from the Moon , but from
Squantum	LOCATION	to the Main .

		One upon the east Head of the Moon , and another on the west Head of
Long Island	LOCATION	, secures that Passage , and covers the Retreat from the Latter to the Former .

		Another upon the Summit in the middle of
Long Island	LOCATION	, covers the Shore on both Sides , so as that no Force can land without being greatly annoyed , if not intirely prevented .

		ー Another strong Fort , with heavy Cannon , at the east Head of
Long Isld	LOCATION	, would command , not only the Ship Channel that runs by it , but the Narrows and
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	, so that no Ship could remain there with Safety , and consequently , we might by sinking Hulks in the Narrows , prevent , any Ship of Force from going out or coming in .

		ー If the Passage through the Narrows is not stoped , I am sensible , that a Ship , with a fresh Gale of Wind and flood Tide , which is rapid between
Long Island	LOCATION	and
Deer Island	LOCATION	, might run through without any great Hazard : But , after the east Head of
Long Island	LOCATION	is fortified , I can forsee Nothing to hinder the Narrows being reduced , to such a Depth of Water , as that no
Vessel of Force	ORGANIZATION	can pass through there : This being effected , as I said above , both Seamen and Soldiers , if they dont escape , by a timely Flight , must become Prisoners at Discretion .

		I have been told there is in one of the late English Magazines , an accurate Draft of the Harbor , which upon Examination will enable you to determine , with Precision , the Bearings & Distances from
Island	LOCATION	to
Island	LOCATION	, and the Depth of Water between them ; and consequently , whether such a Scheme is practicable or not .

		Mr
Adams	PERSON	, in Answer writes thus .

		I am much obliged by your kind Explanation of your Opinion that the Harbor might be blocked up .

		ー I must confess , altho I was born so near it , I never understood before the Course of the Channel , and the Situation of the
Harbor	LOCATION	so well .

		ー I have carefully compared your Discription of
Squantum	LOCATION	, the Moon ,
Long Island	LOCATION	,
Gallop 's Island	LOCATION	,
Lovel 's Island	LOCATION	, and
George	PERSON	's ; the Narrows and
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	, with `` A Plan of the Town and Chart of the
Harbor of Boston	ORGANIZATION	, exhibiting a View of the
Islands	LOCATION	, Castle Fort , and Entrances into the said
Harbor	LOCATION	, which was published in
London	LOCATION	last February . ''

		This Plan I knew to be inaccurate in some Particulars , and the Chart may be so in others : but by the best Judgment I can make upon comparing your Facts with the Chart , and considering the Depth -LSB- s -RSB- of Water marked on this Chart , I think it extremely probable with you , that Nothing but Powder & Cannon are wanting , to effect the important Purposes you mention , that of making Soldiers & Sailors Prisoners at Discretion .


Doctr Franklin	PERSON	's Row Gallies are in great forwardness : seven of them are completely manned armed , & ca I went down the River the other Day with all of them .

		I have as much Confidence in them as you have .

		* ー But the People here have made Machines to be sunk in the Channel of
Delaware River	LOCATION	.

		Three Rowes of them are placed in the River , with large Timbers barbed with Iron .

		They are frames of Timber sunk with Stone ー Machines very proper , for our Channel in the Narrows .


Doctr Franklin	PERSON	says they may be made in the Form of a Chevaux de Frize and used to great Advantage .

		I have wrote to Mr
Adams	PERSON	for a Model of the Machines he mentions , with explicit Directions how to sink and secure them from being weighed or destroyed by the
Enemies Ships	ORGANIZATION	.

		For my own Part , since I have read what my Friend has wrote , I am more than ever convinced , of the Practicability of not only securing the
Harbour	LOCATION	, but relieving the Town of
Boston	LOCATION	, by making the present Possessors of it our Prisoners ; and that without shedding much more human Blood , provided we can once possess & fortify long-Island .

		I doubt not , your Excellency will readily agree with me , that these are become objects of much greater Importance , since the Destruction of
Falmouth	LOCATION	demonstrates , the malicious Resolution of our barbarously civilized Enemies , to destroy all the rest of our Maritime Towns , if they can .

		If your Excellency should think the above Sentiments worthy of your Attention , and for maturing your Judgment , conclude it necessary to take an ocular View of the
Harbour	LOCATION	and
Islands	LOCATION	; please to accept of my cordial Invitation , to refresh or repose your Self at my
House	ORGANIZATION	; where my Happiness will be in Proportion to the Freedom with which you receive the friendly Salutations of your Excellency 's , -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Jos	PERSON	a
Quincy	ORGANIZATION	ー * I had wrote largely to Mr.
Adams	PERSON	upon the subject , but have not copied it , for fear of being tedious .

		JOURNAL OF THE

Providence	LOCATION	, on Tuesday the 31st day of October , 1775 Whereas , the town council of the town of
Newport	LOCATION	, presented a memorial to this Assembly , setting forth the distressed situation of the town , occasioned by the withholding from the ministerial fleet , stationed in the harbor of
Newport	LOCATION	, their usual supplies of fresh beef , beer , & c. ; in consequence of which , the ferry boats , market boats , fish boats and wood vessels , are prevented from coming to the town with their usual supplies of provisions and fuel , for the use of the inhabitants ; by means , whereof , together with a stagnation of trade , they are now exposed to all those dreadful consequences which must inevitably arise through the want of the common necessaries of life .

		COUNT DE GUINES TO COUNT DE VERGENNES -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 11 August 1775 No. 288 I can only approve , Sir , your views on
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		You understand what goes on and you cunningly anticipate what will happen as if you were there ; a destroyed or worthless
America	LOCATION	is what
England	LOCATION	seeks .

		I agree with you , Sir , and it is in this line of thought that the Council of the King must face the present events and determine its plans for the future .

		I do not doubt for one moment , from what I overheard among the Ministers of the King of
England	LOCATION	, that the decision has been made at the Council of this Prince to annihilate
America	LOCATION	if they can not subdue her , to burn the cities , the ships , the forests and to turn this country into a desert .

		This plan would be carried out in a spirit of revenge and out of spite ; it would even be the outcome of a barbaric policy indeed , but the only one which in the present situation could serve the interest of
England	LOCATION	, since it is established that henceforth
America	LOCATION	will hardly be her slave , never her ally , and for ever her enemy .

		This principle must govern all the resolutions which will be adopted by this power ... We have received no interesting news from
Boston	LOCATION	unless it has been made a secret .

		The Ministers claim that they received letters dated on the 27th of June and that at that time nothing had happened since to
Charles Town	PERSON	affair .

		I am certain that they will stand on the defensive until next year and I would not be surprised if that campaign began in
New York	LOCATION	since
Boston	LOCATION	is some sort of a box of which it is very difficult to come out .

		But what an enormous expense for
England	LOCATION	!

		A considerable sum of money will have to be voted during the next session of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and it will hardly be less expensive for
England	LOCATION	to wage war on her Colonies than on
France	LOCATION	.

		This comparison of facts should become the subject matter of important discussions .

Versailles	LOCATION	, 13 August 1775 No. 148 I had the honor , Sir , to receive your letter No. 287 which you wrote to me on the 4th of the month .

		If the letter which I sent you on the seventh reached you before you had a meeting with Lord
Rochford	PERSON	, it will have explained to you that we can wait with patience for a satisfactory agreement on our rights in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	2 and that , while we do not intend to lose sight of this affair , we do not wish to place upon it an emphasis which might dispose the British Ministry to believe that we are trying to take advantage of their difficulties and force them into a compromise .

		It is not the King 's intention to place the Ministry in jeopardy since it already occupies a most unstable position ; were it possible , we Would make every effort in order to support it rather than strive to overthrow it .

		Once and for all , Sir , proceed with the negotiations , but use enough moderation so that neither Lord
Rochford	PERSON	nor any of his colleagues may presume that we are attempting to embarass them personally .

		Our cause is fair , our right is established and the evidence is in our favor .

		We demand that our rights to make use of the Coast of
Bonavista	LOCATION	as defined in the peace-treaty of Utrecht be restored or that we be granted a suitable equivalent .

		It will not be long before we know if the British suffered a defeat in
America	LOCATION	; it is to the insurgents ' advantage to make their advances known and they certainly were able to find a way by which to spread such news .

		The expedition of fine Regiments of the division of
Ireland	LOCATION	to which three Cavalry regiments might be added proves that the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	deems necessary to make the greatest efforts to maintain their position in that country and take command of the situation .

		I would think , Sir , that such would be the intention of the Ministry if the sending of these three
Cavalry Regiments	ORGANIZATION	were verified ; this kind of troops would be most awkward and quite useless , should they wish to insult our
Islands	LOCATION	and conquer them .

		However , the more the British increase their forces in that part of the World , the more we must guard against any harmful use they might be tempted to make of them .

		Anything is to be feared on the part of a Nation which behaves more often out of despair than on a matter of principle .

		... What is essential for us is that we be informed in time of the movements in the ports .

		It would seem difficult to suspect the
British Ministry	ORGANIZATION	.

		of scheming against their neighbours as long as they limit their armaments to ships of fifty cannons , frigates and corvettes .

Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	from
Naples	LOCATION	or any of His Sicilian Majesty 's Dominions to the
British Colonies	ORGANIZATION	in

		The Marquis answer 'd that He was very sure that His Sicilian Majesty wou 'd be happy upon this , as upon every other occasion , to give a proof of His Friendship and Esteem for His Britannic Majesty , and made no doubt but that He shou 'd be authorized to acquaint me very soon , that the necessary Orders had been issued to prevent the above mention 'd Exportation .

		I have made the most diligent enquiry and do not believe that any
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	have been as yet exported from these Kingdoms to our Colonies in
America	LOCATION	.

		There are
Newfoundland	LOCATION	Ships that come here every Season with
Baccala	PERSON	, and I have known a Ship or two come here directly from
New York	LOCATION	, but very rarely .

		Your Lordship may be assured that I shall be particularly attentive that His Majesty 's desire may be strictly complied with , the only danger is from the Counterband which the French carry on in Small Vessels upon the extended Coast of these Kingdoms , and indeed the
Marquis Tanucci	PERSON	hinted to me the frequency of such Counterbands as well as the difficulty of preventing them , hoping that if any such accident shou 'd happen , in the present case , it might not be attributed to this Government , who wou 'd certainly take every measure to prevent it .

		I return Your Lordship many thanks for the Gazette with the account of the defeat of a party of the Rebels in
America	LOCATION	, I trust in God that these unfortunate and deluded people will soon be brought to a just sense of their crimes , and submit again to the mild Government of the Mother Country , the time value of which they do not seem to have known .

		LORD SANDWICH TO VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES Private .

		Admiralty , 25th August 1775 .

		Dear Sir , ー As you will now have a very great naval force under your command , and as the eyes of all the world are now fixed on your operations , I think it incumbent upon me to speak freely to you , and to tell you the general opinion of mankind here with regard to the state of affairs in
America	LOCATION	.

		The nation -LRB- except some factious and interested opponents -RRB- are in a manner unanimous in their resolution to crush the unnatural rebellion that has broke out in
America	LOCATION	by force of arms , which to our great concern we find now to be the only expedient left ; and as I have told you in former letters , you will be liable to universal censure for doing too little , though I should be greatly surprised if you incurred any blame by rather overdoing your part in the other extreme .

		I think I should not perform the part of a friend , if I endeavoured to conceal from you that the world in general has been full of complaints that the fleet does nothing ; and that in particular fresh provisions are wanted at
Boston	LOCATION	, which the ships have it in their power to procure : they say that you do not consider the rebellious colonies as a people you are actually at war with ; and that though they take every advantage in their power in order to starve the navy and army , you seem to have delicacies about taking possession of whatever is wanted for subsistence or in aid of your operations .

		Though this language is chiefly in the mouths of those who are unacquainted with your force and of the extensive services that your fleet is to be employed in , yet still the idea of your doing too little has been so prevalent that it is with great difficulty that I have been able to resist the general cry for another commander .

		I have however resisted it hitherto ; and I am persuaded that you will give me fresh materials before the end of the campaign to confirm what I have asserted , namely that you will exert every nerve in support of the important business you are engaged in .

		You are going to be greatly reinforced and to have a very able rear-admiral 2 to command under you ; with that assistance , I think you will soon show the rebels the weight of an English fleet .

		If ー we had any bomb-vessels ready , I should send them out directly , as I imagine they may be of use ; at all events , you shall have a couple early in the spring .

		Whatever wants you may have , let us know them , and you may be assured you shall be supplied liberally , as there is not the least intention of starving the cause .

		It is impossible to think of directing your particular operations here ; but it occurs to me that with a fleet that is master of the sea and with so large a number of transports ready to convey troops to any part of the continent , a diversion might be made to the southward which would embarrass your opponents and take them unprepared : I own I should be very happy to hear that such a plan was in agitation , and have no doubt but that you would give it every kind of encouragement .

		I have always understood that
Rhode Island	LOCATION	and other places in rebellion are open to the sea and have plenty of cattle and stock .

		I think by means of your fleet you might contrive to force them to supply your : wants .

		However , as I have already said , I do not pretend to point out any particular operations , I only mean to perform the duty of a friend by holding out to your view the rock you may split upon and by laying open the channel through which it may be avoided .

		I am -LSB- & c. -RSB- Sandwich 1 .

		I thought it was all the more necessary to insist on this point because I know for a fact that a British frigate seized a ship sent to

		Sir , After having , in my Separate Letter of this day 's date said so much upon the ideas which have been adopted of the great risque & little advantage that are to be expected from the
Army	ORGANIZATION	continuing at
Boston	LOCATION	during the Winter season , unless a more favourable
Prospect	ORGANIZATION	opens , & having also repeatedly suggested the advantages of recovering possession of
New York	LOCATION	, I have nothing to add upon those material Objects of your consideration ; but as it is of very great Importance that you should know upon what ground we entertain a confident hope of having a large
Army	ORGANIZATION	in
North America	LOCATION	in the Spring , I should be unpardonable if I did not acquaint you that His Majesty 's Minister at
Petersburgh	LOCATION	having been instructed to sound the Empress , how far she would be disposed , in case of necessity , to assist His Majesty with such Force as the state & security of the Empire would admit ;
Her Imperial Majesty	ORGANIZATION	has , in the fullness of her affection for the
British Nation	ORGANIZATION	, & of gratitude for the benefits she received under her late difficulties , made the most explicit declaration , & given the most ample Assurances , of letting us have any number of Infantry that may be wanted .

		In consequence of this generous and magnanimous Offer , a Requisition has been made for Twenty Thousand Men , & it is proposed to send the greatest part of the Auxiliaries , as early as possible in the Spring to
Quebec	LOCATION	; And I trust we shall have at least an equal number of British Troops in
North America	LOCATION	to act with them , if Occasion requires .

Fredk Town	LOCATION	and that you suffer 'd so much in getting home from thence , But this Cursed Scheme of business we are engaged in conducted upon the Plan it has , and attended with the difficulties which have Attended it , is enought to kill us all , and will in my Opinion do it yet , before we have done with it ; for my own part I now find , I scarce knew what Trouble was , before the difficulties of my Situation in business here , made me Acquainted with it , and since that time I have known little else , to the destroying of my Health as well as the ruining of my peace and quiet , However it Availeth not to complain , and this I ought to know full well from experience , but at sometimes it is a hard matter to be silent ー .

PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	TO VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES Sir -LSB-
Admiralty Office	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- 6th Sepr 1775 I have received and communicated to my Lords Commissrs of the Admty your Letters of the 16th & 18th of July , giving account of your proceedings up to that time ; And in return I have the satisfaction to acquaint you that their Lordships very well approve thereof .

		Their Lordships had previous to the receipt of the abovementioned Letters , signified to Capt.
Montagu	PERSON	, their approbation of his having sent to
England	LOCATION	the
Magdalen Schooner	ORGANIZATION	with Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	's dispatches , as they were represented to him to be , and really were of great importance : But their Lordships command me to acquaint you that they entirely concur with you in opinion that it is a precedent which ought not to be drawn into practise ; and that no part of your
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	should at any time be sent to
England	LOCATION	at the requisition of any of the Governors of His Majts Colonies , without your orders , unless the service be of a very pressing nature and no Vessel can be hired in which an Officer might carry dispatches not safe to be trusted with the Master ; And their Lordships recommend it to you to signify the same to the respective Officers of your
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	; They having on their part desired the Earl of
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	to take the Kings pleasure for writing to the several Governors to the same effect : The Lizard sailed from
Spithead	LOCATION	the 16th Ultimo , with the
Jacob Storeship	PERSON	laden with Arms and
Military Cloathing & Stores for Quebec	ORGANIZATION	, as did the Actaeon from the Downs on the 24th with the
Maria Storeship	PERSON	, laden in like manner for
Virginia	LOCATION	; But the latter -LRB- the Actaeon -RRB- having unfortunately struck upon the Shingles it will be necessary to examine her bottom before she proceeds to Sea .

		Their Lordships have therefore ordered the
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	to convoy the
Maria Storeship	PERSON	to
Virginia	LOCATION	, and perform the Service , specified in the inclosed Copy of her Orders , instead of the Actaeon , which will have her damages made good , and be sent to join you at
Boston	LOCATION	as soon as possible .

		The Roebuck is ready and will sail with the first opportunity of Wind & Weather to
Halifax	LOCATION	with Commissioner
Arbuthnot	PERSON	, and from thence as soon as she has landed him , to
Boston	LOCATION	; The Centurion , Experiment & Renown , and some others of the Ships mentioned in my last Letters are in great forwardness and will soon follow .

		My Lords have since I wrote to you last ordered the
Boreas & Triton	ORGANIZATION	of 20 Guns each , to be fitted out to join you .

		And it is their intention to send two more 50 Gunships , two Bombs , and as many more Frigates as can conveniently be got ready to reinforce you early in the Spring .

		When these Reinforcements arrive , you will have a very numerous Fleet under your command , Their Lordships therefore recommend it to you in the mean time to consider and to let them know as soon as you have an opportunity , whether the addition of an Hospital Ship , will be of advantage to the Service and if you think it will , whether any of the Transports at
Boston	LOCATION	can be fitted for that purpose , and whether you have a sufficient number of Surgeons , or Surgeon 's Mates to put on board her , or what supply of them you shall want to have sent from hence Their Lordships taking into consideration the difficulties of obtaining fresh Provisions for the Crews of the Ships under your command , as well as for the men who may be sick in the Hospital , have directed the
Commissrs for Sick & Hurt Seamen	ORGANIZATION	to send to
Boston	LOCATION	by the first opportunity , Five Thousand Pounds weight of Portable Soup , consigned to you , to be served on board the Squadron to the men in health , as well as those who may be sick as you shall have occasion ; Their Lordships have also directed them to send One Thousand Pounds Weight of the said Soup for the use of the Hospital at
Boston	LOCATION	, and Two hundred Pounds weight for the use of the Marine Infirmary there .

		Their Lordships moreover intend to order the Commissrs for Victualing to send from time to time to
Boston	LOCATION	, a Vessel laden with Potatoes & Carrots for the use of the Fleet , And they recommend it to you to consider whether it might not contribute greatly to the keeping the men in health if you were to send at proper seasons a sm2.ll Vessel to the
Bahama Islands	LOCATION	for Turtles , Oranges ,
Limes & Shaddocks	ORGANIZATION	, & such other refreshments , as may be procured there .

		My dear Lord ー I know you are so zealous in our cause against the American rebels that I should not act with that confidence I have in you , if I concealed from you the bitter complaints that have come home against Admiral
Graves	PERSON	.

		Officers of distinction have written a state of facts that can not be contradicted : such as , that many of our vessels have been taken , officers killed , men made prisoners ; that a great number of swift boats called whale-boats have been supplied to the enemy from well-known towns on the coast , in which boats they have insulted and plundered islands immediately under the protection of our ships , and at noonday landed in force and burned the lighthouse almost under the guns of two or three men of war .

		The officers who write this ask where an excuse can be found for not enforcing instant restitution and reparation , or laying the towns in ashes where boats had been furnished , privateers fitted out , prizes carried in , or provisions refused .

		These are heavy charges , and I confess I do not see how they can be answered .

		The King , who is apprised of all this , has authorized me to tell you that he does not see , after every letter laying such blame on him -LRB- the Admiral -RRB- , how the command can any longer be left in such improper hands .

		You will forgive me writing thus confidentially : we both mean with active zeal to promote the cause in which we are embarked ; I am confident , therefore , that you will listen to any proposal that will m the smallest degree tend to forward the service .

EDMUND BURKE	PERSON	TO LORD ROCKINGHAM -LSB- Extract -RSB- I observed , that one main Cause of the supine negligence of several principal Traders , was this .

		They had formed a confused opinion , that things would come of themselves to an amicable settlement .

		They have been so often alarmed , that many of them can not believe the present troubles to be any thing more than an alarm .

		On this delusive supposition , they go on filling their Warehouses with Goods , exhausting their Capital to the last farthing , and even borrowing upon Interest wherever they can borrow .

		They say that this is the third non-importation agreement of the North Americans .

		That the two former had broken up much to the advantage of the Merchants , and particularly the second .

		They had then a demand with twenty per Cent , advance , on every thing ; which paid them amply for the delay .

		They even sold at that advanced price , goods of such a quality , as at other times they could not sell at any price at all .

		Mr Bull , one of the greatest dealers in
Bristol	LOCATION	, and who alone employs four hundred men , has not actually dismissed so many as fifty ; the rest he employs at half and quarter work , as it is called , in hopes , which at length begin to fail him , that a reconciliation will take place .

		He is fearful , that if he should now dismiss them in a body , that he may not be able to recover them on the return of the Trade .

		For my part my apprehensions are , that from their irresolute and dodging motions , the evil will be gradual and therefore incurable .

		The Merchants in that Trade will break , after the manufacturers have perished insensibly , and melted down without Notice into the mass of the National Wretchedness .

		But this , in my opinion may be in some sort prevented , if but one tenth part of the pains are taken to shew them their danger , which have been , and are employd to keep them quiet by false representations and delusive hopes .

Stormont	ORGANIZATION	2 intends soon to return to
Paris	LOCATION	, I shall fully discuss every point of business with His Lordship that relates to the Court where you reside and for that reason there is less occasion for my writing to you at present so particularly thereon as I otherwise should do , but I can not defer mentioning to you the general Opinion entertained here that the American Rebels are constantly assisted by the french Nation as well from
Europe	LOCATION	as from their
American Islands	LOCATION	.

		I could not avoid taking notice of it last week to
Count de Guines	ORGANIZATION	, and confirmed it to him afterwards in a note to which I received answer as you will see by the inclosed copy .

		It is probable that the
Count de Vergennes	ORGANIZATION	may think it necessary to repeat to You the same assurances the french Ambassador here is persuaded he shall have Orders to give , but whether
Monsr de Vergennes	PERSON	speaks to you or not upon that subject , it is highly proper you should tell him that Advice has been received from the Post Master at
New York	LOCATION	that upwards of thirty Tons of Gunpowder were arrived at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	sent thither by the french Governor of
S. Domingo	PERSON	.

		If private Men for the sake of Profit had been engaged in such a business , it would not have caused the same sensation here but it must easily occur to
Monsr de Vergennes	LOCATION	that when a french Governor acts in that manner , it can not but convey very different Ideas , and therefore The King makes full reliance that the Court of france without delay will cause the necessary Inquiries to be made about it , and renew such Orders as there is reason to expect in consequence of their repeated friendly Declarations .

		WILLIAM LEE TO
RICHARD HENRY LEE	PERSON	-LSB-
London	LOCATION	-RSB- 22 September , 1775 .

		I am afraid the most wicked machinations of Governor
Dunmore	PERSON	have by this time involved you in the horrors of war .

		What the Ministry intend against you and the rest of
America	LOCATION	, can not be exactly ascertained before the meeting of the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		Probably they have not yet determined upon the exact mode of executing their vengeance .

		You will do wisely , however , in preparing for the utmost extremity that the most unprincipled and deepest revenge can suggest .

		It is said , and I believe with truth , that the war is to be carried into
Virginia	LOCATION	, as well as in the northern Provinces , next spring .

		This winter will be employ 'd in providing every means that can shield you from the destruction to which your merciless enemies have destined you .

		Some precautions will be taken , relative to your Negroes .

		Some fortifications , in the places by nature most inaccessible , for Magazines and Refuge will be made .

		Can not the Capes , by the co-operation of the two Colonies , be rendered impassable ?

		Should not alarm Houses be erected there as well as the mouths of the Rivers ?

		No precautions can be too great against the dangers that threaten you , especially as no one can tell what foreign foes , taking the advantage of the present state of things , may invade you .

		The utmost industry of the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	is employed to inflame men 's minds here , especially by publishing General
Gage	PERSON	's accusations of savageness and barbarity in carrying on the war on the part of the Provincials .

		These accusations , like those of -LSB-
Francis -RSB- Bernard	PERSON	and -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Hutchinson	PERSON	, are made in such general terms , as admit not of a specific refutation , and in a general denial , his word is more like to gain credit than that of those he accuses .

		Whatever may be the real sentiments of People here in this question , it is not easy to conceive more quietism than prevails in general .

		The interested on each side declare themselves , but the bulk of the Nation is perfectly silent .

		We therefore see the Jacobites and Nonjurors addressing for coercive measures , the Merchants and Manufacturers petitioning for conciliation , while the Counties and large Cities in general -LRB-
London	LOCATION	excepted -RRB- , remain unmovd .

		The increase of taxes , which another year 's continuance of violent measures must produce , will excite much clamour , which will not be diminished by the interruption of
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our good friends at
Glasgow	LOCATION	, are by their Agents here endeavoring to procure a proposition from the Merchants , in conjunction with them , to supply Administration with Money for carrying on the war , provided the forfeited lands in
America	LOCATION	are secured to them .

		This money is what the Virginians chiefly have supplied them with , in contemplation of the approaching troubles , by treble Remittances .

		This is Scotch gratitude .

		Thirty thousand men , is said to be the Estimate of the whole force intended against
America	LOCATION	, next year ; and indeed it is difficult to conceive , where troops and taxes will be found for such an
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		Wherever the storm falls it will be heavy .

		But that such a force can shake one Province , much less the whole Continent , is to me incredible .

		I am afraid a total disconnexion between the two Countries will be the consequence of these hostile measures .

		Common danger , however , if it should occur , would unite them again .

		The ensuing Session of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, will decide whether we are to have actual War or not .

		For should opposition be stronger and in earnest , I can not but think the calamities we dread will yet be prevented .

		By
Archibald Cockburn	PERSON	, Esq ; of
Cockpen	LOCATION	, Advocate , his Majesty 's Sheriff
Depute of the Sheriff	PERSON	dom of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		Whereas a letter was received by me some time ago , from his Majesty 's Advocate for
Scotland	LOCATION	, intimating , That on account of the present rebellion in
America	LOCATION	, it was proper a stop should be put for the present to emigrations to that country ; and that the necessary directions were left at the different sea-ports in
Scotland	LOCATION	to that purpose : I think it my duty , in obedience to his Lordship 's requisition contained in that letter , to take this public method of notifying to such of the inhabitants within my jurisdiction , if any such there be , who have formed resolutions to themselves of leaving this country , and of going in quest of settlements in
America	LOCATION	, that they ought riot to put themselves to the unnecessary trouble and expence of preparing for a removal of their habitations , which they will not , so far as it lies in my power to prevent , be permitted to effectuate .

KINGSTON	LOCATION	UPON HULL . ''

		To the King 's most Excellent Majesty .

		Most Gracious Sovereign , We , your Majesty 's most dutiful and loyal subjects , the guild or brotherhood of masters and pilots seamen of the Trinity-House of
Kingston	LOCATION	upon
Hull	PERSON	, consider the many privileges granted to our ancient corporation by your royal predecessors , and the great advantages derived to us , as a maritime body , and to the town of
Hull	PERSON	by your majesty 's kind attention to encourage and secure the navigation and commerce of these kingdoms , as very great and substantial blessings .

		To minds thus greatfully inspired , and uninfluenced by party , nothing cari create deeper concern than to behold attempts made to disturb publick tranquility , and to overthrow the peaceable enjoyment of every thing that is dear or valuable .

		We therefore think it highly incumbent on us , at a period so truly alarming as the present , when we see the people in most of your Majesty 's provinces in
North America	LOCATION	, cherished and assisted by ill-designing persons , so infatuated as to deny the legislative authority , and so daringly wicked as to act in open rebellion , to give your Majesty this testimony of our unfeigned attachment to your Majesty 's person and government , by earnestly assuring your Majesty , that we hold in the utmost abhorrence , men capable of such proceedings ; and that we think it our duty , as far as we are able , to assist your Majesty in bringing those unhapy and deluded people to a sense of their allegiance , and in carrying into execution the legislative authority of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Given under our common seal the 23d Day of September , in the year of our Lord , 1775 .

Admiralty Office	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- 25th Septemr 1775 .

		It being of very great importance that every possible Effort should be made to secure a passage to
Quebec	LOCATION	for such part of the Troops as you have been directed by my Letter of the 21st Instant to proceed with to that
Place	ORGANIZATION	; I have it in command from my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to suggest to you such Information as they have received respecting the practicability of effecting this Service .

		As the Season is far advanced it is to be suspected that the Transports will on the Entrance of the
River St Lawrence	LOCATION	meet with strong North West Winds , But you must not be discouraged by this circumstance , as the Ships may notwithstanding work up to the Island of
Bic	ORGANIZATION	, or possibly to
Hare Island	LOCATION	, at both which places there is good and safe anchorage , and in the neighbourhood of which the Troops may be landed , and march by Land through a settled Country to
Quebec	LOCATION	, if the Transports can not get higher up ; in which case you must send an Express to General
Carlton	PERSON	immediately upon your arrival at either of those
Islands	LOCATION	, requesting that he would send a proper Officer down to conduct the Troops , and also such Sloops , Schooners & small Craft as can be procured to carry up the Baggage and Stores .

		The Knowledge of these Circumstances is so very material , and the information came from such respectable
Authority	ORGANIZATION	, that it has been judged proper to send a Messenger on purpose with this Dispatch and a Dispatch of the like import from the Earl of
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	to the Commander in Chief of the Troops under orders for Embarkation , in hopes that he willbe able to get to
Corke	PERSON	before your Departure .

		I have only to add that their Lordships , having the firmest reliance on your zeal for His Majesty 's Service , make no doubt of your exerting yourself to the utmost in the execution of this most important part of it and have consequently the greatest confidence in your success .

		Haldimand Papers , BM .

		INTELLIGENCE FROM
LONDON	LOCATION	-LSB-
London	LOCATION	-RSB- September 25 .

		It is the fixed resolution of the
Cabinet	ORGANIZATION	to carry on the war against
America	LOCATION	with the utmost vigour ; and to begin the next campaign as early as possible in the spring .

		The outlines of the plan to be pursued , are , an army of eighteen thousand men to be employed in
New-England	LOCATION	, and another army of twelve thousand men are to act in
Virginia	LOCATION	and the middle Provinces .

		Two fleets are to co-operate with these armies ; one commanded by Admiral
Shuldham	PERSON	-LRB- vice Graves -RRB- and the other by Admiral
Byron	PERSON	.

		It is not necessary to make many observations on this resolution , and this plan .

		The American towns will , of course , be destroyed ; carnage , plunder , rapine , and murder , will be the constant spectacle every where ; and when the coast , and the country , are laid waste by fire and sword , what is to become of our trade ?

		And what is the honour , or the profit of this mighty conquest , if it can be achieved ?

		Can the landed interest alone support the enormous expence of this ruinous war ?

		And of what benefit are the Colonies , when they are desolated ?

		But suppose , what is not quite improbable , that the armies are defeated , and the fleets are burned , will not the Colonies hereafter abhor us , for this attempt to destroy them ?

		Either way the trade to
America	LOCATION	is lost .

		And Great-Britain , if not literally ruined by the separation and expence , will however be so essentially injured and impoverished , she can not support herself as she has hitherto done .

		She will indeed exist , but it will be in a languishing state .

		Yet the Ministers , indifferent to every thing but their salaries , are incessantly flattering and cajoling the country gentlemen with a parcel of crude , idle , visionary tales and expectations , of an American revenue , in order to obtain their votes in
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	; for they well know , that their date in office depends upon their carrying on this American war .

		The African trade has felt the blow already .

		The
West India	LOCATION	trade staggers , and is doomed to fall the next .

		No trade can long stand the present unwise contest .

		The loss of the American commerce is a lasting evil ; the substitute for it , in the flush which the Russian peace and the Spanish armament have caused , is contingent , casual , inadequate .

		LORD
ROCHFORD	PERSON	TO
HORACE	PERSON	ST. PAUL No 21 /
St Jamess	PERSON	29th Septr 1775 .

		Sir Your letter No 44 has been received and laid before the King .

		We are very much disposed to give Credit to the repeated Declarations of the French Ministers that their Government does not give
Sanction	PERSON	to the Proceedings of Individuals in the Trade they carry on with the Rebels in
America	LOCATION	, but notwithstanding the Language Monsr de
Vergennes	LOCATION	held to You in his Conversation on that Subject , it is not possible but he must know , if he ever makes the Inquiries he promises , that very considerable Quantities of Arms and Ammunition have been sent from
France	LOCATION	and the
West India Islands	LOCATION	to several of Our Colonies in
America	LOCATION	.

		These Practices will not be discontinued , unless the Intendants and other Officers in the French Ports and at their
Islands	LOCATION	, who have the Cognizance and Inspection of such Affairs , be not absolutely prohibited from conniving at those Embarkations , and do not receive Orders to prevent them .

		We know for certain the Particulars of several Cargoes loaded at
Bayonne	LOCATION	,
St Malo	PERSON	, and particularly at
Bordeaux	LOCATION	, from whence a Ship was to sail about the beginning of this Month with 300 Casks of Gunpowder & 5000 Musquets with Bayonets compleat , for account of Americans , and there is now at
Paris	LOCATION	a
Philadelphia Merchant	LOCATION	furnished with Money for purchasing
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	.

		As I am now on this Subject I can not avoid mentioning another particular , which is , the Encouragement given to carrying Tobacco & other American Products directly to
France	LOCATION	.

		Many Ships are arrived at
Dunkirk	LOCATION	,
Bayonne	LOCATION	,
Bordeaux	LOCATION	& c with those Commodities directly from
America	LOCATION	.

		This is publickly known to be an illicit Trade at all times , and at this Juncture in particular is of great Prejudice to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, by the Advantage deriving thereby to the rebellious Colonies , & by the facility it gives to their Ships of investing the Produce of their Cargoes in Arms & Ammunition , purchased in
France	LOCATION	, for their return Voyages to
America	LOCATION	.

		These Circumstances are not only mentioned for Your own Information , but You are permitted to report them , as occasions offer , to
Monsr de Vergennes	PERSON	, that he may at least know that we are apprized of what passes , and if their Declarations have any meaning , it belongs to Them to apply the Remedy , without our making any formal Complaint , which is not the Intention to do at present .

		Count
de Guines	PERSON	has not yet made any Application to me about the Conduct of any of Our Sea Officers , with Regard to French Ships .

		When he does , the most diligent Inquiry will be made thereupon , and I shall be enabled in due Time to give a proper Answer .

		AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHARLES BIDDLE -LSB-
Lorient	LOCATION	, October 3 , 1775 -RSB- 2 ... Off the Banks of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	we fell in with several sail , amongst them was a frigate that , about eight o'clock , gave chase to us ; she was then near three leagues from us .

		There was a pleasant breeze , and she gained very little upon us until about ten o'clock , in a heavy squall we found she had gained considerably upon us , they having carried their topgallant sails when we were obliged to take in ours , and lower our topsails .

		Just after the squall a young man named
John Williams	PERSON	fell from the foreyard overboard .

		He was a Bermudian , and swam like a fish .

		A rope was hove to him , which missing , he went astern .

		He was called to , not to be afraid , and answered he was not the least uneasy .

		We threw him a spar .

		-LSB- Captain
John -RSB- Craig	PERSON	was of opinion the frigate would pick him up , and was against heaving to , but I had the brig hove to , the boat hoisted out , and we got him on board .

		we had no right to expect the frigate would heave to when we would not .

		It was a very trying time for me , for the frigate was coming up fast , and I did not know what would be the consequences of my being taken going on such an expedition .

		It may be supposed I was very impatient until we made sail .

		While the boat was out ,
Craig	PERSON	was comforting me by declaring he was sure our heaving to would occasion our being taken .

		However , there was no danger of
Williams	PERSON	's being drowned , for he could swim to
Bermuda	LOCATION	.

		Before we could make sail the frigate was within less than two miles of us .

		It blew hard in squalls all t_he afternoon ; in the squalls she gained upon us , but when we could carry our topgallant sails we dropped her .

		Finding she could not come up with us , just before it was dark she hove to and hoisted a signal of distress .

		As I supposed it only done to decoy us , we paid no regard to her signal ; indeed it was pretty evident nothing material could be the matter , for she carried a press of sail the whole day , and left her convoy , or the ships in company with her , in the morning .

		Before I sailed we had an account of one of our ships being taken by bearing down upon an armed vessel that hoisted a signal of distress .

		Taking vessels by this infamous method should be forbidden by all nations , for , if made a practice , no one would run the hazard of being taken , let the appearance of distress be ever so evident , and thus many lives may be lost that if this shameful practice was put a stop to would be saved .

		I was much rejoiced to get clear of the frigate .

		Some time after in the night we fell in with a brig bound from
Lisbon	LOCATION	to
Cork	PERSON	.

		The captain inquired eagerly what news ?

		I told him the American army had the advantage of the British in several engagements , and expected soon to drive them from the country .

		He struck his speaking trumpet with great violence upon the roughtree and swore he was glad to hear it , and hoped we would soon drive the British from
America	LOCATION	.

		When we were near the coast we passed a great many vessels that from the badness of the weather would not run in with the land .

		The twenty-second day after we left the Capes we arrived at L'Orient .

		I have this Moment seen a Captain of a Vessel from
North Carolina	LOCATION	in twenty one Days to
Cork	PERSON	; he came in yesterday , & reports that he saw
Fort Johns	PERSON	-LSB- t -RSB- on burned by the Rebels ; That when they began to rise there was an Officer and twenty Men of The King 's Troops in the
Fort	LOCATION	, who with the Governor went on board the Man of War for Safety ; That the Day before he sailed , a Messenger had arrived from the back-Settlers to acquaint the People on the Coast that They -LRB- the back-Inhabitants -RRB- would not submit to any Stoppage of their Trade , and that if their Ships were not suffered to proceed with the Produce of the Country , they would come down & bum all the Houses on the Coast , and put the People to the Sword : That they could not live except they had a free-Trade & would not obey any Orders to the contrary .

		He further reports that the back-Settlers had stopped all Kinds of Provisions from coming down the Country for the Supply of the People on the Coast , which had prevented Them from assembling in a Body to exercise & train themselves as they had orders to do : I enquired if those backSettlers had any Disposition to the
King 's Service	ORGANIZATION	, he said not , but that they wished not to be under the Restrictions of their Trade , and were a People impatient of Rule as the others .

MOLYNEUX	PERSON	SHULDHAM TO PHILIP STEPHENS Sir
Chatham Spithead	ORGANIZATION	6 October 1775 .

		The
Chatham	LOCATION	was unmoor 'd yesterday with a Moderate Wind at WNWt and I expected you would have been informed of her being at Sea , but about three OClock it came round to the SWt in which Quarter it continues now blowing fresh and Captain
Raynor	PERSON	was under a necessity of giving Orders to moor again .

		This detention gives me an Opportunity of representing to you the Careless and unfinished manner in which I found my Appartment , as well as those of the Captain and Officers of the
Chatham	LOCATION	, indeed mine so very unfit for an Officer of my Rank that I am sure there is not a Man on board her who is not furnished with a more Warm and comfortable Lodging ; whether this is owing to the negligence of the Workmen , or those who overlook them , or to the false and ill judg 'd Oeconomy , which prevails in our Dock Yards , is not my business to enquire , but I am confident , Sir , it is a matter of such importance that requires the interposition of their
Lordships Authority	ORGANIZATION	to enquire into and correct in all His Majesty 's Ships , but particularly in those destined on the laborious Service , and in the severe Climate where I am appointed to Command , lest their Lordships should suppose I have exaggerated in this representation I beg leave to refer them for confirmation of the truth of it , to Commissioner -LSB-
James -RSB- Gambier	PERSON	and Sir
Peter Parker	PERSON	who did me the honor to dine with me yesterday on board the
Chatham	LOCATION	.

		As the Season is now so far advanced that it is likely I shall meet very severe Weather on the
Coast of America	ORGANIZATION	, I apprehend the Weight & Inconvenience of the Flat bottom Boat now on board may be of very bad consequence , therefore should be glad to be disincumber 'd of her , and that she may be sent at a more favourable opportunity .

		The crew all went from the vessel , and there was no one left on board but an old French seaman I brought from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and myself .

		As it was cold , I ordered him down in the cabin and to shut the scuttle .

		A short time after , perceiving a fire in the caboose which was in the hold , I told
Peter	PERSON	to get up and put it out , but the hasp of he scuttle had got over the staple , and he could not get out , and there was no cabin window by which we could escape .

		In vain we tried every method to break or cut our way out .

		Fortunately the fire burnt down without doing any damage .

		It blew hard , and we remained in this perilous situation for twentyfour hours before the boat came on board and released us .

		As the wind was ahead , I went on shore .

		Octr 1775 .

		Having received three Letters from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	dated the 10th 19th & 29th of July last , giving an Account of the Rebellious proceedings of His Majesty 's Subjects there , I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admty to send you herewith Copies thereof for your Information .

		COUNT DE GUINES TO COUNT DE VERGENNES -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 13 October 1775 No. 297 Sir This week went by again and we have had no meeting with the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have attempted , however , to enlighten myself positively on what had happened in
America	LOCATION	, since the papers have been filled for the past week with such circumstantial details concerning an action in
Boston	LOCATION	that it was difficult finally to think that they were unfounded as they appeared to be .

		It is however the exact truth , the Council has no information concerning this news and they do not believe it to be worthy of credence .

		I discussed this matter in great detail with the person to whom I went , who is attached to the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	and whose knowledge and friendship will be , I hope , most useful to me in these circumstances .

		Without doubt , the majority of the members of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	reckon more than ever on a discord among the provinces of
Northern America	LOCATION	.

		The southern provinces are quite annoyed by the war and especially by the cessation of all trade .

		Paper money is a source of everyday grumble in public opinion ; one must resort to force to bring it into circulation .

		This important point may become the rock that will thwart all the efforts of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and cause its dissolution : there is even a letter from
New York	LOCATION	which asserts that this province refuses to pay forty thousand pound sterling levied by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	has been flattering itself in this manner for more than a year , and convinced that the Americans would fear war , it placed itself in a position where it had to start the war without really having the means to wage it with success ; but the time has come now when the matter must be settled .

		The
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	will come out unscathed in this Parliamentary session , but it should fear the next one .

		Either conciliation or force must end this American affair in 1776 , or else great events will take place in this country which can be abused for awhile , but where an understanding attitude can then be replaced by one all the more terrible for those who owe
Great Britain	LOCATION	an account for their behavior .

		All private opinions always confirm a negotiation with
Russia	LOCATION	; you hold ,
Monsieur le Comte	PERSON	, the same view .

		We differ only on the outcome ; I have forwarded the information to you such as it had been given to me ; it was my duty to do so in circumstances of this importance ; I saw all the dangers , but they would not have warranted my silence .

		Furthermore , the principle of the thing is essential here , since an alliance with
Russia	LOCATION	would bring terror to
America	LOCATION	, raise the stock of the Ministry here , and give
England	LOCATION	the opportunity , the means and per haps the desire to become less peaceful than it had been heretofore necessary as circumstances had isolated her .


Myld North	PERSON	summoned to his home one of the presidents of the board of the
India Company	ORGANIZATION	and asked him how many recruits the Company intended to send there this year .

		The president answered two to three thousand .

		The Minister told him that he had asked him to stop at his home for this reason , that he had no orders to give to the Company , but that he wished , in the name of the King and in his own na , me , to point out to him that the levy of recruits for the
East Indies	LOCATION	would prevent one for the service of the King , in view of the fact that His British Majesty had great need of his troops in order to carry with vigor the next campaign against the Americans .

		Another project of more considerable importance is about to be carried out : it concerns an establishment on the
Mosquito Coast	ORGANIZATION	2 on the continent of
Southern America	LOCATION	.

		The plan of the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	is to acquire land from the chief of the inhabitants of this region and to sell or lease it to those who will agree to settle there ; thirty or forty thousand settlers are expected to be attracted there .

		This project may be surprising at first , but its execution will seem more practicable once you consider the collateral aspects .

		The land could not be more fertile ; it produces sugar comparable in quality to that produced in the islands of the west indies , as well as indigo , cotton , etc. .

		It is rich in food plants of all kinds ; European food plants adjust excellently ; the animals brought there multiply amazingly ; the wood found there , known as
Campeche	LOCATION	wood , also called Mahogany in
England	LOCATION	, is a source of valuable trade .

		The King 's son of that country and two other Indian chiefs have been in
London	LOCATION	for some time and have lodgings at the home of the person who conceived the plan for this establishment .

		He is a man with great talent , much genius ; extensive knowledge and who seems to have a turn for conceiving great undertakings and carrying them out .

		... it would open a new and most interesting branch of trade and that , especially at the present time , it would make the separation of
England	LOCATION	from her colonies less detrimental .

		He insisted most strongly on the political point in view of the location of this establishment ; it can in time becom , e the key to the Spanish possessions occupying a central position among them .

		One can imagine the consequences for this power having the English in such force on that part of the continent ; at present , the latter only have a few outposts there for the protection of the governor of
Jamaica	LOCATION	, which have already inflicted much loss to the Spanish trade .

		I enclose a petition from the city of
Bristol	LOCATION	presented the day before yesterday at the levee of the King of
England	LOCATION	by Mr.
Burke	PERSON	, one of the best supporters of the opposition .

		It is opposite all the preceding petitions ; it rejects means of force ; it asserts that only a good conciliation offers a true solution .

		The
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	agrees on this point ; but where are these possible means of conciliation ?

		LORD SUFFOLK TO
FRANCIS LEGGE	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Whitehall	PERSON	16th Octr 1775 .

		ー Sir , Mr
Burrow	PERSON	arrived at
Lord Dartmouths Office	ORGANIZATION	on the 13th Inst and your dispatches were immediately laid before The King .

		ー As soon as it was seen that the
New England	LOCATION	provinces meditated open Rebellion and Revolt , the Security of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	became an Object of The King 's care and solicitude ; directions have been repeatedly given to the Commander in Chief to attend to it , and the inclosed Extracts of Lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	's Dispatches will shew you that it has been urged in terms that marked out the Ideas that were entertained of it 's Importance ー You will readily believe that His Majesty 's apprehensions for the Safety of
Halifax	LOCATION	were not a little increased by the Intelligence We received of the people of
Machias	LOCATION	having with Impunity destroyed one of The King 's Ships and made prize of another , and having without Interruption fitted out Armed Vessels to cruize in.the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	.

		ー It was therefore thought adviseable that one of the five Regiments destined to sail from
Ireland	LOCATION	for
No America	LOCATION	in the Month of September should proceed directly to
Halifax	LOCATION	, and the Transports with that Regt on board accordingly left
Corke	PERSON	on the 27th Ulto Two other Regiments part of that Embarkation are under Order to proceed to
Quebec	LOCATION	, but if that can not be Effected , which is likely be the Case , they will put into
Halifax	LOCATION	before they proceed to join the
Army	ORGANIZATION	under General
Howe	PERSON	, and the
Roebuck	ORGANIZATION	a 40 Gun Ship which has been Sail 'd more than three weeks for
Halifax	LOCATION	will be a considerable Augmentation of your Naval force .

		ー The Advices however contained in your Dispatches and the
Intelligence Mr Burrow	ORGANIZATION	brings that the Rebels from
Machias	LOCATION	had made Descents both at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	and
Annapolis	LOCATION	, are very alarming Circumstances and there is but too much reason to fear that some Attempts may have been made upon
Halifax	LOCATION	before you could receive any Succour either from home or from General
Gage	PERSON	, unless the sending the Tartar into the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, which was a very proper and well timed measure , should have discouraged those Invaders from proceeding any further least their Retreat should be cut off .

		ー The ruinous State of the Fortifications at
Halifax	LOCATION	has been the Subject of frequent Consideration , but as the ablest Engineers who have been consulted upon it have concurred in opinion that the Harbour is too extensive and the Advantages of Attack too many to admit of any regular effectual Plan , all Ideas of that Kind have been laid aside .

		ー It is judged proper however upon the present Occasion to direct that some Works upon a temporary plan of defence should be constructed for the
Security of the King	ORGANIZATION	's Naval Yard and the
Board of Ordnance	ORGANIZATION	will by this Conveyance send out Orders to that Effect to the principal Engineer at
Halifax	LOCATION	or if there be none there , an Engineer will take his passage in the Packet .

		COUNT DE GUINES TO COUNT DE VERGENNES -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 20 October 1775 No. 298 Sir , I brought up again the
Newfoundland	LOCATION	affair yesterday .

		All the Ministers are here and there is no reason to postpone it anymore .

		I intend to speak of this matter every day to
Mylord Rochford	PERSON	, and you will assist me most effectually if you will do the same with
Mylord Stormont	ORGANIZATION	; the great policy of the British Ministers is to gain time .

		The affair seems clear to me , and
Mylord Rochford	PERSON	himself agrees .

		If there is to be no competition , English fishermen have no right to be established between
Bonavista	LOCATION	and St.
John	PERSON	.

		If competition is the rule , it excludes by its own right sedentary establishments that would make it unreal ; in both cases , it is a point in our favor .

		We have another undisputable one atising from the orders which the King of
England	LOCATION	gave in 1764 and 1770 to destroy these establishments following the memoranda delivered by the
French Ambassadors	ORGANIZATION	to this Court .

		These orders which have proved to be without effect after eleven years can no longer be offered as a satisfaction to our grievances .

		Mylord Rocheford , however , repeatedly made such a proposal yesterday , on his own , he said , without authorization , as if it were a new idea that had just entered his mind .

		I answered that this was all we wished ; if the effective date could be determined at the earliest time so that our next fishing operation could become a reality , which the King 2 would have no other way .

		We must give the impression to require this in order to make the exchange necessary , in as much as it is the only means of conciliation , and so that we turn the affair more surely to our advantage .

		As for the competition ,
Mylord Rochford	PERSON	told me several times yesterday that it was absurd ; that this mixture of English and French fishermen would be an eternal source of difficulties ; and as he seemed to fear such difficulties , I innocently suggested to him that we send warships to police our fishermen as
England	LOCATION	does it with her own .

		As I expected , this idea made him shudder , and I do not despair that we can use it again , perhaps effectively , to make him finally sick of competition .

		I had to prolong my conference with this Minister because of the subject of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	; I left it to the Prince of Masseran -LSB- Maserand -RSB- to talk to him of the American affairs , and to probe his ulterior plans , as we have continually and carefully been doing .

		The Minister gave yesterday morning the order to send four more Infantry Regiments to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The militia will receive orders , and the plan to have at least 40 thousand men available in
America	LOCATION	next summer appears certain .

		The Prince of
Masseran	LOCATION	made a few remarks upon the difficulty and the necessity to resort to foreign troops , in an effort to prevent it ; he immediately mentioned the Russians .


Mylord Rochford	PERSON	replied that they would take them wherever they could get them , and referred only to the men from
Brunswick	LOCATION	and
Hesse	LOCATION	.

		Here is something , Sir , of which I was warned yesterday by someone who has been of useful service to us for several years and whose information always proved to be correct .

		Day before yesterday , Lord
North	PERSON	sent for Mr.
Franks	PERSON	, a wealthy Jew and an esteemed merchant .

		He struck a bargain with him to supply rations between now and July next to the troops in
America	LOCATION	as follows : 19 thousand Englishmen 12 thousand Canadians 15 thousand Russians Total : 46 thousand men .

		This contract is very expensive and will cost fifty per cent more than if they could procure these supplies in
America	LOCATION	, since it is necessary to send them from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Franks	PERSON	himself confided this fact in the person from whom I have it and asked that it be kept secret because Mylord North had expressly requested it : This Minister even added that he especially did not want revealed the num ber of Russians who were going to be in the pay of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Franks	PERSON	is particularly esteemed by Their Britannic Majesties .

		I would answer , Sir , for the loyalty of the person who gave methese details as I would for myself .

		I do not doubt that he received them from Mr.
Franks	PERSON	.

		However , why speak of the Russians if it is to be a mystery ; and why would M ylord
North	LOCATION	have struck such a large bargain to such an important purpose a week before the return of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	which has not given him its consent ?

		As to the first objection , it is indeed possible that this Minister found it safer to present the accomplished fact and have all the preparations for the war in
America	LOCATION	decided upon , rather than having them exposed to the delays and even the uncertainties of the decisions of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ratification will be just as easy to obtain and it will not involve detrimental delays .

		The
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	expects long debates on the opening day .

		They hope that Lord
Chatham	LOCATION	will not be able to be there .

		That day will be especially interesting as the topic of the address by the King of
England	LOCATION	will be restricted to the American affairs , and the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	will present immediately afterwards the facts , the available means , and its own views .

		PRECIS PREPARED FOR THE KING OF THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE EXPEDITION AGAINST THE SOUTHERN COLONIES -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB-
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	, October 22 , 1775 -RSB- Mr
Martin Govr	PERSON	of
North Carolina	LOCATION	, in his Dispatches to the Earl of
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	dated in July 1775 , & which were received on the 10th of Septr makes a full representation of the State of that Province , and it appearing that notwithstanding he had been reduced to the humiHating necessity of taking refuge on board His Majesty 's Sloop Cruizer in
Cape Fear River	LOCATION	, & of submitting to the disgrace of seeing the King 's Fort burnt by the rebels , yet he continued to be of opinion , that if he was supported with a small Force , and a supply of Arms & some Field Pieces , he could raise a Body of Men in that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	sufficient to reduce the rebellious Subjects both there , and in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, to obedience , & to awe the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
Virginia	LOCATION	, & prevent any Auxiliaries being sent from thence to the Northward .

		He further says that .

		Addresses , in support of Govt had been sent to him from the back Settlements , & that these Addresses had been signed by 14 or 1500 Men .

		In consequence of these Dispatches the Earl of
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	on the 2d Septr 2 signified The King 's Commands to the Master General of the Ordnance , that he should send to the Commander in Chief in
No America	LOCATION	, 10,000 stand of Arms & 6 light Field Pieces , together with 200 rounds of Powder & Ball for each Musket & field Piece in order to enable him to afford such aid & assistance to the Governor of
No Carolina	LOCATION	, as the situation and circumstances of that Province , might from time to time , require ; And the Mastr General of the Ordnance was at the same time informed , that one of His Majesty 's Ships of War would be ordered to take under her convoy such Storeship as the Board of Ordnance should provide for the conveyance of the Arms & Artillery abovementioned .

		On the 15th Septr Lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	acquainted Major
Genl Howe	PERSON	by letter , with the substance of the Advices which had been received from
Govr Martin	PERSON	& with the orders which had been given respecting the Arms and Artillery which were to be sent to him ; and at the same time signified to him , His Majesty 's Pleasure , that if he should find , when the letter reached him , that there was good ground to suppose that the sending to
No Carolina	LOCATION	a
Detachment of his Army	ORGANIZATION	under an able & intelligent Officer , would have the good effect Mr
Martin	PERSON	seemed to expect from it , & His Majesty 's Service would , in other respects , admit of it , he should in that case , send such Detachment accordingly , consisting of , at least , one Battalion , together with the Arms & Field Pieces above mentioned .

		On the 23d Septr a letter was recd at
Ld Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	's Office from
Lord Wm Campbell the Govr of South Carolina	ORGANIZATION	, containing a very full representation of the State of that Province , from which it appeared that a very considerable part of the People suffering under the tyranny & oppression of the traiterous Acts of the
Congresses & Committees	ORGANIZATION	, had shewn a disposition to resist them , & to support legal Governt & therefore as this was a circumstance deserving attention , in any plan which the Commander in chief might have in view , in consequence of Lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	's letter of the 15th Sepr for employing a part of his force during the open part of the Winter in an Expedition to the Southward , it was judged proper to transmit this intelligence to him in a Dispatch dated 25th of Septr .

		These Advices recd from the
Govrs of No Carolina & So Carolina	ORGANIZATION	were in great measure confirmed by other intelligence received thro ' variety of channels .

		Persons of property & interest in the
Southern Colonies	ORGANIZATION	complained that the friends of Govt there , were neglected ; & Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, in a Dispatch recd much about the same time , made himself responsible for securing the obedience of
Virginia	LOCATION	, with the assistance of a small Force .

		Upon a view of all these Circumstances , it was resolved early in
Octr	LOCATION	to take up the consideration of an Expedition to the Southern Colonies upon a more extensive plan ; & His Majesty 's Pleasure was signified that 5 Regiments of Infantry , Vizt the 15th 37th 53d 54th & 57th and also 2
Companies of Artillery	ORGANIZATION	, taking with them 10 Battalion Guns , & as many Howitzers & Ammusettes as the number of Artillery Men could serve , should hold themselves in readiness to embark on or before the 1st of December .

		On the 22d of Octr Lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	acquainted Major General
Howe	PERSON	with the grounds & reasons upon which this plan was adopted , & with the orders that had been given , for the several
Corps	ORGANIZATION	to hold themselves in readiness .

		His Lordship further acquainted the General , that the whole would be ordered to proceed under convoy of a proper Naval Force to
Cape Fear River	LOCATION	, where there was good reason to expect , from the representations made by
Govr Martin	PERSON	, they would be joined by a large Body of Highland Emigrants .

		The General was also told that it was The
King	ORGANIZATION	's Intention that this Body of Troops should , upon their arrival , be under the Command of one of the General Officers then with him , & that one of them should proceed immediately upon the arrival of that Dispatch in a ship of War to
Cape Fear River	LOCATION	, & to remain on board either within the River , or in the Offing , as should be judged most proper , until the arrival of the Forces from
Corke	LOCATION	, before which time it was observed , he would probably have been able to collect such information & materials as might enable him the better to judge of the plan of operations to be pursued ー And as there was reason to believe that the Navigation of that part of the Coast of
North America	LOCATION	was both dangerous & difficult , the having 2 or 3 small Vessels furnished with able Pilots to cruize off the Coast for the arrival of the Fleet was mentioned to him as a circumstance deserving his attention .

		It was further observed in that Dispatch that the representations made by
Govr Martin	PERSON	, of the great probability there was , that any body of Troops sent to
No Carolina	LOCATION	would , upon their arrival , be joined , by a considerable number of Highland Emigrants , & by the well-affected Inhabitants of 4 or 5 Counties , were the reasons which had principally induced The King 's Servants to advise the Armaments proceeding in the first place to
Cape Fear River	LOCATION	in
North Carolina	LOCATION	, but that at the same time it was not His Majesty 's Intentions that the Genl should in his plan of operations , be confined to any particular Province , & that his choice , in that respect , must be governed by his own judgment , after maturely weighing every circumstance of greater or less advantage & facility , in the means of restoring the public tranquillity & reestablishing the authority of The
King	ORGANIZATION	's Govt which object being once effected in any one of the Southern Colonies , the Troops might proceed to another , leaving the support & protection of that which had been so reduced to a
Corps	ORGANIZATION	formed out of the well-affected Provincials who should have taken up Arms in The King 's Cause .

		With regard to the steps which it might be proper for the General to take in case he should possess himself either of the Capital of any of the Southern Provinces , or of any other Town in which the Civil Govr might exercise the functions of his
Office	ORGANIZATION	with safety , it was suggested that it would be proper ; in that case to require that all Committees of Towns or Congresses of such Committees , as well as other unlawful associations which had been formed , should be dissolved .

		That the
Courts of Justice	ORGANIZATION	should be opened .

		That all persons whatsoever should take the oaths of allegiance before the Judges of such Courts , & that those who had , by the instigation of the Committees , taken up Arms against lawful
Authority	ORGANIZATION	, should surrender the same , & make such declaration of their future obedience as the Govr should , by the advice of the Council , direct & require .

		But that if the Inhabitants of the Province , or any part of them , should refuse to comply with these requisitions , it would be the duty of The
King	ORGANIZATION	's General , to employ the Troops under his Command , to force them to obedience , by seizing the persons & effects of the Delinquents , & by proceeding against any Towns in which the People should assemble in Arms , hold meetings of Committees or Congresses or prevent The
King 's Courts of Justice	ORGANIZATION	from assembling .

		It was further observed that the sending so considerable a body of Troops , was a Measure adopted principally upon the encouragement held out by the King 's Governors , that if such a respectable force was sent as might make it safe for the friends of Govt to shew themselves , they would soon prevail over those , who having found means to get the sword into their hands , had been able to effect their rebellious purposes without control , & therefore at the same time that the Rebels were to be encouraged to hope for mercy upon submission , it would be proper that every species of reward should be offered to .

		those who should consent to list under the Royal Banner , & who , besides an allowance of the same pay as the King 's Troops rec 'd so long as they continued in service , should be encouraged to expect a remission of all arrears of Quit rent due to the Crown .

		& an exemption from the payment of any , for a few years to come .

		There are a variety of other circumstances pointed out in Lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	's letter to
Genl Howe	PERSON	not necessary to recite in this Narrative , 1 .

		Dear Sir ー I take the chance of catching you at
Plymouth	LOCATION	to apprise you that five regiments from
Ireland	LOCATION	are ordered to embark without delay ; and as the transports are already engaged , will probably sail the beginning of December .

		Their destination is to
North Carolina	LOCATION	, in order to take possession of that province and to make a powerful diversion by that means to the attacks of the rebels in the north .

		As Sir
Peter Parker	PERSON	will be ready for the sea in about a month , he will have the conduct of this expedition ; and as we understand that the 28-gun ships are rather too large to get up the river , we shall muster all the small 20-gun ships that can be got ready in time and appropriate them to this service ; but we have no sloops to spare , so that if you think after your arrival at
Boston	LOCATION	that you can spare any small craft that will be of use in this business , you would do well to send them to await the arrival of Sir
Peter Parker	PERSON	with the transports .

		And if you can with privacy procure any pilots for that coast , it might be of material service ; but you must be upon your guard about keeping this matter an impenetrable secret , unless you should find it necessary to communicate it to General
Howe	PERSON	or the commander-in-chief of the army in
America	LOCATION	.

		COUNT DE GUINES TO COUNT DE VERGENNES -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 24 October 1775 No. 300 I had the honor , Sir , to write you a private letter concerning the news that arrived from
Canada	LOCATION	and I took advantage of the immediate departure of a reliable person .

		I received more information in the course of the evening , according to which I consider
Canada	LOCATION	as lost for this country , because it is already an accomplished fact , or , which is the same , because it can not be prevented .

		These Americans are a hundred times better soldiers and politicians than the English , and it is not surprising that they finally tired of considering the latter as such ; the conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	will decide the freedom of
America	LOCATION	.

		Once the Rebels are in control of
Quebec	LOCATION	,
Montreal	LOCATION	and the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	river , and join forces with the Canadians , their rearwill be protected and
America	LOCATION	will be independent : The preliminary step of this great operation was the capture of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	; but before breaking out they waited until communications between
England	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	would stop for six months and give them all the time needed to complete this great work .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, neither divided nor corrupted , is more capable of great undertaakings than the English parliament .

		The capture of
Halifax	LOCATION	is not as certain as the conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	, however , according to the information I have , I feel it deserves credence to some degree .

		I have just received notice that the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	has sent an order to all ports to the effect that no ship whatever be allowed to sail .

		I shall be certain that this fact is correct only when I receive confirmation from the ports themselves .

		At all events , the courier who carriers this dispatch will surely go through because I am giving him the order , should he meet with any obstacle , to charter a packet-boat for himself , and that could not be refused to him .

		PRO , Admiralty 1/484 .

		THE KING 'S , SPEECH OPENING THE SESSION OF PARLIAMENT -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB- October 26 , 1775 -RSB- My Lords , and Gentlemen ; The present situation of
America	LOCATION	, and my constant desire to have your advice , concurrence , and assistance on every important occasion , have determined me to call you thus early together .

		Those who have long too successfully laboured to inflame my people in
America	LOCATION	, by gross misrepresentations , and to infuse into their minds a system of opinions repugnant to the true constitution of the colonies , and to their subordinate relation to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, now openly avow their revolt , hostility , and rebellion .

		They have raised troops , and are collecting a naval force ; they have seized the public revenue , and assume to themselves legislative , executive , and judicial powers , which they already exercise in the most arbitrary manner over the persons and properties of their fellow subjects .

		And although many of these unhappy people may still retain their loyalty , and may be too wise not to see the fatal consequence of this usurpation , and wish to resist it , yet the torrent of violence has been strong enough to compel their acquiescence till a sufficient force shall appear to support them .

		The authors and promoters of this desperate conspiracy have , in the conduct of it , derived great advantage from the difference of our intention and theirs .

		They meant only to amuse , by vague expressions of attachment to the parent state , and the strongest protestations of loyalty to me , whilst they were preparing for a general revolt .

		On our part , though it was declared in your last session that a rebellion existed within the province of the Massachuset 's
Bay	LOCATION	, yet even that province we wished rather to reclaim than to subdue .

		The resolutions of parliament breathed a spirit of moderation and forbearance ; conciliatory propositions accompanied the measures taken to enforce authority , and the coercive acts were adapted to cases of criminal combinations amongst subjects not then in arms .

		have acted with the same temper , anxious to prevent , if it had been possible , the effusion of the blood of my subjects , and the calamities which are inseparable from a state of war ; still hoping that my people in
America	LOCATION	wouid have discerned the traitorous views of their leaders , and have been convinced , that to be a subject of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, with aff its consequences , is to be the freest member of any civil society in the known world .

		The rebellious war now levied is become more general , and is manifestly carried on for the purpose of establishing an independent empire .

		I need not dwell upon the fatal effects of the success of such a plan .

		The object is too important , the spirit of the British nation too high , the resources with which God hath blessed her too numerous , to give up so many colonies which she has planted with great industry , nursed with great tenderness , encouraged with many commercial advantages , and protected and defended at much expence of blood and treasure .

		It is now become the part of wisdom and -LRB- in its effects -RRB- of clemency , to put a speedy end to these disorders by the most decisive exertions .

		For this purpose I have increased my naval establishment , and greatly augmented my land forces ; but in such a manner as may be the least burthensome to my kingdoms .

		I have also the satisfaction to inform you , that I have received the most friendly offers of foreign assistance ; and if I shall make any treaties in consequence thereof , they shall be laid before you .

		And I have , in testimony of my affection for my people , who can have no cause in which I am not equally interested , sent to the garrisons of
Gilbraltar	LOCATION	and
Port Mahon	PERSON	, a part of my electoral troops , in order that a larger number of the established forces of this kingdom may be applied to the maintenance of its authority ; and the national militia , planned and regulated with equal regard to the rights , safety , and protection of my crown and people , may give a farther extent and .

		activity to our military operations .

		When the unhappy and deluded multitude , against whom this force will be directed , shall become sensible of their error , I shall be ready to receive the misled with tenderness and mercy : and in order to prevent the inconveniences which may arise from the great distance of their situation , and to remove , as soon as possible , the calamities which they suffer , I shall give authority to certain persons upon the spot to grant general or particular pardons and indemnities , in such manner , and to such persons as they shall think fit ; and to receive the submission of any province or colony , which shall be disposed to return to its allegiance .

		It may be also proper to authorize the persons so commissioned to restore such province or colony so returning to its allegiance , to the free exercise of its trade and com merce , and to the same protection and security , as if such province or colony had never revolted .

		The
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	had been prorogued to July 27 , 1775 on May 17 , 1775 and was subsequently further prorogued to October 26 , 1775 .

		AN ACCOUNT OF LORD SANDWICH 'S REMARKS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB- October 26 , 1775 -RSB- In answer to some strictures made by the noble duke 2 who spoke last , he defended the conduct of the naval officer who commanded on the American station , and seemed to hint some degree of censure upon the operations on shore .

		He confessed , that things were much altered , and that it was necessary to considerably augment our navy ; that he had already taken every precaution in his power ; that the armament of last year had consisted of thirty armed vessels of different sizes , two of them two decked vessels ; that twenty were actually sailed , or were ready to sail to reinforce them ; and that it was the intention of administration to complete the number , by the time that operations were to commence , to seventy vessels , which would be such aforce cooperating with the army , as would render it impossible for the Americans either to resist , keep together , or subsist ; as they would have at once all the calamities of a war to contend with , without the means of carrying it on ; being thus cut off from all supplies they might expect to derive from
Europe	LOCATION	, or eslewhere .

		His lordship confessed , that administration had been deceived in some measure ; yet he thought it necessary now to declare , that it was his own private opinion , that the stronger the navy was , the more effectual their operations would be .

		He saw the matter very evidently in that light ; but it was generally believed , if a larger force had been demanded , it would have raised an opposition to the measures at large ; and this was one very powerful motive for his not explaining his own ideas so fully as otherwise he was most certainly disposed to do .

		REMARKS OF DR.
JOHN HINCHCLIFFE	PERSON	IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB- October 26 , 1775 -RSB- We were assured last year , that upon the appearance of a re-inforcement which could protect them from the insults of the mob , a considerable party would declare themselves in favour of the mother country : that there is no reason now to flatter ourselves with such an expectation is too obvious to be insisted upon .

		It was said too , in the spring , that the Americans would not , some indeed were confidently persuaded they could not , fight ; yet we now certainly know that they can and will fight , for they have fought .

		It is true , they were defeated , but considering the stand they made , and the intrepidity of the troops they had to contend with , they were not disgraced by their defeat .

		We were made to believe , a year ago , that the restraints put upon the commerce and fisheries of the colonies would press so hard upon their interests , as to bring them to submission .

		We have now learnt that their commerce is but a secondary consideration : if it may not be called liberty itself , that they are contending for , it is at least the opinion of liberty , which operates no less forcibly on the passions of mankind .

Hinchcliffe	PERSON	was Bishop of
Peterborough	LOCATION	.

		REMARKS OF
GEORGE JOHNSTONE	PERSON	IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB- October 26 , 1775 -RSB- ... What my worthy friend -LRB- Mr.
Burke	PERSON	-RRB- said last year of their industry , may now be applied to their warlike achievements .

		Consider the power of such materials in the hands of a minister who knew how to encourage their industry , and apply their courage to the purposes of national defence : but all the secret of our colony government is now reduced to mere force , the baneful engine of destructive depotism ; nevertheless it is with pleasure I perceive the force of this country , when wielded in such a cause , is totally inadequate ; your own army is not sufficient ; your illegal application for foreign mercenaries at the beginning of the contest , sufficiently shews your weakness ; your navy is equally incapable of effecting the purposes which are expected from it .

		It may ruin their foreign trade ; it may destroy some of their towns -LRB- though that is doubtful -RRB- but the lying in their rivers , as some suppose , without a superior military force to protect them on shore ; I say as a sea officer , if the war is thoroughly kindled , the thing is impossible .

		We are apt to judge from what happened at
Quebec	LOCATION	; where the French , never remarkable for naval enterprize , though naturally brave , quitted their fire raft , and left it to the chance of the stream , or to be towed off by boats ; but this I maintain , that any fleet lying in a river where ー they can not command the shore , that such fleet is liable to be burnt if the people are willing in that enterprize to run the same risk of life and danger to which the crew of the ships are exposed , I mean by sticking by the fire vessel , whatever she may be , till with wind and stream they lay the enemy athwart hause ; and who can doubt that the people in
America	LOCATION	are capable of such exertions of courage when we see them refuse quarter , when we find them devoting themselves to death with such enthusiasm ?

		Another circumstance respecting ships is not generally known .

		The wonders they have hitherto performed has been owing to the ignorance of engineers in placing their batteries ; but I am afraid the secret is now out as to their power against .

		the shore , without a military force to assist them ; a single gun in a retired situation , or on an eminence , or a single howitzer , will dislodge a first rate man of war , and may burn her , to add to the disgrace .

		I speak this publicly , that you may not expect more from the sea service than it is capable to perform .

		Ruin their trade you certainly may , but at an expence as ruinous to this country .

		Has any of the ministry considered the immense expence of such naval armaments on the coast of
America	LOCATION	, in transports and ships of war ?

		Have we calculated the chance of destruction by those horrid streams of wind peculiar to that coast , that sometimes sweep all before them ?

		Where are the resources on which this country can depend in case our empire in
America	LOCATION	is lost ?

		I do not say you will feel the disadvantage immediately , I know the various channels to which commerce and industry may divert their streams ; I am also certain that the wants of
America	LOCATION	must be supplied in some way or other with certain goods from
Great Britain	LOCATION	; I further know , that a nation can only trade to the extent of its capital , and in case one vent is cut off , it will probably find another , while its manufactures are cheaper and better than those of other nations .

		I believe such to be the case with many branches of our manufacture at present , but is it possible it can long continue ?

		Must not the same laws of nature follow this commercial country that has affected
Venice	LOCATION	and
Genoa	ORGANIZATION	, the Hans Towns , and other commercial states ?

		The acquirement of wealth must produce dearness in living ; dearness of living must produce dearness of labour ; dearness of labour must produce dearness of manufactures ; dearness of manufactures must conduct trade to some place where cheapness of living will give the preference in the markets .

		Thus the circle of commerce has hitherto run : but the settlement of
North America	LOCATION	under the old establishment , seemed to defy the powers of those fleeting principles .


America	LOCATION	was bound to take your manufactures only to whatever price they might rise ; you were bound to take most of her raw materials and to give her commerce protection ; a complete system in the exchange of all commodities was established within your own dominion , which might last beyond the views of human calculation , if properly conducted .

		This is the great purpose to which I look up to
America	LOCATION	as a naval and as a commercial power ; how often have I indulged myself in these thoughts , unable to see the end of our glory from the same causes which have destroyed other states , little dreaming that one infatuated minister could tempt , seduce , and persuade a whole nation to cut the strings of such harmony .

		The .

		hon. gentleman who opened the debate , has remarked how we recovered from the interruptions of our commerce during the last war .

		The hon. gentleman forgets that we had the free and interrupted resources of
America	LOCATION	during the last war ; that in seizing the ships of our enemies we added to the national wealth and increased our own commerce ; the progress was double , here it runs in an inverse proportion , no man knows the final effects as yet ; like the bursting of a burning mountain , it is sport and play to the distant spectators who think themselves safe , but the eruption may spread to cover this city in ruin .

London Gazette	LOCATION	, October 24 to October 28 , 1775 .

		The same issue of the
London Gazette	ORGANIZATION	oontained a second Order in Council extending the same privileges for exportation to
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	TO
JOSIAH MARTIN Sir Whitehall	PERSON	27th October 1775 .

		The advantages that may attend the sending immediately a Force to the assistance of the Friends of Legal Government in the
Four Southern Provinces of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	,
North & South Carolina	LOCATION	, and
Georgia	LOCATION	, are so apparent , and have been so fully stated by yourself & the Governors of the other 3 Provinces , that the King has thought fit to order , that a Body of His Majesty 's Forces , consisting of Seven Regiments , should prepare to embark at
Corke	ORGANIZATION	about the 1st of December , in order to proceed with 2
Companies of Artillery	ORGANIZATION	, & a proper number of Battalion Guns , Howitzers , etc to
Cape Fear River	LOCATION	.

		You will see by the inclosed copy of a Letter to Major General
Howe	PERSON	, that this separate
Corps	ORGANIZATION	is to be commanded by one of the General Officers with him , and it will also fully instruct you as to the whole plan & conduct of the Expedition ; and I have only to add , that any corps of Provincials that may be formed upon this occasion , must be raised by your
Authority	ORGANIZATION	, & commanded by you as Provincial Colonel , with the same pay as a Colonel upon the British Establishment , but without any rank in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	or claim to half pay , which for reasons I have already given can not be allowed .

		You will observe that in the Letter to Major General
Howe	PERSON	, the propriety of sending pilots with the Ship that carries the General Officer to
Cape Fear River	LOCATION	is particularly pointed out ; but as it may be uncertain whether Pilots well acquainted with the coast of
North Carolina	LOCATION	, can be procured at
Boston	LOCATION	or
New York	LOCATION	, it will be very necessary that you should , with as much secresy as possible , engage a proper number to be put on board the Vessels that will be ordered -LRB- in conformity to the instructions already given -RRB- to cruize upon the coast until the Fleet & Transports shall arrive .

		I am also Commanded by The King to suggest to you the great advantage & utility that will attend the procuring , if practicable , a number of Carriages & draft Horses , for the use of the Troops , in any operations they may findit necessary to carry on , and from what you have said of the disposition of some of the back Counties , I should hope it may not be impracticable , if managed with Secrecy & caution The
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	met yesterday & inclosed I send you His Majesty 's Speech to both Houses , together with their addresses in return thereto , which I trust will have the effect to convince the rebellious Inhabitants of the Colonies , of the firm Resolution of every branch of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	, to maintain the dignity and authority of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	; desirous at the same time to receive with all proper Indulgence , the submission of any
Colony	ORGANIZATION	that shall he inclined to return to its Duty and Allegiance .

		I am & c

London	LOCATION	, 27 October 1775 No. 301 I have forwarded , Sir , to the Prince of Masseran the same information which I had the honor to send you .

		We share the same views and we hide nothing from each other .

		I feel rather fortunate that my inclinations in this matter are in harmony with the execution of the King 's orders .

		This Ambassador has recognized the consequences to which an establishment on the
Mosquito Coast	ORGANIZATION	will lead .

		2 But since he can not speak openly to the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	about it without revealing the source of our information , and still awaiting the orders from his Court , he merely sounded the Ministers in this matter and observed in a general way that any such undertaking would be of a nature to disrupt the good harmony which now exists between both nations .

		MARINE AGENT AT
LORIENT	LOCATION	TO GABRIEL DE SARTINE -LRB- Copy -RRB-
Lorient	LOCATION	, 27 October 1775 .

		Following your request which
Thad	PERSON	the honor to receive with your dispatch dated on the sixth of this month , and following the remarks addressed to you by the Count of
Vergennes	LOCATION	, with which you were so kind to acquaint me , I gathered the most exact information with regard to the unlading of foreign ships presently in this port .

		I found that the schooner Charming Polly of 70 freight tons , from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, under the command of Mr.
Thomas Paton	PERSON	, and belonging to
Thomas Masson	PERSON	who is on board and who had come here last year in command of a small ship laden with tea from
New England	LOCATION	, had come to this port in behalf of the congress in order to buy gunpowder , rifles and saltpetre .

		Having found neither rifles nor gunpowder , she was to sail with the first strong winds laden with one hundred and some barrels of saltpetre .

		I prohibited the expedition of the latter pretending that I did not know whether the government would not retain it for its own use .

		I warned Mr.
Bérard	PERSON	with whom
Masson	PERSON	had been dealing that he was not to allow this merchandise to go abroad without finding out first whether the department of ordnance -LSB- regie des poudres -RSB- had any use for it .

		There is also here a brigantine of one hundred freight tons , named Dune , under the command of Captain
Craig	PERSON	, also from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and which was sent here with the same intentions .

		I know that the Captain went to
Nantes	ORGANIZATION	by land in an attempt to buy war ammunition which he could not find .

		Since he grounded his ship on the sandbank of K.nevelle -LSB- ? -RSB-

		in order to clean her , he said , I shall watch over the nature of the goods she will take on .

		In any case , I shall take all necessary measures to prevent ships coming from the English Colonies and returning there from taking on war ammunition .

		I learned that the transaction which was attempted here did take place in
Bordeaux	LOCATION	and that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has empowered Mr.
Masson	PERSON	to offer flour , tar , pitch , tobacco and generally all kinds of goods from the English Colonies to Mr.
Bérard	PERSON	in exchange for gunpowder , rifles and saltpetre ; they are not interested in guns , cannon-balls or bullets .

		Furthermore , I see no difficulty in preventing the export of saltpetre , except to
Holland	LOCATION	with proper permits .

		We need not make public the reasons for this precaution ; it is very easy , and as it happened .

		here , in spite of the deal and speculations made by Mr.
Bérard	PERSON	, all the saltpetre remained in his possession .

		COUNT DE VERGENNES TO COUNT DE GUINES -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Fontainebleau	LOCATION	, 28 October 1775 No. 158 Everything we hear in various places seems to confirm our doubts concerning the rumored expedition of Russian troops to
America	LOCATION	.

		But since in matters concerned with facts , conjectures can only be vicious , it will be most wise to wait until the events actually take place before we know what to believe and before we come to a decision .

		If the contract which the government is said to have signed with a wealthy Jew to provide supplies to 46 thousand men in
America	LOCATION	is as real as the source from which you have your information leads you to believe it , the expedition of 15 thousand Russians , as unlikely as it may appear , would be more likely than the levy of 12 thousand Canadians mentioned in the report .

		2 If the English Ministry can count on this expedient for next year , why have they not used it this year ?

		The solution to this problem would do less credit to their foresight than to their discernment .

		Sir , if
Russia	LOCATION	does not lower in any way her price of four million pounds sterling in exchange for a Russian expeditionary force , I do not believe that the British Government will put such a price on the help which the Great
Catherine	PERSON	would extend to them .

		Such a request , if we accept it as true , is as good as a refusal .

		AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHARLES BIDDLE -LSB-
Lorient	LOCATION	, October 30 , 1775 -RSB- It was a disagreeable and dangerous business I was on , for I was not acquainted with any person in
France	LOCATION	, and after an article that was prohibited from being sent out of the country .

		I had some letters with me from my old friend
Pasquer	PERSON	, 2 but they were written long before I had any thoughts of going to
France	LOCATION	.

		As I knew Mr.
Pasquer	PERSON	had an uncle in
Nantes	LOCATION	, I brought these letters , and with them introduced myself to Mr.
Richard	PERSON	.

		I believe that was his name .

		He was a very respectable man , and received me with great politeness ; and his son , who was an officer in the army , behaved very friendly .

		They both told me it was a very dangerous business I was upon , and appeared uneasy at my visiting them .

		I applied to some of the masters of ships I had known in
Port au Prince	LOCATION	, but they were afraid of me when they knew my business .

		One of them told me it was highly probable I would be taken up by the officers of the government if I remained much longer .

		Finding nothing to be done here , I set off for L'Orient by land .

		The roads are good , but the country not so thickly settled as I expected to find it .

		The horses were not good .

		I was determined on my arrival at L'Orient to sail for
Holland	LOCATION	, where I was ordered if powder and arms could not be had in
France	LOCATION	.

		However , it was left in a great measure to myself to do what I thought best .

		Upon my return to L'Orient , Captain -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Mason	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, was there in a schooner loaded with saltpetre bound home .

		He informed me the merchant who did his business proposed sending a ship for
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, with a great quantity of powder , arms , and other war-like stores .

		He told me if I would go in his schooner he would load the brig and bring her and the ship to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		It was with great reluctance I consented to leave the brig , but as I could do it consistent with my instructions , and considered it would probably be of great advantage to my country , as Messrs.
Barard Freres	PERSON	promised faithfully to send the ship if
Mason	PERSON	stayed , fully relying on their promises and those of
Mason	PERSON	, I went on board the schooner .

		We sailed from L'Orient the 30th of October .

		ALEXANDER SCHAW TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	My Lord Since I had the honour of attending your Lordship , I have employ 'd my thoughts with much anxiety , on the plan of operations intended for
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		I wishd to reduce them into writing .

		I will lay down a few facts as the foundation of what I wish to propose , that it may at once appear whether my oppinions arising from these facts are well or ill founded .

		In the province of
North Carolina	LOCATION	there are several rivers , which run a considerable way into the Country .

		Upon the south is
Cape	LOCATION	fear river which is navigable for ships of large burden , as far as a shoal which they call the fflatts , about seven miles above
Brunswick	LOCATION	town , which is situated 12 miles within the bar .

		In consequence of this impediment vessels , which have a drat of above 9 1/2 feet water , can not go up to
Wilmington	LOCATION	, which is the next port above and the most considerable town on the river even at spring tides , till they are lightned to that draught .

		Above or rather at
Wilmington	LOCATION	, the
Northeast	LOCATION	and .


Northwest	ORGANIZATION	branches of the river join .

		The Northeast is the least considerable , and upon its whole extent there is no town , tho ' its banks are very well settled .

		The
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	branch is much larger and runs much farther into the Country .

		The first town is Cross creek about 100 miles above
Wilmington	LOCATION	.

		Here the whole trade with the back settlers is carried on , for a great way round .

		From ffort
Johnston	PERSON	at the mouth of the river to
Brunswick	LOCATION	is 12 miles .

		From
Brunswick	LOCATION	to
Wilmington	LOCATION	there are two roads : one goes up the right Side of the river upon which
Brunswick	ORGANIZATION	stands and crosses two fferries opposite to
Wilmington	LOCATION	, occasioned by the river being there divided , by a large swampy
Island	LOCATION	thro ' which there is a very bad road of a mile and a half .

		The length of this road is reckoned 16 .

		Miles .

		To go by the other road , one must Cross a fferry at
Brunswick	ORGANIZATION	of a mile over , from whence to
Wilmington	LOCATION	it is about ten miles .

		Every part of these roads , is more or less sandy .

		Some of them , for miles together is very deep , as the surface is often a pure white sand , without a particle of soil to bind it together .

		This is the Case with allmost every part of the province near the sea .

		The roads on both sides the river cross a few Water runs , which in the Country are called creeks : they are generally swampy along the sides , which are crowded with trees , bushes , vines & brambles .

		Over all these Creeks are wooden bridges .

		Whenever the land is dry , there is little or no brush .

		The Woods in general are in the stile of open Groves in
England	LOCATION	, except in such places as have once been cleared and afterwards abandoned .

		These are allways covered with brush .

		The roads upon the
North	LOCATION	west branch of the river , grow more solid every mile above
Wilmington	LOCATION	, and long before they reach Cross creek are very hard .

		The only making they bestow upon the roads in the flat part of the Country is cutting out the trees to the necessary breadth , in as even a line as they can , and where the ground is wet , they make a small ditch on either side .

		The Roads thro ' swamp land , are made by first laying logs in the direction of the road and covering them cross ways with small pine trees , layd regularly together over sod , with which the logs are previously covered .

		The roads run constantly thro the woods , which tho ' they are generally pretty open , yet objects at any considerable distance , are intercepted from the eye , by the trees crouding into the line of direction as the distance increases .

		I thought it necessary to be so minute as this road along the west side of the
North west	LOCATION	branch , is that by which the junction of the provincials with the troops must be effected .

		The next navigable river to the Northward is the
Neuse	LOCATION	, upon which
Newbern	PERSON	the Governours residence is situated , about fourty
Miles	PERSON	from the sound .

		This river can admit only of small vesssels .

		Albemarle sound is the inlet to
Roanoke	LOCATION	river , upon which
Edenton	LOCATION	is situated 60 miles within land .

		And about 140 , miles further up the
River	LOCATION	is
Halifax	LOCATION	which carries on a considerable trade : In the neighbourhood of
Halifax	LOCATION	; they have a good breed of horses , to the Southward the horses are smaller , but spirited and hardy .

		The lower parts of the province are subject to
Agues	LOCATION	, pleurisies & bilious Complaints : the people of the back country are strangers to those disorders .

		The Rivers in the lower parts of the Country have no fords .

		Their banks are in general coverd with impenetrable swamps & bottomless morasses , a very few spots excepted , upon which generaly plantations are settled .

		But in the back country , they have good fords .

		The settlements upon the lower part of
Capefear	LOCATION	river do not produce grain enough , particularly wheat , to answer their own demands .

		Large quantities are therefore sent down from Cross creek in row boats , which in return carry up whatever goods are wanted for the use of the back settlers .

		Every proprietor of ever so small a piece of land , raises some Indian Corn & sweet potatoes , & breeds some hoggs & a calf or two ; and a man must be very poor who walks a foot .


Brunswick	LOCATION	country where the troops must first land , contains fewer of the lower class of country people , than any part of the whole province , particularly near the sea .

		There is no specie in the province , and there never was a person who could command a sum of any consequence even of their paper currency .

		Nothing in the stile of a Banker or money Merchant was ever heard of .


Governour Tryon	PERSON	left the province very soon after the submission of the Regulators , and when Colonel
-LSB- Josiah -RSB- Martin	PERSON	succeeded to the Government , their wounds were still bleeding , and the -LSB- y -RSB- had received no protection , from the oppression of the petty fogging attorneys , whose rapacity had been the original cause of their rebellion .


Governour Martin	PERSON	arrived in the province at this very critical time .

		He made a progress thro ' his Government ; and when we was in this part of the Country , his attention to the releif of these poor people was such as won him their highest confidence & esteem .

		There is now a numerous body of the Sons & grandsons of the first scotch highland settlers besides the later emigrants who retain that enthusiastick love for the country from which they are descended , which indeed scarce a highlander ever loses , that they will support its dignity at every risk .

		The Governour has attached them strongly to him , as well as the later emigrants by many services he has had opportunities of doing them Many highland gentlemen are now in that country , several of whom have been officers , and still retain their influence among the people .

		Many of the people of the largest property in the Country , tho ' they now languish under the hand of oppression , will instantly join , to support the Constitution , upon the first appearance of a chance of support .

		The low country people in general have fire arms .

		I never was in a house without seeing one or more muskets .

		Indeed the Militia laws require them to have them .

		The highland emigrants carried few arms with them , and the regulators delivered up the greatest part of theirs to
Governour Tryon	PERSON	.

		The six iron guns that were at the Governours house dismounted & spiked up , are now in the hands of the rebels with several ship guns , they took from a Mr
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	, at
Newbern	PERSON	.

		They have got two more guns at
Wilmington	LOCATION	& probably , if the Cruizer sloop has left her station , they have carried off , some of the Guns at ffort
Johnston	PERSON	.

		There is reason however to beleive they have neither powder nor shot for these guns .

		These things being premised , I shall now , with the utmost diffidence lay before your Lordship , a few Ideas that have occurrd to me in the Course of my thinking upon this subject It appears from the account I have given of the soil near the sea , and of the swampy branches or Creeks , which cross the roads , and the small size of the horses , that it would be a matter of great difficulty , to transport heavy cannon & waggons , either into the interior part of the country or along the Coast .

		At the same time it is absolutely necessary to have a good train of Artilery as it was owing to his cannon in a great measure , perhaps solely , that Governor
Tryon	PERSON	defeated the regulators : for the fire of his musketry made no impression upon them .

		And perhaps it would be an improvement , to use balls upon the occasion smaller than common , as at the short distance they must be used at , the effect of the smaller shot would be in proportion to their numbers .

		Trenching & pioneers tools will be necessary in a large proportion , as there may be often occasion to repair the Causeways , as they call them , across the swampy runs , and perhaps to make bridges over the larger ones , if the enemy should destroy them , or if they should be found not to be strong enough which is a very possible case , as they are constructed for light carriages only .

		It can not be supposed that the people to be raised have any camp necessaries , such as kettles , lanterns & c. these should be provided for them , and indeed the more care is taken of them they will do their duty the better .

		It would be proper to send out , some alert Soldiers qualified , to be
Sergeants & Corporals	ORGANIZATION	for the express purpose of training the provincial regiments , which would soon make them far superior to the rebells , who have very few helps of that kind .

		I have allready observed that the town of
Brunswick	LOCATION	which indeed is but a stragling village , is 12 .

		miles , within the barr .

		At low water there is ten feet water upon the barr , at spring tides there is from 19 to 20 feet so that in fine weather ships of deep draught can easily go in .

		The water , both below & above the flatts is deep enough for any vessel , Vessels can run from the Barr to
Brunswick	LOCATION	in three , or four hours with the tide , with allmost any wind .

		There is good anchorage within half musket shot of the town .

		The bank is pretty high for this Country , and the woods are cut down a good way round the town , tho ' there are shrubby bushes .

		An encampment there , can not be Commanded , as there is no higher ground , and the approaches to the Camp can easily be defended on the land side , and if there should be any sick , the houses would serve as good hospitals .

		There is plenty of water .

		This is the only town on the right or west side of the river , so that should a body of the rebells attempt to harrass the troops as they have no tents nor camp implements of any kind , they must soon disperse without a blow .

		But there would be little risk of any immediate attempt of this kind if some of the lightest vessels , properly armed & having defences musket proof , with a few troops on board were instantly sent up to
Wilmington	LOCATION	.

		The town would submit , as most of the Inhabitants are well affected , and by having one ship at the town and another a little higher at Mr Harnets plantation , all communication , from the
North	LOCATION	east to the
North-west	LOCATION	river , especially across the
Northwest	LOCATION	, would be renderd next to impossible for many miles up And wherever it was attempted , it could only be done by a few men , as there is no way even for a single horse thro ' the swamps on the river sides .

		There could then be little difficulty in effecting the junction with the highlanders & provincials from Cross creek and the adjoining Counties .


Brunswick	ORGANIZATION	county as I have said is thinly settled , consequently , cattle and horses are few , especially near the sea ; but these and every thing else the province affords , will be plentifully supplied from the back country , when the people march to make a junction , which if the previous steps go successfully on , may be effectuated in ten or twelve days , after disembarking the troops If a superiority was once obtaind in this part of the Country , which one would think nothing but some very unforseen accident would prevent , it is next to certain , that every other part might be soon reduced .

		The Ringleaders must fly : and the people would infallibly submit upon promise of pardon & protection .

		And here let me mention , that a great many copies of a proper proclamation from the King should be printed , in order to be dispersed wherever a man could be found to read them , which would open the eyes of the poor country people , who have been most amazingly deluded .

		Now supposing things to have succeeded at
Cape	LOCATION	fear , it may be proper to detach a part of the regulars , with a body of the provincial troops by sea and to land them in
Albemarle	LOCATION	sound , where the inhabitants of
Currituck	LOCATION	and
Pasquotonk	LOCATION	, with many of , the people , round them are well affected , as well as their neighbours mthat part of
Virginia	LOCATION	which is next them .

		And if a previous plan can be settled with the loyal gentlemen in that part of the Country , they could prepare their people for taking Arms to join the forces upon their landing so that the rebells in the middle counties would then be betwixt two fires if they ventur 'd to stand out .

		There is little to be apprehended from
South Carolina	LOCATION	, they are too weak to think of sending troops out of their province ; and should they be mad enough , a report that their negroes were to be declared free , would secure them effectualy at home .

		The only chance the rebells would have of support is from
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Yet as that province is so much cut by
Rivers	ORGANIZATION	, a few hundred men in armed vessels , by making descents in different places would keep the whole province in alarm and harrass them extremly independant of what Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	hopes to be able to accomplish .

		I have allready mentioned the scarcity of money in this province .

		The provincial troops must be payd : and many other services require ready money .

		But the point of all others upon which the raising a force in this Country most depends is
Governour Martin	PERSON	, being at the head of every thing .

		I mentioned the necessity of it to your Lordship , and I beg leave to repeat it .

		Your Idea my Lord of local rank , will I hope do .

		Yet from rank in
America	LOCATION	only , I am afraid he never will be considered by the gentlemen of the Country as having that importance at home which real rank in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, would appear to them to give him .

		I have perhaps my Lord in this long paper , given my oppinion with a great deal more freedom than I had a right to do , but as the sole object of my coming to
England	LOCATION	, was to lay before your Lordship , whatever hints , my small knowledge or Abilities furnished me with , I have done it without reserve , tho ' not without that diffidence , which every man must feel , when writing upon subjects of such high importance .

ROCHFORD	PERSON	1 .

		No 19
Fontainebleau	ORGANIZATION	31 October 1775 Separate My Lord My first Conversation with Mr
de Vergennes	PERSON	was a pretty long one , and as friendly as possible ー After the first Compliments were over , He said `` You find us here , My Lord , exactly in the same Sentiments in which you left us ー desirous of living in perfect Harmony with you , and very far from meaning to do anything that can tend to encrease the Embarras of your present critical Situation '' ー I answered that We relied entirely upon the repeated assurance They had given us of their Friendship , which would always meet with a suitable Return on our Part , as I was authorized to declare in The King 's Name , in the Audience which I was ordered to demand for that Purpose ー I added that after all They had said upon the Subject , and with the Justice We did to the Sincerity of the present french
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	, and to their fair and frank manner of treating We could not but be persuaded that They never would give the American Rebels any sort of Countenance , ー Assistance or Supply , but I observed to Him , that it was very possible that attempts of that kind might be made , and escape all their Vigilance ; and that whenever we had any Suspicion of that Nature , We should communicate it to them , that they might take the Proper Steps to prevent Attempts contrary to those friendly Sentiments and Intentions , which they had so often declared , and on which We loved to rely ー He answered that no Power on
Earth	LOCATION	, ever did or could prevent all Illicit Trade , which the Prospect of great Gain , would lead Men to attempt at every Hazard , and then quoted the famous answer of that Dutch Merchant , who said that if a Lucrative Trade could be carried on with Hell , he would send his Ships thither au Risque de bruler leur Voiles .

		ー `` But , continued He ー whatever We can prevent We certainly will .

		The Intelligence you had of Ammunition being sent by the Governor of
St. Domingo	LOCATION	proves upon Inquiry to be void of all Truth ー We found upon Examination , that far from being able to supply others , He had not a sufficient Provision for Himself ー That Defficiency well supplied , but I again assure you that no Ammunition Stores or Assistance of any kind shall be sent to
North America	LOCATION	either by the Governor of
St Domingo	LOCATION	, or any other Governor or Person whatever , that is under our Controle , and that We will sincerely and bona fide prevent every thing that could be to your Detriment , as far as it is possible for any Government to prevent it '' ー After I had said a few Words to thank Him for these Promises He of his own Accord , went on with the general Subject , which He entered into pretty largely ー He began with saying `` Loin de vouloir augmenter
Vos Embarras	ORGANIZATION	, Nous les voions avec quelque Peine '' -LRB- that was his very expression -RRB- and then after a short Pause added ー `` Ce qui vous arrive en Amerique n'est de la Convenance Personne '' I answered that I was sure the Consequences could not escape a Man of his Reflexion and Penetration , and so used to extend his Views ー To this He replied that He might venture to say , that they did not escape Him ー `` indeed added He , they are very obvious , as obvious as the Consequences of the entire Cession of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		I was at
Constantinople	LOCATION	when the last Peace was made .

		When I heard the Conditions , I told several of my Friends there , that I was persuaded
England	LOCATION	would not be long before She had Reason to repent of having removed the only check that could keep Her Colonies in Awe .

		My Prediction has been but too well verified ー I think I equally see the Consequences , that must follow the Independance of
North America	LOCATION	, if your Colonies ever should carry that Point , which they now so visibly aim at .

		In that Case they would immediately set about forming a great Marine , and as they have every possible advantage for Ship-building would not be long before they had such Fleets , as would be an over-match for the whole
Naval Power of Europe	LOCATION	, could it be united against them .

		With this Superiority and every advantage of Situation they might when they pleased , conquer both Your Islands and Ours .

		I am persuaded that they would not stop here , but would in Process of
Time	ORGANIZATION	advance to the
Southern Continent of America	ORGANIZATION	, and either subdue the Inhabitants , or carry them along with them , and in the end , not leave a foot of that Hemisphere in the Possession of any European Power .

		All these Consequences would not , indeed be immediate .

		Neither you nor I should live to see them , but for being remote they are not less sure .

		Short sighted narrow Policy may indeed , rejoice in every Destress of a Rival , without looking beyond the present Hour , but He who looks forward , and thinks of and weighs Consequences , must consider what now happens to you in
America	LOCATION	, as a General Evil , of which every Nation that has Settlements there , has its Share , and in that Light , I assure you , it has always appeared to Mc '' ー All this My Lord
Mr de Vergennes	PERSON	said entirely of his own Accord , and with the Air and Manner of a Man , who speaks his Real Opinion .

		Your Lordship will easily believe , that I expressed great Satisfaction at finding Him in such Sentiments , fell in and applauded his Reasoning , which I did with the better Grace , as He sees the Object in the same Light in which it has always struck Mc , I am as much convinced as He possibly can be , that not only our own future Fate , but much of the
General Fate of Europe	ORGANIZATION	is involved , in our present unhappy Contest , and that this and every other Nation that has Settlements in
America	LOCATION	ought to wish Us Success , whether they readdy do so or not , I pretend not to say .

		After my Audience I made a Visit to Mr de
Maurepas	ORGANIZATION	, 2 and told Him that the Language The King his Master , had held to Me could not but be highly agreeable to my Court .

		He answered that He had already seen Mr de
Vergennes	LOCATION	and knew what had passed at my Audience , and then added `` Je suis bien aise que
Le Roi	PERSON	vous ait parle comme je nais qu'il pense .

		Soiez sur
Melord	PERSON	, que Nous ne sommes pas
Gens	PERSON	que cherchent à abuser des Circonstances et a pecher dans l'Eau trouble .

		Our Wish and Intention is to live in Peace and Friendship with you to maintain the public Tranquillity and to arrange the Affairs of our own Interior in the best Manner We can . ''

		I answered that I was persuaded that was ー the Real Plan of the present Ministry and that it was every way worthy of their Wisdom , and then repeated a Part of what I had said to Mr
de Vergennes	PERSON	of our entire Reliance upon the assurances they had given Us , that they never would furnish the American Rebels with Ammunition or Stores of any kind He said ー `` be assured We do not and will not directly or indirectly give them any Sort of Assistance you had a Notion that the Governor of
St Domingo	ORGANIZATION	had sent them Gunpowder , but We find , upon the strictest Examination , that it was a groundless Report '' ー We then , My Lord , spoke a little of the general Temper of the Nation , observed that it was strongly with
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, which He said , was a great Point at all Times , but particularly in such Contests as these , and very properly , I think , attributed this general Disposition to the Americans having now clearly shewn , that they aim at absolute Independance .

		`` Opinions , said He , may , be devided about this or that Measure ; as for Instance , whether it was right or wrong to attempt to tax the Americans , but now that they shew that what they aim at is Une Independence absolue .

		Votre Nation sont bien que cette Independance ne sauvoit Lui convenir '' In this Respect at least , My Lord , I am persuaded both Mr
de Maurepas	PERSON	, and Mr de
Vergennes	LOCATION	see the Thing in its true point of View , and are convinced that the Americans wish to be independent , and will make themselves so , if they can ー Mr
de Maurepas	PERSON	, who always treats me as an old Acquaintance , talked to me with great seeming frankness and cordiality .

		He is perfectly well and has the appearance of a Man who is pleased with his Situation , ー and is firm in the Saddle ー I made my Visit short , as many People of the first fashion were waiting in his outward Room .

		I have now given Your Lordship a particular , and I am afraid , too long an Account of what passed in these first Conversations the only interesting ones I have as yet had with either of the above-mentioned Ministers ー I think I have omitted nothing material ー I am sure I have added nothing of my own .

R.N. Sir Preston Boston Novr	ORGANIZATION	1 1775 The 22d of last Month Mr
Lobb	PERSON	delivered me your two Letters Octr 9 with the Extract of two Letters therein mentioned from Governor
Tryon	PERSON	.

		When I mentioned that I could not at present determine upon the propriety of your Conduct in firing upon those who were stealing the Guns , and had killed one of your People , 2 I did not mean to condemn what you had done , but wished that by some vigorous effort you could have compelled the City to return the Guns they had so scandalously permitted to be taken away , and perhaps with a Design to disgrace the King 's Officers immediately on the Spot .

		Upon reconsidering the matter I am happy nothing more was done ; the Action though extremely impudent and provoking was certainly not of sufficient turpitude to occasion the destruction of the City , especially at that Juncture when you was unprovided with Instructions how to act in such Cases .

		I am extremely pleased your firing upon the Battery did not occasion those restraints we expected ; and I hope to whatever Cause the Quiet of the City may be attributed they will yet have the Wisdom speedily to return to their Duty , and no longer suffer their present delusion to operate to their Ruin .

		I heartily wish you may seize some of the Ringleaders .

		I send back the Viper to you ; Captain -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	carries with him Shirts , Frocks , Trowsers , Shoes , and the Rope you have desired .

		I approve of your detaining and disposal of the Viper .

		The intention of a Sloop with you is to be employed in the most effectual manner for the good of the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	; And it was certainly right not to trust the Mails in the
Charlotte	LOCATION	, 3 when by tarrying a few days they might go with so much greater Safety in the Viper .

Gage	PERSON	was sailed for
England	LOCATION	when your Letter arrived vindicating yourself against the Complaint of
Lieutt Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, which indeed I had done before , but I shewed it to General -LSB-

		LETTER TO THE PRINTER OF
PINKNEY	PERSON	'S
VIRGINIA GAZETTE Hampton	ORGANIZATION	, November 1 , 1775 .

		MR. PRINTER , For the satisfaction of the public , I shall endeavour to give you as true an account of the late matters at this place as I am able .

		Last Wednesday night -LSB- October 25 -RSB- a party of men from the tenders went on shore , and robbed several houses on
Mill Creek	PERSON	, nigh
Hampton	PERSON	.

		We heard of this the next morning , and observed the tenders at anchor , no great distance from the place where several vessels had been sunk in the channel of
Hampton	LOCATION	river , to prevent their surprizing us .

		The channel was not completely stopped , and we imagined , from their situation they intended to prevent our compleating the work , or perhaps might intend to land , to be at their old trade .

		However , to observe their motions particularly , captain -LSB-
George -RSB- Lyne	PERSON	, in the minute service , rode round nigh where the tenders lay , and left orders for his lieutenant -LRB- Mr.
Smith	PERSON	-RRB- with 30 men , to come over to him , by crossing one of the branches of
Hampton river	LOCATION	.

		In a short time after captain
Lyne	PERSON	had fixed himself on the point , lieutenant
Smith	PERSON	was over with the men , and then two vollies of musquetry were discharged from the tenders , and answered by captain
Lyne	PERSON	from his post by a rifle , which was answered by a four pounder from one of the tenders ; then began a pretty warm fire from all the tenders .

		Captain -LSB-
George -RSB- Nicholas	PERSON	, observing this , soon joined about 25 of his men .

		The fire of our musquetry caused the tender nighest to us to sheer off some distance .

		The fire consisted of 4 pounders , grape shot & c. for about one hour .

		Not a man of our 's was hurt .

		Whether our men did any damage is uncetain .

		They could not get nigher than 300 yards .

		Some say they saw men fall in one of the tenders .

		After waiting under cover nigh the shore , and finding they would not land , the men were ordered to retreat to the woods , to try whether that would not induce them to land ; but all in vain as long as we stayed .

		The men were then marched into
Hampton	LOCATION	, and about 5 o'clock in the afternoon some of them landed , and burnt Mr.
Edward Cooper	PERSON	's house .

		In the night they cut a passage through the vessels that were sunk , and the next morning , about 8 o'clock -LRB- which was about half an hour after colonel
Woodford	PERSON	and captain
Bluford	PERSON	arrived with a rifle company -RRB- 5 tenders , to wit , a large schooner , 2 sloops , and 2 pilot boats , passed the passage they had cleared , and drew up a-breast of the town ; they then gave 3 chears , and began a heavy fire .

		Colonel
Woodford	PERSON	immediately posted captain

Lyne	PERSON	with his company was ordered to march to the cross roads just out of town to sustain any attack that might come from
James	PERSON	or Back river .

		The colonel had been informed that men were landed from both these rivers .

		The musquet and rifle balls soon began to fly so thick that few men were seen upon the decks .

		The engagement continued very warm for some time .

		At length they began to cut and slip their cables , and all cleared themselves , except one , which was boarded and taken by some of our men .

		They took in her the gunner and 7 men , 3 of whom were wounded , 2 mortally -LRB- both since dead -RRB- , 1 white woman , and 2 negro men ; lieutenant
Wright	PERSON	, who commanded the prize , after receiving a ball , jumped overboard , and it is thought he was not able to reach the tenders .

		Several more jumped overboard ; but it is not known what is become of them , or what damage is done on board of the other tenders .

		In those 2 different actions , Mr.
Printer	PERSON	, officers and soldiers of the regular , minute , and militia , acted with a spirit becoming freemen and Americans , and must evince that Americans will die , or be free !

		CAPTAIN
SAMUEL LESLIE	PERSON	TO MAJOR GENERAL
WILLIAM HOWE	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Gosport Virginia	LOCATION	1st Novr 1775 .

		Sir : I have the honour to inform you that I landed the 12th of last month at 11 o'Clock at night about three miles from hence with
Lieut Lawrie	PERSON	, two Serjeants , & forty rank and file of the 14th Regiment , and after marching three miles into the country in search of Artillery we found in a wood nineteen pieces of cannon , some of them twelve , others nine , six & three pounders ; seventeen of which we destroyed , & brought off two , and then returning to our boats we reimbarked without the least opposition .

		ー Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	accompanied us upon this expedition : ー On the 17th of October his Lordship was informed , that there was a great quantity of Artillery , small arms and all sorts of ammunition , concealed in different stores at a place called
Kemp	PERSON	's landing , in consequence of which , I , with Capt
Cooper	PERSON	,
Lieuts Batut	PERSON	,
Lawrie	PERSON	, &
Leslie	PERSON	, Ensigns Wools , Boys ,
Ogle	PERSON	, &
Lindsay	PERSON	, three Serjeants & seventy rank & file of the 14th Regiment ,
Lieut Allen	PERSON	, one Serjeant and twenty marines , some young gentlemen of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	& ten or twelve seamen , embarked at 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon in boats & a Schooner in which some Guns were mounted to cover our landing , and proceeded seven or eight miles up the eastern branch of
Elizabeth river	LOCATION	to
Newtown	LOCATION	, where we landed without opposition notwithstanding above two hundred of the rebels were at exercise near that place the same evening , and marching three or four miles through the Country we arrived at
Kemp	PERSON	's landing a little after it was dark , where we searched several stores and could discover nothing but a good many small arms , musquet locks , a little powder & ball , two Drums , & a quantity of Buck shot , all which we either brought off or destroyed ; and returning pretty near the same road we went we reimbarked about 2 ' oClock the next morning without interruption .

		We likewise took several prisoners one of whom was a Captain of Minute , men and another a Delegate of the Convention at
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		2 I have also the pleasure to acquaint your Excellency that Lieut Batut with two Serjeants and Thirty six rank & file landed at
Norfolk	LOCATION	the 19th of October at 12 ` oClock at noon and marching into the Country two miles from thence , took twenty pieces of cannon -LRB- from six to three pounders -RRB- concealed in a wood , thirteen of which he destroyed & brought away seven ; and returned about 4 ` oClock in the Afternoon unmolested .

		Many great guns , small arms , & other implements of war have been taken since by small parties , so that there has been in all at least seventy seven pieces of ordinance taken & destroyed since my Detachment arrived here without the smallest opposition , which is a proof that it would not require a very large force to subdue this Colony .

		There are about eight hundred of the rebels now at
Williamsburg	LOCATION	& four hundred at
Hampton	LOCATION	.

		We are in possession of a large store on the banks of the
Southern	LOCATION	branch of
Elizabeth river	LOCATION	, under cover of the Otter sloop of war , so that we are not very apprehensive of an attack tho ' the Rebels often threaten to pay us a visit .

		As our situation is so extremely critical I flatter myself that you will be so good as to send us a reinforcement as soon as possible , particularly the two Companies of our Regiment at
Boston	LOCATION	or Castle
William	PERSON	.

		The rest of the Regiment we expect from
St Augustine	ORGANIZATION	as soon as it is relieved by three Companies of the 16th from
Pensacola	LOCATION	.

		There are thirty men of my Detachment on board Lord
Dunmores	PERSON	ship & another one that his Lordship has taken up for a transport .

		I have been favoured with your Excellency 's letter of the 12th of September wherein you inform me that my Detachment must be supplied with provisions by the Contractors of
St Augustine	ORGANIZATION	, & that the King must pay the transportation of them from thence , which mode of supply I am well assured will be impracticable at this time , for we never could be sure of being furnished with them regularly as vessels can not be procured for that purpose , & even if they could they would be in constant danger of being taken by the Rebels , and besides , fresh provisions is much cheaper & better for the men than salt , and the expence of the transportation of the latter from
St Augustine	ORGANIZATION	would be by all accounts almost as much as the former will cost here .

		However , Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	says that he will take upon him self to have whatever troops may arrive here properly supplied in the meantime , and his Lordship thinks that there ought to be a particular Contractor appointed for this Colony exclusive of any other .

		Capt
Fordyce	PERSON	, with
Lieuts Napier & Wallace	ORGANIZATION	, three Serjeants , three Corporals , two Drummers , and fifty five private men arrived here from
St Augustine	LOCATION	the 20th of last month , from whence he brought some ammunition , bedding , & provisions ; and was prevented from bringing a greater quantity of the two last articles by Governor
-LSB- Patrick -RSB- Tonyn	PERSON	's giving positive orders to the Agent of the Contractors and the Barrack Master not to issue more on their peril .

		I do myself the honour to enclose your Excellency two Monthly returns by one of which you will see that Capt
Blackett	PERSON	died here the 14th of last month , in consequence of which I flatter myself that Capt
James Urquhart	PERSON	will succeed to the Company ,
Lieut William Brown	PERSON	to the Capt Lieutenancy , and Ensign Thos Appleford Wools to the Lieutenancy , as they are all very worthy men & good officers .

		CAPTAIN
EDWARD THORNBROUGH	PERSON	, R.N. , TO
HENRY LAURENS From	PERSON	on board His Majesty 's Ship Tamer , the 1st of November 1775 .

		Sir , The many unprovoked insults the King 's servants in this province have received , from those Assemblies who have had the hardiness to assume the reins of government , are too numerous , and too well known , to make it necessary for me to mention them .

		I will confine myself entirely to what relates to my own department , and the trust reposed in me .

		I therefore address you , Sir , as a principal actor in the measures now adopted , and desire you will acquaint your associates , and all others whom it may concern , that if his Majesty 's agents in
Charlestown	LOCATION	, are not permitted , regularly and without molestation , to supply the King 's ships Tamer and
Cherokee	LOCATION	, under my command , with such provisions as I think necessary to demand ; I am determined , from this day , not to suffer any vessel to enter into , or depart from
Charlestown	LOCATION	, that it is in my power to prevent .

		The bearer of this , is owner of a vessel , who has unloaded materials at the
King	ORGANIZATION	's fort , which is now held in contempt and defiance of his Majesty 's authority ; and , whatever pretexts this man may use to colour his disloyalty , I never will suffer his vessel to depart , till
Walker	PERSON	, the gunner of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's fort , now a prisoner at the barracks , and who I look upon as under my protection , is sent on board the Tamer .

		Savages ought to blush at the return the King 's servants have received , for their humanity to one of the most infamous and most ungrateful of Villians , in whose service this poor man has suffered .

		I am , Sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO PHILIP
STEPHENS Sir Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	2 Novr 1775 .

		I wrote you fully by the
Pallas Transport	ORGANIZATION	, which sailed from hence the 12th Ulto with General
Gage	PERSON	on board : The next day upon advices received from
Canada	LOCATION	, General
Howe	PERSON	applied to me for a Convoy to some Transports intended to carry two Regiments to
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		As they could not be got ready to sail until the end of October , I consulted the Captains with me and others well acquainted with the River St Lawrence upon the probability of their getting up .

		All the Gentlemen were of opinion it was so late in the Season that Winter would be set in too severely by the time the Ships could get in the
River St Lawrence	LOCATION	, and that hard Gales of Wind and Snow Storms would not only prevent their getting up , but perhaps endanger the loss of the whole Convoy .

		I intended to have sent the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	; but , upon my communicating to General
Howe	PERSON	the danger there was of the Troops neither getting to
Quebec	LOCATION	, nor returning here again , he gave up all thoughts of sending any to
Canada	LOCATION	this fall .

		The 12th the
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	anchored in
Nantasket	LOCATION	and the next day I received a Letter from Capt.
Collins	PERSON	a Copy of which is inclosed .

		Wishing to continue as much force as possible in the
Bay	LOCATION	, I ordered him to cruize another Week , and then come up to
Boston	LOCATION	and get ready to go to the Southward with Lord
Dartmouths	PERSON	Dispatches for the Governors of his Majesty 's
Southern Colonies	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Cerberus being now caulked , victualled and in all respects fit for Sea , I directed the
Scarborough	PERSON	to take her Station in
Charles Town River	LOCATION	, and Captain
Symons	PERSON	to cruize between
Cape Cod	LOCATION	and
Cape Anne	LOCATION	until the Mercury returned from convoying the
Pallas Transport	LOCATION	, then to extend his Cruize to
Casco Bay	LOCATION	, visiting
Piscatagua	LOCATION	and the Isle of Shoals as he found Opportunity .

		One Division of Transports with live Cattle and Forage for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	arrived the 16th from
Annapoli	LOCATION	-LSB- s. -RSB- On the 18th the Nautilus came up from her Cruizes Captain
Collins	PERSON	being in a very ill State of health .

		I granted him Leave to be on shore while the Sloop is getting ready again for Sea .

		The
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	returned this day from
New Providence	LOCATION	with the Transports ; and I had the pleasure to find by Captain
Linzee	PERSON	the Inhabitants are determined to defend themselves against the Rebels and to approve themselves good Subjects to his Majesty .

		Governor
-LSB- Montfort -RSB- Browne	PERSON	was absent , but Captain
Linzee	PERSON	having received a Letter from the President of the Counsil -LRB- a Copy of which is inclosed -RRB- 2 he came away .

		I have stationed the Falcon to the Southward of
Boston	LOCATION	; and the
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	, while she remains here , guards the Mouth of
Winnisimmet River	LOCATION	.

		The Swan arrived from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	with two Transports having on board live Cattle , Poultry , Wood & c for the Fleet .

		On the 22d the
Charlotte Sloop	ORGANIZATION	also returned from
New York	LOCATION	and
Rhode Island	LOCATION	with Letters from Captains
Vandeput	PERSON	and
Wallace	PERSON	; The former having detained an Inhabitant of
New York	LOCATION	upon an accusation of being concerned in burning the
Asia	LOCATION	's Barge ; Many Affidavits transmitted to me proving I think beyond a Doubt the accused Person was not present at the time nor any ways aiding or assisting , And Application being also made by the Recorder and Aldermen of the City for the mans Release assuring Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	he was a peaceable disposed Citizen , I have ordered him to be set at Liberty , but an Ensign in the
Connecticut Militia	LOCATION	, likewise a Prisoner on board the
Asia	LOCATION	, I have directed to be detained and carried to
England	LOCATION	; considering him as an Officer although of low rank , in Arms against his Sovereign .

		I send Copies of Captain Vandeputs Letter and the inclosure therein mentioned for your further Information .

		Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	also writes in a Letter , dated October the 9 , that so far from withholding provisions from the Ship in Consequence of his firing upon the Battery he had lately compleated to four months , and that they were regularly supplied with fresh Beef ; That -LSB-
Isaac -RSB- Sears	PERSON	has sold his house and removed his Effects to
Connecticut	LOCATION	, And that the Delegates and Rebel Officers , fearing to be seized , pass the River at a considerable distance from the Town .

		I inclose an Extract from Captain Vandeputs Letter containing further Intelligence .

		When I sent the Transports to Captain
Wallace	PERSON	, which returned with the Swan , I directed him to fill them with live Cattle , Hay , Wood , Vegetables & c for the Fleet ; to take those things by force from the Rebels , but to pay for them to Friends of Government .

		I have great pleasure in transmitting to you the inclosed account Captain
Wallace	PERSON	has sent me of his Proceedings on this occasion as it does him Honour , and will I hope afford their Lordships very satisfactory Intelligence of our Situation at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		A few Days since I sent two Transports to
Halifax	LOCATION	to be laden with essence of Spruce and
Wood for the Fleet	ORGANIZATION	, and being well assured that after the Middle of November
Halifax	PERSON	had nothing to apprehend from the Rebels until April next ; I sent Orders for the
Somerset	LOCATION	to sail for
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	as soon as Commissioner
Arbuthnot	PERSON	or any of his Majesty 's Frigates arrived at
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		I have directed a Transport to take on board a proportion of Provisions sufficient to last the Rose ,
Glasgow	LOCATION	, Swan and
Bolton	PERSON	until the end of March next , with a
Quantity of Stores	ORGANIZATION	of all kinds and Slops .

		I have compleated the Swan , and shall send an account of the whole to Captain
Wallace	PERSON	to be distributed as he shall think proper among his Majesty 's Ships and Vessels under his Command .

		And I shall send this Transport under Convoy of the Swan , who is to remain at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	until I can relieve her with some of the Ships expected from
England	LOCATION	.

		I have not heard from
Virginia	LOCATION	or the
Carolinas	LOCATION	since my last Letters , but am in hourly expectation of the Tamer and Cruizers Arrival .

		It is reported Captain
Tollemache	PERSON	has been at
Bermudas	LOCATION	with the Transport sent to bring the Ordnance from
Fort Johnson	PERSON	, but as he sailed from hence the latter end of August I can not think the Report is true , unless any Accident has befallen either of the Vessels .

		Chancellor and Vice Admiral of the same ー A Proclamation Whereas in the present unhappy and distressed Situation of great numbers of His Majestys Loyal and Faithful Subjects in several Provinces in
North America	LOCATION	grieveously oppressed and languishing under the Despotic Tyranny ー of a few factious and designing Men , who have from private views by misrepresentation and falsehood imposed upon and engaged in an unnatural Rebellion many of His Majestys well disposed Subjects , and selecting themselves into sundry unlawfull Committees , have in a most insolent and daring manner suspended the execution of the Laws and the
Authority	ORGANIZATION	of the Magistrate , and assuming to themselves the Reins of Government and an
Authority	ORGANIZATION	over all Persons within the respective Provinces now in Rebellion , using not only abuse and threats , but inflicting actual and unprecedented punishments upon such as are firmly attached to their King and the Laws and Constitution of their Country or refuse to sign Seditious and treasonable Articles of Combination and submit to their usurped
Authority	ORGANIZATION	ー And Whereas His Majesty from His usual Attention to the Peace and safety of all His Subjects in whatever part of His extensive Dominions residing And from his wonted compassion for the distresses of others , has been most Graciously pleased to signify to me by the Right Honourable the
Earl of Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	His Royal intention , and wishes , to afford every possible protection to such of His Subjects in the Colonies in Rebellion , as shall be too weak to resist the violence of the times , and too Loyal to concur in the measures of those , who have avowed and supported this unnatural Rebellion , And that this Province may not only prove a secure Asylum to such but induce them to settle here .

		His Majesty has been further graciously pleased to suspend the execution of the Instructions of the 3d of February 1774 respecting the Sale of lands for the present , but also all other Reservations and Restrictions , and to authorise me for the encouragement of such Persons as may under these cruel Circumstances be induced to seek a happy Asylum in this Province , to make out for them gratuitous Grants of Land exempt from Quit Rents for Ten Years ー I do therefore by and with the Advice and Consent of H1s Majestys Honble Council Issue this my Proclamation inviting all Persons suffering under the above Circumstances to come and reside in this His Majesty 's
Loyal Colony	ORGANIZATION	where they may unmolested follow their iawful occupations and enjoy the quiet possession of their Property , and the valuable blessing of that
Liberty	ORGANIZATION	, which is an enemy to licentiousness ; friendly to Government and consistent with the Laws of
Great Britain	LOCATION	And that upon application to me in Council they shall have Grants of Land as a Family Right under the usual restrictions and limitations , with an exemption from Quit Rents for Ten Years from the date of the
Grant	PERSON	, and every possible protection and encouragement .

		And whereas many of His Majestys honest well meaning and loyal Subjects in these factious and Rebellious times , where falsehood for a while may prevail over truth and force and violence in part over just Authority may be greatly imposed upon by the malicious insinuations and false representations of His Majesty 's disaffected Subjects .

		I have thought fit and do with the advice of His Majesty 's
Honble Council	ORGANIZATION	further encourage them to take up their Residence here , from the following considerations ー Vizt That the Climate is healthy as many of the Spaniards formerly lived here to a comfortable old age , and as from the establishment of the
Civil Government of this Colony	ORGANIZATION	under the Crown of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, His Majestys Subjects have enjoyed a state of good Health , which is particularly manifest from the Returns of His Majestys Troops in
Garrison	LOCATION	at
St Augustine	ORGANIZATION	ー that the Climate is sufficiently cold in Winter to brace up the constitution after the Summer Months which are refreshed by a regular Sea Breeze ー that several kinds of Grain and Vegetables produced in
Great Britain	LOCATION	may be cultivated here with Success in Winter ー Indian Corn ,
Rice	PERSON	,
Indigo Cotton and Sugar Cane	ORGANIZATION	in Summer ー that if it should be thought too expensive or the Seasons too precarious for raising Sugar and Rum for Exportation a Planter may at a Small expence and trouble raise
Sugar Cane	ORGANIZATION	sufficient to supply his Family with both ー that the Winter is not so severe as to destroy the
West India Cotton	ORGANIZATION	, but that it grows up in great luxuriancy in the Spring ー that the Climate and Soil seems peculiarly adapted for producing Indigo Weed from which the Planters have made Indigo of a Quality superior to any made in the British Colonies in
North America	LOCATION	ー that the Country is well pastured and fit for raising Cattle and Stock of every kind , without the assistance of artificial Grasses or laying up provender for Winter ー that the Country is conveniently intersected with Rivers plentifully stored with variety of Fish , and fit for Navigation and for bringing down produce and Lumber to the respective Ports ー that their Banks are covered with large Oaks , and other Timber fit for building Vessels that there is variety of other Timber for Staves and Lumber fit for the
West India	LOCATION	Market ー And I do further by the Advice of His Majesty 's
Honble Council	ORGANIZATION	, and in obedience to His Majesty 's Commands , hereby offer every Possible encouragement in my power for the exportation of Lumber to the
West India Islands	LOCATION	, and that I will upon application to me grant Licences to Cut Wood for Lumber upon any part of His Majesty 's Lands upon sufficient security being given , to Land it in some

PURDIE	PERSON	'S
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	GAZETTE , FRIDAY , NOVEMBER 3 , 1775
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, November 3 .

		The rifle-men and soldiers of
Hampton	LOCATION	desire their compliments to capt.
Squire	PERSON	and his squadron , and wish to know how they approve the reception they met with last friday -LSB- October 27 -RSB- .

		Should he incline to renew his visit , they will be glad to see him ; otherwise , in point of complaisance , they will be under the necessity of returning the visit .

		If he can not find the ear that was cut of -LSB- f -RSB- , they hope he will wear a wig to hide the mark ; for perhaps it may not be necessary that all should know chance had effected that which the laws ought to have done .

		It is certainly a fact , that in the late engagement at
Hampton	LOCATION	a rifle-man killed a man at the distance of 400 yards .

		Take care , ministerial troops .

		The seven white prisoners taken on board the
Hawke	PERSON	tender at
Hampton	LOCATION	had been treated with great humanity , one of them admitted to his parole , and another discharged ; but the negro slaves are doubly confined , and will be tried for their lives .

		A small squadron -LRB- commanded , it is said , by capt.
Montague	PERSON	-RRB- a few days since exchanged some shot with a party of riflemen at
Jamestown	LOCATION	, without any effect .

		The frequent depredations committed on the rivers by the tenders have provoked the inhabitants in every part to await their people coming on shore , when they expect to treat them with that riguor due to thieves and robbers .

		Between 1 and 2 o'clock last wednesday morning -LSB- November 1 -RSB- , it being very dark and .

		rainy , the sentinel on duty at the treasury fired upon some persons , whom he had repeatedly challenged without receiving any answer ; and suspecting they were armed , and that they might return , he hung his blanket upon some pales , and stood with his gun ready cocked to fire at the flash of their guns .

		In about half an hour a gun was discharged from behind the treasury , the ball from which struck close to the blanket , and the sentinel fired a second time .

		The captain of the guard at the magazine , hearing the report of guns , went immediately with a small detachment to endeavour to intercept the villains upon their retreat , and it is said saw three men at whom he fired , without success , it being exceedingly dark .

		Next morning several parties were sent after them , but could gain no other intelligence than that two or three men , in blue jackets , had been seen early that morning , near the creek , by some negroes .

		It has been suspected that capt.
Montague	PERSON	himself was the person , and that his design was to attempt to destroy the magazine or treasury ; and that his madness and folly made him return the sentinal 's fire .

		Whoever he was , he had a narrow escape .

		Mr. President reported the draught of an answer , which he had been desired to prepare , to Capt.
Thornbrough	PERSON	's letter of the 1st instant .

		And the said draught being taken into immediate consideration , was amended , and agreed to : In
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.


Charles Town	PERSON	,
South-Carolina	LOCATION	, Nov. 3 , 1775 .

		To
Edward Thornbrough	PERSON	, Commander of the Tamer Sloop of War .

		Sir , Col.
-LSB- Henry -RSB- Laurens	PERSON	, the late President , yesterday laid before us , your letter of the first instant .

		Before we make any answer to it , we must intimate to you , that as , by your verbal answer to a public messenger , who carried you a letter dated 28th ult .

		from Col.
Laurens	PERSON	, as President , you promised a written answer to that letter , relative to an information received , that a run-away negro , the property of
John-Allen Walter	PERSON	, Esq ; was harboured on board the sloop of war under your command ー so your unexpected silence on this head , at once is a breach of the rules of propriety , and a negative confession , that the negro , if not on board the Tamer , is actually harboured on board the Cherokee , the residence of Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	, or some other vessel under your command .

		The public , Sir , are too well acquainted with the arbitrary and irritating style peculiar to Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	's Secretary , for us to have the least room to imagine , that you are the framer of the letter you sent to Col.
Laurens	PERSON	, dated 1st instant .

		However , we can not but declare , that we know of no `` unprovoked insults '' the King 's servants have received from any assembly by authority of the people ; and we wish we could say , that the conduct of the King 's principal servant hath not made him an object of the just resentment of the public .

		Having declared these things , it may not be improper that we just hint to you , that we are not destitute of means enabling us to take vengeance , for any violence you may think proper to perpetrate against the shipping bound to , or out from this port .

		You ought , Sir , for very obvious reasons , to have been well assured , that
Walker	PERSON	, the late gunner , is a prisoner at the barracks , before you , in absolute terms , declared , that he is `` now a prisoner '' there , and threatened to detain a coasting vessel until he should be thence discharged and sent on board the Tamer .

		We declare , that
Walker	PERSON	is not in confinement at the barracks , and has not been in confinement there , since his discharge from thence on his parole several weeks ago .

		We do not know where he is : But , from the strictest enquiry we have been able to make , we have no reason to think he is within this colony .

		On the contrary , we learn , that Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	dispatched him -LRB- and that you are privy to his departure -RRB- to
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, with a letter , as
Walker	PERSON	himself has declared , to desire that a military force might be sent against the good people of this colony .


Walker	PERSON	was landed at
Savannah	LOCATION	, and we have not heard of him since .

		By the last sentence in your letter , we find you have been deceived into a belief , that Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	shewed great humanity to Capt. -LSB-
John -RSB- Wanton of Rhode-Island	PERSON	, who unfortunately fell into his hands , and that it was , bona fide , Capt.
Wanton	PERSON	's interest to employ
Walker	PERSON	, on board his vessel .

		We have strictly inquired of Captain Wanton touching these points , and from this examination we are able to say , that if Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	's declaration to Captain
Wanton	PERSON	that his vessel was seized under a late act of parliament ; and his sending the Captain , his crew and vessel to proceed to
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, under an armed force on board , in order there to be condemned , are acts of humanity ; it was certainly `` ungrateful '' in the Captain and crew , on the passage , to overpower the armed force , and to rescue the vessel from an arbitrary seizure : But as
Walker	PERSON	was , by Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	, armed , and contrary to the interest of Captain Wanton , put on board his vessel to command , and to conduct her to
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, and for the purpose of condemnation too , we can not understand , that in the execution of such a business , he was in the service of Captain Wanton ; or that Captain
Wanton	PERSON	was guilty of any impropriety in getting rid of him as soon as he could by landing him at
Savannah	LOCATION	.

		These things , Sir , having the greatest appearance of being facts , the most positive declarations to the contrary , short of absolute proof , from on board the Cherokee , will not alter our determination , or the opinion of the public on those points .

		By order of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB-
William Henry Drayton	PERSON	, President . -RSB-

		Ordered , That the said letter be immediately ingrossed ; and that Mr. President do sign the same , and send it , by the messenger , to Captain
Thornbrough	PERSON	.

FRANCIS LEGGE	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	No 49
Halifax	LOCATION	4th Novembr 1775 My Lord In my last letter Copy of which is now inclos 'd , 2 I inform 'd your Lordship of the intention of the Rebels to
Attack Canada	LOCATION	, and this Province , We have by the last advices from
Boston	LOCATION	been inform 'd that the Rebels who enter 'd
Canada	LOCATION	by the
Lake Champlaine	LOCATION	in attempting the
Fort	LOCATION	at
St Johns	LOCATION	on the
River Sorrell	LOCATION	have been repuls 'd with great loss .

		The great care of Admiral Graves in Stationing several Frigates in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	has hitherto prevented the Rebels from their design 'd Attempt , and as he proposes to Station two Ships of War for the securing the Navagation of that
Bay	PERSON	, I hope their Attempts will prove abortive , in the meah time I shall neglect no oppertunity of providing for the defence of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, two Companies of Accadians are form 'd in the Neighbourhood of
Annapolis	LOCATION	-LSB- Royal -RSB- , and I have given orders to form two more in the Neighbourhood of Chignecto of Accadians , also , and one Company of the Inhabitants of this Town under the name of light Infantry , and as the
House of Assembly	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- who have now under Consideration the ways and means of raising money for the defence ofthe Province -RRB- shall enable me to support and maintain the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	.

		I shall endeavour to form as many Companies as the Province will afford , but I am of opinion , that through the poverty of the Country the want of Specie among them , the great Burthen of their Debts , the levies of money which will be slow , and ineffectual to answer the purpose , and if matters should be brought to Extreme necessity , I shall be obligd to draw on the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	at Home for discharging the immediately necessary expence .

		I shall be extreme carefull on this head , as nothing shall induce me to such measures but the necessity there wil be of preserving this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, from whence His Majesty 's
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	has at present their supplies of Wood , Timber , Sundries , Picketts Fresh Provisions & ca .

		and can not otherwise be supplied .

		I have sent expresses to
St Johns River	LOCATION	, to endeavour to engage the Indians of this Province on the part of the Crown , shoud it succeed it will be attended with some expence , and as there is no fund established for such exigency 's , I shall be necessitated to draw for the same .

		unless this measure be adopted , as the Americans are trying every means to gain them over to their party , we shall not only lose the benefit of them for our own defence , but shoud they gain them to take up Arms against us , they woud be more formidable to the settlers here than an
Army	ORGANIZATION	of Americans .

		I can not but observe to your Lordship , that tho ' I have ever since the Rebels have meditated this design , press 'd General
Gage	PERSON	to reinforce this Colony under these alarming Circumstances , I coud procure no relief ; till within these few days , two Companies of the 14th are arrived , and about seventy of the Royal Fencible Americans and by a Return from Colonel -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Gorham	PERSON	of the State of the Troops here at present , tho the whole number consist of 390 : no more than 126 are return 'd fit for duty ー The Engineer Captain -LSB-
William	PERSON	-RSB- Spry is now employ 'd in preparing some Temporary works for the Security of the Yard , and I am of opinion if this disturbance in
America	LOCATION	continues , it will be a necessary measure to erect some Fortifications for the security of the Town , as it will then serve as an arsenal of Stores for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	.

		I beg leave to inclose to your Lordship my Speech to the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, and their Address to me , and as soon as they shall have finish 'd the business before them shall transmit the Laws & proceedings relative thereto .

		Letter No. 48 of October 17 , 1775 .

		REV.
SAMUEL DEANE	PERSON	TO
BENJAMIN GREENLEAF	PERSON	Sir : ー
Falmouth	LOCATION	, 4th Novr 1775 Our affairs in this town are got into such confusion that I am tempted to go out of my line and I know not what member of the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	I can apply to better than yourself .

		Such is our present dismal situation that unless something is done for us more than we can do for ourselves , we are absolutely undone , and shall too probably , if the war continues six months longer , involve the whole province of Main in our ruin .

		What we call the neck is thought by the best Judges Easy to fortify against the land , and not very difficult against the sea .

		Our harbour is one of the best in the province : perhaps the best of all : it is capacious , accessible & never is froze up .

		About 2 thirds of the buildings in general , the best , have been laid in ashes by
Mowat	PERSON	.

		He could not have done it if the 60 men in the province pay stationed here had been properly commanded .

		The company is by your honorable court put under the direction of a committee .

		The committee were so employed in gettg out their families and effects that they did not assemble to give orders .

		Individuals of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	gave contrary directions to the captain : so that all the opposition made to the landg of men with torches durg the cannonade was by volunteers , without any leader or direction .

		Last Wednesday -LSB- November 1 -RSB- the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	arrived in our harbour , a hellish name , with an infernal commander , yclep 'd
John Symons	PERSON	.

		He returned a letter to the Town , declarg that if
the Town	LOCATION	or Country adjacent should raise any armed men , abuse the Kings officers , or other peaceably disposed subject , erect military works & c. it would be his indispensable duty to proceed with the most rigorous efforts against the Town .

		The Militia is call 'd in , and they with part of the soldiery , are gog to throw up some breast works this night , so that we expect a cannonade at least to-morrow morng We have cannon that would be able to annoy the ship much if we had ammunition : But we have not half enough for our small arms .


Symons	PERSON	has asked for a few cattle and offer 'd pay for them and has been refused .

		After this detail of particulars , which I know to be true , I leave it to yourself to say whether it is not probable that our enemies will not be disposed to take possession of our neck and fortify it : whether they will not make it a place of rendevous for some of their ships this winter : whether in stead of a Committee it is not the indispensable duty of the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	to send us some able and experienced officer to be at the head of our companies that are in pay : Whether we out -LSB- ought -RSB- not to be visited at least by some skilful Engineer , who can shew us what to do , and what we ought not to do : whether it is not necessary to have more men raised here .

		I think the present number , scattered along the shore of the county mostly in places where they are not at all wanted is 200 .

		The Town has petition 'd Gen.
Washington	LOCATION	for troops .

		He has answered that he has no authority to send any .

		If some were sent , bread must be sent with them : for it is an article that this country could not supply them with .

		I conjure you Sr by your Zeal for the publick welfare to take our forlorn state into your serious consideration , and be a strenuous advocate for us at the honble
Board	ORGANIZATION	, and with the members of the house , as you have opportunity .

		If any of my hints arc good , I am confident you will improve them ; if you think anythg better I shall be glad to have them drop into oblivion .

		But unless you or some other of the Gen : Court shall cause some thg to be done for us I think it probable that in half a year the inhabitants of the
County	LOCATION	will be either prisoners , or else be driven so far back into the woods that they can not subsist .

		Another affair I would also intreat you to take into consideration .

		I mean the lamentable state of the poor of
Falmouth	LOCATION	, who have lost their habitations ; many of their movables , their whole employment : and are now livg upon the charity of those whom they will soon reduce to a level with themselves , and all , as far as I can divine must before Spring starve together .

		We have had a messenger at your court , and some of the members give him encouragement : others fling toryisms at us , and seem disposed that we shd suffer till we are brought to reason .

		But Sr is starvg the way to convert Tories ?

		If so the mercantile part of them will be converted first , as yy -LSB- they -RSB- are in general the greatest sufferers : But I fancy they will be the hardest to convert of any .

		Suppose this Town has not been so forward as they ought in the common cause : ought the province therefore to withhold Christian charity ?

		If thine enemy hunger thou shalt feed him .

		But the poor have not been wanting in the cause of liberty : and is it right that they should suffer for the aims of their superiours ?

		I believe
Charlestown	LOCATION	has been as faulty as
Falmouth	LOCATION	; and I have heard the province has reliev 'd its poor .

		I hope the province is not weary of extendg charity to their destroyed Towns .

		I think there will not be many more sea port towns destroy 'd , unless our enemies should increase amazingly .

		It is possible for me at present to tell the number of families that must have charity extended to them to keep them alive till Spring : or rather till they can raise something out of the ground next Summer .

		I should guess they are the bigger part of a hundred families .

		Some of the ablest towns in this and York Counties might take them and feed them for the present if the Court shall so order .

		If our destruction had happened in the Spring , the distress of the poor would not have been comparatively anything .

		Relying much upon your wisdom and humanity , I am , dear Sr -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Samuel Deane	PERSON	.

		P.S. Nov 5 .

		The Ship is gone : It is supposed to bring assistance , either to take possession of the neck or to destroy the remainder of the Town .

R.N. Sir Preston Boston Novr	ORGANIZATION	4 , 1775 I am extremely concerned that the
Sloop Phoenix Dean Master	ORGANIZATION	, 2 mentioned in your Letter to me Sepr 22d , is not yet condemned , what the Reasons are I know not , but there is the most unaccountable Reluctance to condemn Vessels evidently guilty of Breaches of the restraining Acts ; And now the Judge begins to doubt the competency of his own Jurisdiction , when he knows there is no other part of the Continent except
Halifax	LOCATION	where any of the Kings Courts can be held .

		A very fine Schooner with Gin on board and other prohibited Articles taken in or near the
Delaware	LOCATION	has been a month in the
Admiralty Court	ORGANIZATION	for Condemnation , and the Cause at last thrown out for the Reasons above mentioned .

		You may depend that if the
Phoenix	LOCATION	is not condemned I will seize her for the Kings Use on your Report .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO CAPTAIN
JAMES WALLACE	PERSON	,
R.N. Sir Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	4 Novr 1775 .

		The Account you have sent me of your proceedings with his Majesty 's Ships and Vessels under your Command at
Newport	LOCATION	and
Bristol	LOCATION	in your Letter October 14 meets my full Approbation .

		People so abominably hardened in the most ungrateful Rebellion against their Parent State deserve no favor , every Indulgence already shewn them , instead of procuring suitable Returns of dutiful Obedience to his Majesty and Submission to the Laws , has only encouraged them to commit farther Violences , therefore they must now expect to be severely dealt with .

		I believe the day after the Viper sailed the Raven brought me the long wished for Orders , which , as I expected , ought to have been here two months sooner .

		These have occasioned me to determine the old Code and instead thereof to issue another with additional Orders better adapted to the times .

		You receive a Set of each for the Rose ,
Glasgow	LOCATION	, and
Bolton	PERSON	.

		The Viper 's are delivered to her Captain .

		It therefore only remains for us to make the most of our time before the severe Weather sets in , by harrassing and destroying the Rebels and their Property , where the latter can not be brought off to compel them to submit .

		Altho ' the Swan is not in a fit condition to be much longer on Service without being hove down , yet her Captain being so well acquainted determines me to send her back to you again until I can relieve her with either a good Sloop or Frigate ; and indeed for other Reasons , To strengthen your Force and to convoy a Transport to you with
Stores	ORGANIZATION	; Slops and Provisions , of which I shall write particularly in another Letter .

		The Rebels of the Continent must not be allowed to fortify themselves on
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, or to remain there if you can by any means hinder it .

		And whatever Resentment the Inhabitants may apprehend from the whole Continent , their not assisting to drive out the Rebels will inevitably bring upon them the destruction of the Town of
Newport	LOCATION	by the King 's Ships , which I fancy in its Consequences will be more prejudicial to them than any punishment of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will therefore be a very wise part in the Inhabitants of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	to avert the imgending blow by instantly declaring themselves to be on the Side of Government and by heartily uniting with you to repel the common Enemy .

		As you must be the best Judge how far it is practicable with your present force to carry on any operations against the Rebels in the
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	, I will not pretend to direct .

		The preserving
Rhode Island	LOCATION	is an Object that in my Opinion all other Considerations must yield to , I will therefore only express my earnest Desire that you will scourge the Rebels whenever Opportunity presents itself ; Constantly remembering to distinguish , as you have hitherto done , the well affected to the King and Sufferers in his Cause from those who violently and wickedly are attempting to overturn the Constitution I am & c.

Two Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, Transport ,
Isaac Robinson Master	PERSON	, intended for his Majesty 's Ships Rose and
Glasgow	LOCATION	but to be distributed according to your Orders and the Necessities of the Ships with you .

		Inclosed is also an Account containing the Numbers and Contents and
Quantities of Provisions	ORGANIZATION	sent also for your Ships together with a
Parcel of Stores	ORGANIZATION	, the whole to be supplied by your Order , and for which you are to be very careful to cause regular and proper Receipts to be given : For the Provisions Tripiclates in the names of the Masters of the Transports from whence each Species was taken ; and for the Slops and Stores , to Mr
William Fowler	PERSON	his Majesty 's Naval Officer at
Boston	LOCATION	, by the respective Officers who shall receive the same .

		You have also an Account of what Stores and Slops have been supplied , particularly to the Swan , in Order that you may be fully informed of the State of your Ships with respect to the Stores , Slops and Provisions , as we may not be able to send you any more before the Spring .

		I would have you clear the Transport as soon as possible , and load her with Hay and
Wood	PERSON	, but as much of the former as can be got , for we have live Cattle but no Fodder , and are daily expecting to receive more Stock without a Prospect of their subsisting .

		Government has contracted with Mr
Robert Grant	PERSON	for his Agents here to furnish fresh Beef upon
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, so that the Crown defraying the whole Expence attending the supplying it to the Ships , Cattle are buying in all Places and generally arrive at
Boston	LOCATION	with only a few days Hay , where that Article is not to be had .

		Mr -LSB-
Alexander -RSB- Brymer	PERSON	the Contractors Agent here has given Mr
Robinson Master	PERSON	of the Transport Orders to buy what he can get , the uncertainty of the Situation of things at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	preventing his writing to any other Person ; As I am sure without your Assistance he will return empty , I desire you will endeavour to get the Transport laden with as much Dispatch as possible and send her round under Convoy .

		If unfortunately you can not fill the Transport with Hay , you will order such Boatswains and Carpenters Stores to be returned in her as are cumbersome and useless on board , directing proper Accounts of each to be sent to the Storekeeper who will return the necessary Receipts .

EDWARD THORNBROUGH	PERSON	, R.N. , TO
WILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON Sir	PERSON	,
Tamer	LOCATION	,
Rebellion Road	LOCATION	, Nov. 4th , 1775 .

		Without the aid of any secretary , armed as I am with truth , I can enter the lists even with Mr.
William Henry Drayton	PERSON	, when his weapons are sophistry , falsehood , and the grossest misrepresentation .

		On after consideration , I did not think Mr.
Laurens	PERSON	' letter worthy a written answer , as I never directly or indirectly harboured the run-away slave of any person ; and I will answer for the gentleman who commands the Cherokee , that his conduct has been exactly similar to mine in these matters .

		It is not my business to enter into any detail of the treatment , the King 's Representatives and the other servants of government have met with , from those assemblies which you have dignified with the name of the public ; but , I have prevailed on his Excellency to favour me with an extract of his letter to Governor
Tonyn	PERSON	at
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, which I now enclose ; as it will enable the people of this Province , to form a judgment of Captain Wanton 's worth and gratitude , as well as of your candour and veracity .

		As I have some reason to think the original is in your custody , or in that of your emissaries , you will hardly dispute its authenticity .

		But , to the main purport of my letter , while I command the King 's ships here , I will procure provisions by every means in my power ; if the methods I am under a necessity of taking for that purpose , should subject his Majesty 's faithful and loyal people in this Province to any inconveniency , I shall be extremely sorry ; but , they are to impute it entirely to those who have plunged this late unhappy country into misery and distress , and not to me , who have always protected it to the utmost of my power .

		I am to acknowledge
Walker	PERSON	was not your prisoner on the late occasion ー he is returned ; in that point , I was misinformed .

		I shall only add , that I am here determined to drop this correspondence ; which , is a very disagreeable one to me : and , I shall only expect a speedy and explicit answer .

		I am , Sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Edward Thornbrough	PERSON	.

		-LSB- Enclosure -RSB- Extract of a Letter from His Excellency the Right Hon. Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	, to Governor
Tonyn	PERSON	, of
St. Augustine	LOCATION	.

		ー The bearer of this , is a man who says he was bound from
Newport	LOCATION	in
Rhode-Island	LOCATION	, to
Nantucket	LOCATION	, in a small sloop which he had freighted but in a hard gale of wind was drove to the southward , without either chart or quadrant , and with only two landsmen and a boy on board ; by a kind of miracle he made this harbour yesterday , and pushed in at a venture .

		The poor man 's dreadful situation fully proved the truth of his story , although he had no clearance from
Newport	LOCATION	; and the unfeigned joy he expressed when he found himself in safety , left no doubt of the reality of the distresses he has suffered .

		By the late acts of parliament , he might be considered as a legal prize ; but Captain
Thornbrough	PERSON	of the Tamer , and Mr.
Fergusson	PERSON	-LRB- who commands the Cherokee -RRB- had too much humanity to think of that , though we were all a good deal difficulted what to do with him .

		Return he could not and it would have been highly improper , as well as impolitic , to have suffered him to go to
Charlestown	LOCATION	, in the present situation of affairs there ; as he had been only nine days from
Newport	LOCATION	, and not above a month ago , was in the rebel 's camp near
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I therefore proposed sending him to
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, which Captains
Thornbrough	PERSON	and
Fergusson	PERSON	readily agreed to ; at the same time generously offering to supply his little wants ; and the man most cheerfully and with great thankfulness acquiesced This arrangement gave me the more satisfaction , as it enabled me to furnish your Excellency with many particulars you will be anxious to know , of the state of affairs to the northward by means of this Skipper ; who you will find sensible and intelligent : his cargo consists of cider , apples , and cheese ; and I shall be happy if it proves a seasonable supply of those articles to your Province , at this juncture .

		Captain -LSB-
Alexander -RSB- Innis	PERSON	has given him a few lines to a friend of his in the mercantile way , to assist him in making the most of it , and procuring some employment for his bark till the summer ; before which time he can not venture to return home .

		To assist in navigating this vessel , and at the same time to prevent any attempt to run her into any of the little harbours on this coast , I have directed the gunner of
Fort Johnson	PERSON	, one
Walker	PERSON	, an old seaman , and a poor man who has been cruelly treated by the
Charlestown	LOCATION	people , to go in her to -LSB- St. -RSB-
Augustine	PERSON	; and your Excellency will be so obliging as to send him back by the first opportunity .

Newport	LOCATION	.

		Nothing but absolutely evacuating the
Island	LOCATION	ought to be accepted , if we are in a situation to command those Terms .

		You will ensure so much praise to yourself and Honor to the
Corps	ORGANIZATION	in which you serve by obliging the Rebels to leave
Rhode Island	LOCATION	that I need not use any Arguments to enforce the necessity of such a measure , but perhaps your influence may exte -LSB- nd -RSB- much further , and by Persuasion or Force oblige the
Rhode Islanders	ORGANIZATION	in spite of Prejudice to return to their Duty and become good and faithful Subjects ; an Event which would afford me the highest Satisfaction .

		I shall send the , Viper back again to
New York	LOCATION	, where I am determined the
Asia	LOCATION	shall winter if a large Ship does not come to relieve her .

		I am told she can lie near the Wharfs out of the Tide , and yet sufficiently distant from them to make Boats necessary to have Communication with the Town .

		If they attempt anything against her during the Winter , I will assuredly lay their Town in Ashes the moment a Fleet can get up , of which I shall order Captain

		1775 I am under Such Restrictions , Injunctions and Engagements of Secrecy respecting every Thing which passes in

		This however is an in convenience , which must be Submitted to for the sake of Superiour Advantages ー But I must take the Liberty to say that I think we shall soon think of maritime affairs , and naval Preparations : No great Things are to be exp -LSB- ected -RSB- at first , but out of a little a great deal may grow .

		It is very odd that , I , who have Spent my Days in -LSB- Enterprises -RSB- .

		and Employments so very different , and who have never thought much of old
Ocean	LOCATION	, or the Dominion of it , should be necessitated to make .

		such Enquiries : But it is my fate and my Duty , and therefore I must attempt it ー I am to enquire what Number of seamen may be found in our Province who would probably in list in the service , either as Marines , or on board of Armed Vessells , in the Pay of the Continent , or in the Pay of the Province , or on board of Privateers , fitted out by Private Adventurers ー I must also in treat you to let me know the Names Places of Abode , and Characters , of such Persons belonging to any of the seaport Towns in our Province , who are qualified for Officers and Commanders of Armed Vessells .

		I want to be further instructed , what ships , Brigantines schooners & c are to be found in any Part of the Province , which are to be sold or hired out , which will be suitable for armed Vessells ー What Their Tonnage the Depth of Water they draw , their Breadth , their Decks & c , and to whom they belong .

		and what is their Age .

		Further , what Places in our Province , are most secure and best accomodated for Building new Vessells , of Force in Case a Measure of that Kind Should be thought of ー The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	have returned , much pleased with what they have seen and heard , which shews that their
Embassy	ORGANIZATION	will be productive of happy Effects ー They say the only disagreable Circumstance , was that their Engagements Haste and constant Attention to Business was such as prevented them from forming such Acquaintances with the Gentlemen of our Province as they wished But as
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was waiting for their Return before they , could determine upon Affairs of the last Moment , they had not Time to spare .

		Impressions , have been made upon them either by the New England Gentlemen , or at Head Quarters , much to the Advantage of our Cause I assure you .

		Their Return has contributed much to Harmony and Unanimity , in all smaller Matters .

		in the great material Questions there was enough of them before ... .

		2 I want to know what is become of the Whalemen , Codfishers , and other Seamen belonging to our Province , and what Number of them you imagine m , ight be inlisted into the service of the Continent , or of the Province , or of private Adventurers in Case a Taste for Privateering and a maritime Warfare should prevail , whether you think that two or three Battalions of Marines could be easily inlisted in our Province .

		What Ships ,
Brigantines	LOCATION	, Schooners , suitable for armed Vessells might be purchased or hired , and at what Price in our Province , what their Burthen , Depth of Water , Length of Keel , Breadth , hight between Decks , Age , etc. and to whom they belong ?

		What Places are most suitable , that is safest and best accomoaated , for building new Vessells , if any should be wanted ; and what shipwrights may be had , and in what Time Vessells compleated ?

		But above all , what Persons , their Names , Ages , Places of Abode and Characters , may be found in our Province who might be qualified to serve as Commanders and Officers , etc. These are necessary Enquiries , and I am very ill qualified to make them , yet to tell you a secret in Confidence , it has become my Duty .

SAMUEL JOHNSTON	PERSON	TO
JOSEPH HEWES Dear Sir Edenton	PERSON	5th November 1775 Inclosed you will receive a Letter which is wrote by order of the
Provincial Council	ORGANIZATION	, which met at
Johnston Court-House	ORGANIZATION	the 17th of last month , the Absurdity of having two Regiments of men in pay without a possibility of their being of any Service for want of Arms and Ammunition was too striking to escape the observation of any one several Schemes were proposed to remedy this inconvenience , as the least exceptionable , that mentioned in the enclosed Letter was adopted , tho in my opinion wholly inadequate to the purpose as I have no doubt the men will be disbanded before there can be any returns , and as from the begining I was perfectly convinced of the impropriety of raising the Troops so now I am well satisfied that they will answer every purpose of those who were the most sanguine for the Measure equally well without Arms as with them I could therefore have wished that the general
Association	ORGANIZATION	had not been infringed without a real necessity ; but the general sense of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	was for the measure and I was in no condition at that time to wrangle , being too heavily affiicted with Apprehensions for the safety of my own dearest connections and which the event proves to have been too well founded , to feel so sensibly for the honour of the province as I should have otherwise done ー One Blunder is always productive of others the raising men without discovering they would be useless without arms & ammunition has in order to remedy that mischief induced a Necessity of breaking thro the
Association	ORGANIZATION	, what mischiefs may arise from this last Manoeuver time will discover , I am sure no good can come of it .

		I hear Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	is at Logger heads with the Virginians ; should our Governor have a small supply of men , the poor unarmed Men stationed below
Wilmington	LOCATION	will be in a piteous taking unless supported by the Militia which from the present temper of the inhabitants there is very little reason to expect .

		I heard yesterday that Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	had stationed a tender at Oc -LSB- r -RSB- acock and that she had already taken two vessells laden with Salt , one of them supposed .

		to be
B. Baker	PERSON	's Brig. I am much afraid that our being unrestrained in our trade will prove a dangerous Trap by which many will suffer if these people are allowed to continue their pyracies and I can see no Remedy .

Cambridge	LOCATION	with all Speed , where they will be Sold for the publick Use , & where they fetch a good price if their Quality is tollerable ー Capt Coit has I find been so unlucky as to get aground again .

		I hope his Misfortunes are now over & that Success will attend his Cruize , which it will give pleasure to hear he has Commenced ー I hope the

Martindale	PERSON	is going upon too large a Scale , & that he will make the out -LSB- f -RSB- it of his Vessel too expensive ー the intention of fitting out these Vessels , is not to attack the Armed , but to take the unarmed Vessels , which Capt Martindale Seems to have lost Sight of by putting Such a Number of Carriage Guns on board the

		The Ammunition is preparing , 40 Rounds for each gun , One barrel of loose powder for priming & c & a proper quantity of Match rope , I doubt much Whether we shall be able to get the Oznabrigs which the Captain writes for , if to be had it will go the Same Conveyance with the Ammunition , there is no Swivele Shot to be had here , if we can not procure Some time enough Shall Send four Ounce ball , which I think will answer every purpose .

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	Dear General
Tionderoga Novr	PERSON	6th 1775 .

		Your Excellency 's Favor of the 26th Ult I had the Honor to receive on the 3d instant .

		I have long since signified to
Congress the Necessity of a Delegation	ORGANIZATION	from them to this Place , and in their last to me of the 12th Ult : , they -LRB- unfortunately for me -RRB- say that it did not appear necessary then , I took the Liberty to lament that they were not in Sentiment with me on the Subject , & to add that I thought it absolutely necessary that one should be sent , so that I hope soon to see some of the Gentlemen here , ー A Variety of Regulations are necessary to be made in this Quarter .

		A Task to which I feel Myself greatly inadequate , but which , if I had even Judgment enough to arrange with Propreity , the shattered Condition of my Constitution is such , that Matters so Momentous as these , should not be left to so precarious an -LSB- Event -RSB- as that of my being able to support the Fatigue , For General
Montgomery	PERSON	, tho ' endowed with shining Abilities will have his
Time	ORGANIZATION	so totally engrossed with Other Matters that he will not be able to attend to these , Should Success crown our Endeavours at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, of which there seems to be little Doubt , the entire Reduction of
Canada	LOCATION	will in all Probability be the Consequence , An Event which will open new Scenes ,
An Army	ORGANIZATION	to be forme -LSB- d -RSB- & properly disposed of in that Quarter , Provisions Ammunition & every Necessary to be procurd for It , Preparations to be made for the next Campaign , Proper Places to be determin 'd on and Fortifications to be erected to defend that Province against any Attacks that may be made on It in the ensuing Year , Small Craft to be construct -LSB- ed -RSB- here , that a Reinforcement may be speedily sent into
Canada	LOCATION	, in Case it should be found necessary to support what Troops may be stationed there , Gallies carrying heavy Artillery to prevent Vessels of Force from coming up the
St Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	, A Mode of Government to be adopted in a Country where all will be Anarchy & Confusion without It , and probably a Variety of other interesting Regulations to take Place , that do not just now occur to me .

		Your Excellency will do me the Justice to beleive , that I feel in the most sensible Manner the favorable Opinion You are pleased to entert -LSB- ain -RSB- of me , And I am confident General
Montgomery	PERSON	will not be less affected on what You observe of him .

		I do myself the Pleasure this Day to write that Gentleman & shall convey to him Your best Wishes & Respects .

		The vast Benefit that would result from a successful Conclusion of the Campaign , in this Quarter , has been so deeply impressed on me , that I have often regretted , that the
Operations	ORGANIZATION	were not commenced at an earlier Period & when commenced , that so much Tardiness prevailed in sending up the necessary Stores & Troops .

		ー That You my Dear General should feel an Anxiety , to induce You to ask those Questions , which You have done in so polite , & friendly a Manner , is what I can easily suppose .

		The Difficulties under which General
Montgomery	PERSON	has laboured , have been in the extream , & which he most pathetically laments , in a Letter to me of the 13th Ult : -LRB- An Extract of which I do Myself the Honor to inclose , Your Excellency , together with the Opinion of a Council of War held on that Day & which I forgot to transmit You , in the Hurry with which I sent off my last -RRB- , And in his Letter of the 23d Ult .

		he says , `` Our Reinforcements not yet arrived , at this instant I have not in my Camp above 750 Men & I wish much to send a strong Detachment to the Island of
Montreal	LOCATION	, '' a Manoevre which would have taken Place sooner , had it been in his Power or been prudent to have gone into , neither of which I think it was , & shall beg Leave to make the following Observations , in Support of this Opinion .

		At no Period until this has it appeared to me that it would have been prudent to have passed
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, Altho ' a sufficient Force could have been left for forming a Blockade , for previous to the Reduction of
Chamblee	PERSON	, & the Success of our Troops in replusing the Attack of
Monsieur Regouville	PERSON	who was sent from
Montreal	LOCATION	, with two hundred & forty Men & expected to be joined by the Inhabitants of three of the most populous Parishes , on the
South Side	LOCATION	of the
St Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	, in which he was disappointed to a Man , & which has in some Measure evinced the Temper of the Canadians towards Us , & given Us better Assurances , than any we have had of their friendly Disposition .

		for until then , their real Sentiments were problematical ; and about this Time too we sunk their best armed Vessel so that we can now spare more Men for an Attack upon
Montreal	LOCATION	, Which if not prevented by Other Obstacles , was General
Montgomery	PERSON	's Intention , as soon as the Reinforcement above alluded to should arrive , which took Place on the 26th or 27th & Concisted of General -LSB-
David -RSB- Woosters	PERSON	of three hundred & thirty five & Major -LSB-
Barnabas -RSB- Tuthill	PERSON	of Colo : -LSB-
James -RSB- Holmes	PERSON	's , with two hundred & twenty five , Officers of both in eluded , In the Numbers however he will be disappointed , as General
Wooster	PERSON	had returned four hundred & eighty four Effectives from
Albany	LOCATION	, but discharged Ninety Nine between this & Albany & left fifty one , sick here , & the Others too fell greatly short of what I expected .

		ー If a Blockade had been formed , before the above mentioned Events took Place , It must have been sufficiently strong not only to have guarded against the Danger of a Sortie , but to have prevented the
Enemys Armed Vessels	ORGANIZATION	, which greatly surpassed ours in Strength , from getting to the Southward of Us , & thereby effectually cut off every possibility of Retreat , which if they had been able to accomplish , the Canadians I do firmly believe would immediately have joined Mr
Carlton	PERSON	, but if a sufficient
Body	PERSON	had been left , that , to make the Attempt on
Montreal	LOCATION	would have been too weak for such a Service & if they had met with a Repulse , the Canadians in that Case would not have hesitated one Moment to have acted against Us , as Colo :
Allen	PERSON	in his Report to me Observes , and all our Hopes in
Canada	LOCATION	would have been at an End , But another Difficulty presented It self -LRB- and which I do not know how the Detachment which General
Montgomery	PERSON	proposed to send , or has sent will even now surmount -RRB- the Want of Craft to convey a Body of Troops sufficient to promise Success , to the Island of
Montreal	LOCATION	across the
St Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	, which is deep , rapid & wide , as no Craft can pass the
Fort	LOCATION	at
St Johns	LOCATION	to go down the
Sorel	LOCATION	, Which Obstacles would be immediately removed on the Reduction of that
Fortress	ORGANIZATION	, which I hope has taken place by this Time , & then I shall have the fullest Confidence that our labours will be at an End in this Quarter , Except from what Difficulties may arise from the intemperate Desire , our People have to return to their Habitations , My Fears on which Account I have expressed to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー If we had passed it wholly & could have got to & succeeded against
Montreal	LOCATION	,
St Johns	PERSON	would undoubtedly have fallen , but what a vast Risk !

		No less than that of the Loss of the whole
Army	ORGANIZATION	, the
Command of Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, Tionderoga & Crown Point !

		for no Retreat could possibly have taken Place , the Dependance on the Canadians uncertain & if they had found Us incapable of passing to
Montreal	LOCATION	, for Want of Boats , or of Retreating on the same Account , It is certain we should have found them opposed to Us .

		ー In this View of Things , I hope it will be thought that either Attempt would have been Injudicious .

		I do Myself the Honor to inclose You sundry Extracts of my Letters to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, with Extracts of their Answers , by which Your Excellency will perceive that I have hinted at several Things , which I conceivd claimed the Attention of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	ー Inclose You also a List of the Officers made Prisoners at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, the Return of the Non Commissioned Officers & Privates , is either Mislaid or by Mistake inclosed to Governor
Trumbull	PERSON	.

		ー Be so good as to assure the Gentlemen of Your Family , that they have my best Wishes .

		AFFIDAVIT OF CAPTAIN
JOHN WANTON South-Carolina	PERSON	,
Charlestown	LOCATION	District : This day personally appeared before me ,
John Wanton	PERSON	, Captain of a sloop from
Rhode-Island	LOCATION	, who being duly sworn , sayeth , that on or about the twelfth of October last , he arrived in
Rebellion Road	LOCATION	, near
Charlestown	LOCATION	, in the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	aforesaid , when Captain
Thornbrough	PERSON	of the Tamer sloop of war , caused his vessel to anchor under his stern ; and caused him , the said Deponent , to go on board the
Cherokee	LOCATION	, to speak with Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	.

		That after the said Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	had inquired into the Deponent 's case , he told him , that by the late acts of parliament , his sloop was liable to be seized ; and , that he should , in discharge of his duty , send him to
St. Augustine	LOCATION	; this Deponent apprehending , in order to be condemned .

		And afterwards , his mate informed him , that an officer from on board the Tamer privately acquainted him , the said mate , that Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	had determined to send the Depenent 's vessel to
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, in order to be condemned .

		That the said Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	, against the consent of the said Deponent , caused an armed force to be put on board his vessel , to conduct her to
St. Augustine	LOCATION	.

		That Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	did not make him , the Deponent , a bearer of any letter to Governor
Tonyn	PERSON	.

		That he , the Deponent , never did tell Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	, that he had two landsmen on board ; having in reality two good seamen and a boy , who were fully sufficient to guard his vessel .

		That on the passage towards
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, one
Walker	PERSON	, who , by Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	, was put on board his , the Deponent 's vessel to command her , told him , the Deponent , that he had a letter from Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	, to Governor
Tonyn	PERSON	; with strict orders , that if he was in any danger of being taken by the Americans , he should be sure to sink the said letter in the sea , with cwo swivel bullets , which the said Deponent saw ; and which , the said
Walker	PERSON	told him , had been delivered to him for that purpose .

		And the said
Walker	PERSON	also told him , the Deponent , that Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	's Secretary had told him , that the letter was , to desire that soldiers should be sent to
Charlestown	LOCATION	from
St. Augustine	LOCATION	.

		And further this Deponent sayeth not .

		JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA PROVINCIAL CONGRESS In
Congress	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
Charleston	LOCATION	-RSB- Monday , November 6 , 1775 .

		Mr. President , agreeable to the request of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, laid before them an affidavit of Captain
John Wanton	PERSON	, taken before
Peter Bounetheau	PERSON	, J. P. Nov. 6 , 1775 .

		Mr. President then laid before the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, a resolution , as proper to be entered into by this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, upon the present correspondence with Capt
Thornbrough	PERSON	, and the affidavit of Captain Wanton .

		Which being read was amended and agreed to , as follows : Resolved , That Capt.
Thornbrough	PERSON	's letter of the 4th instant , directed to
William Henry Drayton	PERSON	,
Esq	PERSON	; in answer to a letter of the 3d instant , wrote by him as President , contains expressions as unmerited as unbecoming the pen of a gentleman , and therefore unexpected from Capt.
Thornbrough	PERSON	.

		ー That because Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	has favoured Capt.
Thornbrough	PERSON	`` with an extract of his letter to Governor
Tonyn	PERSON	, '' it does not thence follow , that the extract was faithfully made : and this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	not having seen the original letter , or any other extract from it , ought to remember , we have just cause not to credit any thing from Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	, which is not supported by absolute proof : neither does the extract prove , that Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	did not write another letter to Governor
Tonyn	PERSON	, to desire that troops should be sent against the good people of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and that Capt.
Wanton	PERSON	's sloop should be condemned at
St. Augustine	LOCATION	.

		On the contrary , in the affidavit this day made by the said Capt.
Wanton	PERSON	, and laid before this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, there is reason to conclude , that Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	did actually write to Governor
Tonyn	PERSON	, as well to procure troops , as to cause Capt.
Wanton	PERSON	's sloop to be condemned : And as this important letter has never appeared to the public , it is not improbable , either that Governor
Tonyn	PERSON	has received it , or that
Walker	PERSON	has destroyed it , and that the extract in question , even if it is a faithful one , is from a letter written only as a mask to the other , and with intention , if necessary , to be delivered up to the public .

		Ordered , That Captain Wanton 's affidavit , and resolution thereupon , be printed and made public , with the other papers already ordered and relative thereto .

		You are to proceed immediately to
Portsmouth	LOCATION	in
New-Hampshire	LOCATION	, and complete the Works already began , to secure that and the other Towns at the Entrance of
Piscataway River	LOCATION	, from any Attacks by Ships of War .

		For this Purpose , you are to fix Ships and Fire Rafts in such Places as you find most convenient to prevent the Enemy from passing up the
River	LOCATION	.

		As great Calamities and Distress are brought upon our
Sea Port Towns	LOCATION	, through the malicious Endeavours and false Representations of many Persons , holding Commissions under the Crown , who , not content with bringing Destruction upon some of our principal Towns , are yet using every Art that Malice can devise to reduce others to the same unhappy
State	ORGANIZATION	; in Hopes , by such diabolical and cruel Conduct to please an arbitrary and tyrannical Ministry , and to receive from them in Return , a Continuance of such Places and Pensions as they now hold at the Expence of the Blood and Treasure of this distressed Continent .

		You are , therefore , immediately upon your arrival in that Province , to seize such Persons as hold Commissions under the Crown and are acting as open and avow 'd Enemies to their Country , and hold them as Hostages for the Security of those Towns , which our ministerial Enemies threaten to invade .

		In Case any Attack should be made upon
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, or other Sea Ports in that Quarter , you are immediately to collect such Force as can be raised , to repel the Invasion ; and at all Hazards prevent the Enemy from landing and taking Possession of any Posts in that Quarter .

		When you have completed the Works at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, and secured the Passage of the River there , you are to return without Delay to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, unless you find the Enemy are about to make an immediate Attack upon that or the neighbouring Towns ; -LSB- the above is rather to be considered as matters of advice than orders ; as I do not conceive myself authorized to Involve the Continent in any Expence for the defence of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, or other place out of the Line of the great American defence ; particular Colonies being called upon by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to prepare for their own
Internal Security	ORGANIZATION	.

Wallace	PERSON	might be fully informed of the State of his Ships with respect to
Stores	ORGANIZATION	, Slops and Provisions , as it might not be practicable to send him any further Supplies until the Spring ; and that the admiral would have him clear the Transport as soon as possible , and load her with Hay and Wood for

		CAPTAIN
WILLIAM COIT	PERSON	TO MAJOR SAMUEL BLACHLEY WEBB Sir : ー
Plymouth	LOCATION	, Nov. 7th , 1775 .

		Since I parted with you , I have made blackguard snatch at two of their provision vessels , and have them safe at
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	, and if you were where you could see me and did not laugh , all your risible faculties must perish .

		To see me strutting about on the quarter-deck of my schooner !

		ー for she has a quarter-deck ー Ah , and more than that too ー 4 four pounders , brought into this country by the company of
Lords Say	ORGANIZATION	and Seal , to
Saybrook	LOCATION	when they first came .

		A pair of cohorns that
Noah	PERSON	had in the Ark ; one of which lacks a touch-hole , having hardened steel drove therein , that she might not be of service to Sir
Edmund Andros	PERSON	ー Six swivels , the first that ever were landed at
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	, and never fired since .

		2 Now , that is my plague ; but I can tell you somewhat of my comfort .

		My schooner is used to the business , for she was launched in the spring of 1761 , and has served two regular apprenticeships to sailing , and sails quick , being used to it .

		Her accomodations are fine ; five of us in the cabin , and when there , are obliged to stow spoon fashion .

		Besides , she has a chimney in it , and the smoke serves for bedding , victuals , drink and choking .

		She has one mast too , which is her foremast ; she had a mainmast , but it was put in so long ago , that it has rotted off in the hounds .

		She has a deck , too .

		When it was first made , it was new ; and because it was ashamed of being old , the first time we made use of a clawed handspike , it broke a hole through ; notwithstanding , the wench knew it was directly over the magazine .

		Upon the whole , if there comes peace , I would recommend her and her apparatus , to be sent to the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	; and I dare eat a red-hot gridiron if ever they have had , or will have , until the day of judgment , and curiosuty equal to her .

		I hav n't time to give you her character in full , but , in short , she is the devil .

		But while I can keep the sea and light only on unarmed vessels , she will do very well .

		But if obliged to fire both guns of a side at a time , it would split her open from her gunwale to her keelson .

		Pray make my compliments to all friends .

		Tell friend
White	PERSON	,
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	is better .

		than all the
Rhode -LSB- Island	LOCATION	-RSB- and
Newport	LOCATION	to boot .

		My mast will be finished to-morrow , I hope , and then away goes your most humble servant

		A Proclamation .

		AS I have ever entertained Hopes , that an Accommodation might have taken Place between Great-Britain and this Colony , without being compelled by my Duty to this most disagreeable but now absolutely necessary Step , rendered so by a Body of armed Men unlawfully assembled , firing on His Majesty 's Tenders , and the formation of an
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and that
Army	ORGANIZATION	now on their March to attack His Majesty 's Troops and destroy the well disposed Subjects of this Colony .

		To defeat such treasonable Purposes , and that all such Traitors , and their Abettors , may be brought to
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, and that the Peace , and good Order of this Colony may be again restored , which the ordinary Course of the Civil Law is unable to effect ; I have thought fit to issue this my Proclamation , hereby declaring , that until the aforesaid good Purposes can be obtained , I do in Virtue of the
Power and Authority	ORGANIZATION	to Me given , by His Majesty , determine to execute
Martial Law	PERSON	, and cause the same to be executed throughout this Colony : and to the end that Peace and good Order may the sooner be restored , I do require every Person capable of bearing Arms , to resort to His Majesty 's Standard , or be looked upon as Traitors to His Majesty 's Crown and Government , and thereby become liable to the Penalty the Law inflicts upon such Offences ; such as forfeiture of Life , confiscation of Lands , & c. & c. And I do hereby further declare all indented Servants , Negroes , or others , -LRB- appertaining to Rebels , -RRB- free that are able and willing to bear Arms , they joining His Majesty 's Troops as soon as may be , for the more speedily reducing this Colony to a proper Sense of their Duty , to His Majesty 's Crown and Dignity .

		I do further order , and require , all His Majesty 's Leige Subjects , to retain their Quitrents , or any other Taxes due or that may become due , in their own Custody , till such Time as Peace may be again restored to this at present most unhappy Country , or demanded of them for their former salutary Purposes , by Officers properly authorised to receive the same .

		CUMBERLAND COUNTY CONVENTION TO THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL COURT
Falmouth	LOCATION	, November 8 , 1775 .

		To the Honourable His Majesty 's Council of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of the
Massachusetts-Bay	LOCATION	, and the
Honourable House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	, in
General Court	ORGANIZATION	assembled .

		The Petition of the Delegates of the several Towns in the County of
Cumberland	LOCATION	, met in Convention , humbly sheweth : That , in consequence of the destruction of the Town of
Falmouth	LOCATION	, on the 18th ultimo , this Convention met on the 31st , -LRB- and continued by adjournments , to this day , -RRB- to consider of some ways and means to defend this County , and also this part of the county , and in particular to secure , and take possession of , and keep
Falmouth Neck	LOCATION	in our own power , if possible , by our utmost exertions .

		Accordingly , we advised and ordered the most of the soldiers in the Colony service on these sea-coasts to be immediately set to work to make an intrenchment , to prevent boats from landing for the future , and , at the same time , appointed a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to view an eminence on said
Falmouth-Neck	PERSON	, in order to begin to build a fort , and keep possession and advantage of the ground from our enemies , with directions to continue what number of men was necessary and proper , besides the soldiers , to carry on the affair , and apportion the same on the several towns , according to their circumstances , situation , and abilities .

		While these things were in agitation , and before we had well got through , the Cerberus man-of-war hove in sight , and ran into
Falmouth	LOCATION	harbour and Captain
Symons	PERSON	, the commander , sent orders and letters on shore , copies of which Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	will be able to lay before you , if needed .

		The several towns in the
County	LOCATION	were sent to , by letters originating from the Honourable Colonel
Freeman	PERSON	, with orders and advice to raise half the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	.

		A number of the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	and soldiers repaired to
Falmouth	LOCATION	, as soon as their distance and situation would admit ; but , the weather being very stormy , nothing could be done till Saturday -LSB- November 4 -RSB- , when the ground was viewed , the men put under some regulation , and tools prepared to begin an intrenchment that night , -LRB- while Captain
Symons	PERSON	, not thinking it proper to stay and see his orders put in execution , came to sail in the evening , and went out of the harbour . -RRB-

		The men accordingly broke ground , and worked the most of the night , and have continued so to do ever since , in all proper times for working , each town having successive drafts from the Militia to supply the place of their former drafts , so as constantly to carry on the work ; while we have some who are fitting out the few cannon we have for use , with a small matter of powder we have got ; but our want of men , and want of powder , and other military stores , throw us into great anxiety .

		We would further beg leave to suggest that this part of the country may be of some importance to all the other parts , and perhaps we might say great ; here are large stocks of cattle , of all kinds , and fuel and lumber of every kind , together with masts , which have been beneficial to almost all the seacoasts on the Continent , and to
Britain	LOCATION	, and may be so again , and which would be extremely advantageous to our enemies , should they get the possession of it .

		We would likewise beg leave further to suggest , that although
Casco-Bay	ORGANIZATION	is ten leagues across from cape to cape , yet
Falmouth	LOCATION	harbour is the most likely ship-harbour in the bay to command the country around ; and must , in all probability , command great part of the Province of
Maine	LOCATION	, be it in whose hands it will .

		Thus have we very briefly presumed to lay before you our distresses and wants , and also our important situation in the present and future scale of American affairs .

		Praying that your Honours would take our peculiarly distressing circumstances into consideration , as soon as may be , and grant us relief , by affording us men , and such warlike stores , of every kind , as you shall judge proper , together with an able , faithful , and an experienced head officer , and an engineer and other officers , as you shall think needful ; and also organize the Militia in this County , that they may with the more ease and expedition be drawn out , on any emergency ; or otherwise relieve us , as , in your known wisdom , you shall think fit and see meet .

		And your petitioners , as in duty bound , shall ever pray .

		GEORGE WASHINGTON TO COLONEL

Cambridge	LOCATION	, November 8th , 1775 .

		Dear Sir , ー The shipwreck of a vessel , said to be from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to
Boston	LOCATION	, near
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	, with 120 pipes of wine ; 118 of which are saved ー another from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Halifax	LOCATION	, near
Beverly	LOCATION	, with about # 240 worth of dry goods ー the taking of a wood vessel , bound to
Boston	LOCATION	, by Captain
Adams	PERSON	ー and the sudden departure of Mr.
-LSB- Edmund -RSB- Randolph	PERSON	-LRB- occasioned by the death of his uncle -LSB-
Peyton Randolph	PERSON	-RSB- -RRB- , are all the occurrences worth noticing , which have happened since you left this .

		I have ordered the wine and goods to this place , for sale ; as also the papers ; the latter may unfold secrets that may not be pleasing to some of your townsmen : and which , so soon as known , will be communincated .

		2 I have been happy enough to convince Captain
McPherson	PERSON	, as he says , of the propriety of returning to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	ー he sets out this day , and I am happy in his having an opportunity of laying before them a scheme for the destruction of the naval force of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		P.S. ー I had just finished my letter when a blundering Lieutenant of the blundering Captain
Coit	PERSON	, who had just blundered upon two vessels from
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, came in with the account of it , and before I could rescue my letter , without knowing what he did , picked up a candle and sprinkled it with grease ; 3 but these are kinds of blunders which one can readily excuse .

		The vessels contain hay , livestock , poultry , & c. , and are now safely moored in
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	harbour .

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	Sir ,
Cambridge	LOCATION	Novr 8th 1775 .

		The immediate Occasion of my giving the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the Trouble of a Letter at this Time , is to inform them , that in Consequence of their Order signified in your Letter of the 20th Ult .

		I laid myself under a solemn
Tye	PERSON	of Secrecy to Capt. -LSB-
John -RSB- McPherson	PERSON	, and proceeded to examine his Plan for the Destruction of the Fleet in the Harbour of
Boston	LOCATION	, with that Care and Attention , which the Importance of it deserved , and my Judgment could lead to : but not being happy eno ' to coincide in opinion with that Gentleman , and finding that his Scheme would involve greater Expence than -LRB- under my Doubts of its Success -RRB- I thought myself justified in giving into , I prevailed upon him to communicate his Plan to three Gentlemen of the Artillery -LRB- in this
Army	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- well acquainted with the
Knowledge & Practice of Gunnery	ORGANIZATION	.

		By them he has been convinced that inasmuch as he set out on wrong Principles , the Scheme would prove abortive .

		Unwilling however to relinquish his favourite Project of reducing the naval Force of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, he is very desirous of building a Number of Row-Gallies for this Purpose .

		But as the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	alone are competent to the Adoption of this Measure , I have advised him , -LRB- altho he offered to go on with the Building of them at his own Expence till the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should decide -RRB- to repair immediately to
Philada	LOCATION	with his Proposals , where if they should be agreed to , or Vessels of superiour Force agreeable to the Wishes of most othere should be resolved on , he may set instantly about them with the Materials upon the Spot .

		Here they are to collect .

		To him therefore I refer for further Information on this Head .

		A Vessel said to be from
Philada	LOCATION	and bound to
Boston	LOCATION	with 120 Pipes of Wine -LRB- 118 of which are secured -RRB- stranded at a Place called
Eastham	LOCATION	in a Gale of Wind , on the 2d ー Inst ー another from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Halifax	LOCATION	with dry Goods & c amounting per Invoice to about # 240 lawful got disabled in the same
Gale	PERSON	near
Beverly	LOCATION	.

		2 These Cargoes , with the Papers , I have ordered to this Place , the Vessels to be taken Care of till forther Orders .

		I have also an Account of the taking of a Wood Sloop bound to
Boston	LOCATION	, and carried into
Portsmouth	LOCATION	by one of our armed Vessels , Particulars not yet come to Hand ; and this Instant of two others from
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	to
Boston	LOCATION	with Hay ,
Wood	PERSON	, live Stock & c by another of our armed Schooners .

		These are in
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	.

		These Accidents and Captures point out the Necessity of establishing proper Courts without Loss of Time for the Decision of Property , and the Legallity of Seizures : otherwise I may be involved in inextricable Difficulties .

		Our Prisoners by the Reduction of
Fort Chamblee	LOCATION	-LRB- on which happy Event I most sincerely congratulate the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- being considerably augmented and likely to be encreased , I submit it to the Wisdom of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	whether some convenient inland Towns remote from the Post Roads ought not to be assigned them the Manner of their Treatment ー Subsistance & c defined , and a Commissary , or Agent , appointed to see that
Justice	ORGANIZATION	is done both to them & the Public ー proper Accounts rendered & c. Without a Mode of this Sort is adopted , I fear there will be sad Confusion hereafter , as there are great Complaints already .

		I reckoned without my Host when I informed the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in my last that I should in , a Day , or two , be able to acquaint them of the Disposition of the Soldiery towards a new Inlistment .

		I have been in Consultation with the Generals of this
Army	ORGANIZATION	ever since Thursday last -LSB- November 2 -RSB- , endeavouring to establish new
Corps of Officers	ORGANIZATION	, but find so many Doubts & Difficulties to reconcile , I can not say when they are to end , or what may be the Consequences , as there appears to be such an Unwillingness in the officers of one Government mixing in the same Regiment with those of another , and without many must be dismissed who are willing to serve , notwithstanding we are deficient on the whole .

		I am to have another Meeting today upon this Business , and shall inform you of the Result .

		The Council of Officers are unanimously of Opinion that the Command of the Artillery should no longer continue in Col : -LSB-
Richard -RSB- Gridley	PERSON	; and knowing of no Person better qualified to supply his Place , or whose Appointment will give more general Satisfaction , have taken the Liberty of recommending
Henry Knox Esqr	PERSON	to the Consideration of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, thinking it indispensably necessary at the same Time that this Regiment should consist of two Lieut Colonels , two Majors , and twelve Companies agreeably to the Plan & Estimate handed in , which differing from the last Establishment , I should be glad to be instructed on .

		The Commissary Genl not being returned will apologize , I hope , for my Silence respecting a Requisition of the Expence of his Clerks & c which I was to have obtained , together with others and forwarded .

		I have heard Nothing of Col :
Arnold	PERSON	since the 13th Ult .

		His Letter of , and Journal of that Date will convey all the Information I am able to give him .

		think he must be in
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		If any Mischance had happened -LSB- to -RSB- him , he would , as directed , have forwarded an Express .

		No Account yet of the armed Vessels sent to
St Lawrence	PERSON	.

		I think they will meet with the Stores inward or outward bound .

		Capt.
Symons	PERSON	in the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	lately sent from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Falmouth	LOCATION	hath published the enclosed Declaration at that
Place	ORGANIZATION	, and it is suspected intends to make some Kind of Lodgment there .

Army	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- who went up there upon the last Alarm , to spirit up the People , and oppose it at all Events .

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO PHILIP
STEPHENS Sir Preston Boston Novr	ORGANIZATION	8 , 1775 , The small Squadron under the Command of Lieut.
Mowat	PERSON	mentioned in my Letter October 9 returned to
Boston	LOCATION	the 2d instant .

		I transmit a Copy of Lieut. Mowats Account of his Expedition , and am extremely concerned the badness of his Vessels and Stores prevented his doing more than destroy -LSB- ing -RSB- the Town of
Falmouth	LOCATION	.

		This however is a severe Stroke to the Rebels
Falmouth	LOCATION	having long been a principal Magazine of all kinds of Merchandize , from whence , besides supplying the scattered Villages in the Provinces of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	and
Massachusets Bay	LOCATION	, large
Quantities of Goods	ORGANIZATION	were usually transported in small Vessels to
Newbury Port	LOCATION	and from thence by Land to the
Rebel Army	ORGANIZATION	round
Boston	LOCATION	.

		This is our first Essay , we shall in a little time be better provided , and you may be assured we shall not allow the Rebels to remain quiet .

		The Master of the
Halifax	LOCATION	having died on board of the small Pox , 2 and many of the Schooners Crew having never had that Disorder , I have ordered her to anchor at a distance from the Ships , and to have no Communication with them while any Infection remains .

		On the 3d instant the Viper came in from
New York	LOCATION	with the Mails , but last from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Wallace	PERSON	in a Letter October 25 tells me that Affairs remain there in much the same situation as mentioned in his last ; That the Towns People take great pains to remove the Rebels off the
Island	LOCATION	, and to that end sent a Deputation to the
Camp	LOCATION	, where there is a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	from the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and obtained Orders for the Rebels to be removed a greater distance from the Town and by no means to enter ; and to supply his Majesty 's Ships with every thing they want , upon the Ferry Boats and Market Boats being permitted to pass ; but Captain
Wallace	PERSON	says this he does not accept , but insists upon their leaving the Island and is flattered he shall succeed .

		Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	informs me an Association was proposed , about a Fortnight before the date of this Letter -LRB- October 18 -RRB- , to three Regiments raised in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	requiring them to sign to obey all Orders of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and to submit to military Discipline , which was refused to a Man .

		----- at
New York	LOCATION	has publickly changed his Plan and is now one of the most strenuous for supporting the Governor , who I find took Shelter on board the Packet , upon being informed the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	had recommended it to make him a Prisoner ; and though on writing to the Magistrates , he had the strongest Assurances that nothing of that sort was intended , and that he might depend upon the Support of the Citizen , yet he does not think these Assurances a sufficient Security .

		I hear also that the Sailors at
Philadelaphia	LOCATION	are much dissatisfied with the branch being taken from their Pilots , they say they are to be made Galley Slav -LSB- es ;] for the Town has built large Boats with a great Gu -LSB- n -RSB- in each , which are called Gallies .

		I transmit a Letter wherein particular mention is made of the Construction and intended use of them .

		The Swan sailed the 7th with the Transports mentioned in my Letter Novr 2d laden with provisions and Stores .

		I sent Directions by her to Captain
Wallace	PERSON	to make use of any method in his power to prevent the Rebels fortifying
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and to acquaint the Inhabitants that whatever Resentment they may apprehend from the whole Continent , their not assisting to drive out the Rebels will inevitably bring upon them the destruction of the Town of
Newport	LOCATION	, in its consequences more to be dreaded by them than any punishment the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	can inflict ; and that they will avert the impending Blow by instantly declaring themselves to be on the Side of Government , and heartily uniting with us in repelling the common Enemy .

		I have desired Captain
Wallace	PERSON	to let every other Consideration yield to the preserving this Island , and to endeavour by sinking Rebel Vessels in the Channel to destroy the Navigation of the River leading to
Providence	LOCATION	, which I hope he will be able to do .

		The Hinchinbrooke Schooner commanded by Lieutenant -LSB-

		CAPTAIN
BERNARD	PERSON	ROMANS TO THE COMMISSIONERS FOR FORTIFICATIONS AT THE HIGHLANDS Gentlemen ー Fort Constitution , 8th November , 1775 .

		Considering myself placed by the -LSB- Provincial -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in a very conspicuous rank , which requires it of me , that I should watch the interests of
America	LOCATION	as far as in my power lies , and having frequently observed , that the plan we at present pursue is a very lame one , for the remedying of which I have often offered my discourse , but as we are momentarily interrupted by our discontented gentry , I resolve to pen down and lay before you the following considerations in our present situation , at the post of
Martelaars Rock	LOCATION	, in the Highlands : The number of men now employed on the fortifications are 137 ; they being distributed as follows , vizt : Carpenters , 36
Stewart	PERSON	, 1 Masons , 27 Cooks , 5 Blacksmiths , 2 Overseers , 3 Miners , 4 Seamen employed as such on shore , 2 69 Do .

		in vessels , 4 Mortar makers , 2 Actual labourers , 51 68 Artificers as above , 69 Total , 137 This distribution is the most erroneous that can possibly be imagined , and must tend to retard our works ; nor can we pretend to do any thing , till better regulations take place .

		This will appear from the following estimate , which I judge to be right , but am willing to submit the same to the opinion of any able engineer or engineers : Each mason ought to have as attendants 2 stone breakers , 2 stone carriers , 1 mortar carrier ー 5 in all .

		With this assistance , each mason will with ease make 100 cubical feet of stone wall in 12 hours ' time , provided to every 4 masons one miner be allowed to work in the quarry .

		Thus it is evident , that our 27 masons , attended by 135 labourers and 7 miners , would have completed the 2400 perches of stone wall , contained in my estimate in 28 days of 12 hours each ; but to allow for extra occurrences I will say 30 days .

		Then it follows that 27 masons , suppose them to have 9s .6 d. per day each , including provisions , will daily cost # 12 16s .

		6d .

		Seven miners , suppose them 6s .

		provisions included , is daily # 2 2s .

		which will amount in 30-days to # 454 10s .

		N.B. Please to observe that in my estimate the labourers ' work stands as a separate article .

		But instead of such a regular arrangement , a very different one has unhappily taken place at this post , by which means only about 700 perches are done .

		What need have I to animadvert on so palpable an absurdity , as that of half of 51 labourers to attend on 27 masons ?

		I say one-half ; for surely the other half must be allowed for the attendance on our carpenters .

		But what makes it worse , this very day on which I write , I am reduced to the dilemme of keeping only 7 masons on the principal work ; the other 20 are necessarily employed in breaking and carrying stone , by reason that all the labourers are employed in unloading of vessels there being now 3 craft at the pier head ; and for fourteen or fifteen days past there have generally been 2 ; nor are we ever without one -LRB- at least , -RRB- to unload ; thus the labourers are all taken off , and men , who are hired at 7s .6 d. per diem , do that labour for the doing of which men may be had at 50s .

		per month .

		Where then is the wonder , that we advance not as we should do , and that the expense becomes great .

		With regard to the timber work , I have the following to offer .

		We are on an island where we have not a single stick of timber fit to do any thing with , except making firewood , and not even that , as most is a shrubby kind of pine .

		If we had it , the expense of carrying it out of the woods and bringing it to the work , would be to the amount of 10s .

		per 100 feet , especially if done by the labour of men -LRB- only -RRB- without oxen ; whereas now we have good oak delivered at the landing , at 6s .

		I will undertake and promise to build a block house , such as we have now erected , in 6 weeks , with 6 hands and 2 oxen , including 1 week as allowance for bad weather ; whereas now 12 carpenters and 20 labourers have been employed on the timber work thereof since the 10th of October , and will not have completely done till the 10th of November ; nor happens this by reason that the men are idlers ; no , but they are not conversant with similar work .

		It is true , they receive the timbers in a muddy dirty state , with a bad appearance ; but it is hewn truer than they are able to do it ; then to reduce it to what they judge to be a true square , they line it and hew half way down ; afterwards turn it , line it again , and hew the other half way : thus a piece of timber is lined eight times , and hewed to these eight lines , to make it worse than it was ; next the piece , through lack of oxen , is drawn by 20 men , to the place where it is wanted ; here the carpenters discover it not to be hewn in the square , and line it and hew it again eight times over ; then the dovetail is cut , and when put together , they see it makes bad joints , therefore have it to dub over again ; whereas the country carpenters , -LRB- used to such work -RRB- hew the whole side through by one line , and thereby leaves it , when he parts with it , truer than our people -LRB- unacquainted with such work , -RRB- can possibly do .

		The expense of one block house stands as follows : # s. d. The timber and plank , 14,000 feet , at 6s .

		per 100 , 42 00 0 2,000 shingles , at # 5 per M , 10 00 0 Much against my inclination and advice , 256 iron bolts have been used instead of so many trundles , These weigh each 5 lbs .

		is 1,280 lbs .

		at # 28 per ton 17 18 4 Carried forward , 53 00 0 Brought forward , 53 00 0 Necessary iron 275 lbs .

		at # 28 per ton , 3 17 0 200 weight of nails at 9d .

		7 10 0 Work of twelve carpenters , 30 days at 9s .

		6d .

		per day , provisions included 185 00 0 In my estimate no value of labour in timber work is mentioned , as it is of the masons , therefore I must add , 20 labourers , at 3s .

		per day , for 30 days , provisions included , 90 0 0 # 365 5 4 But according to my method of building , with such people as I could find , The timber , necessary iron , shingles and nails would be # 63 7 0 Instead of 256 bolts , as many trundles would not exceed 1 10 0 Six carpenters , 36 days , at 9s .

		6d .

		per day , provisions included , 102 12 0 A yoke of oxen , teamster included , 12s .

		per day for 15 days 9 00 0 # 176 9 0 The country carpenter is still inferior to the ship carpenter for our work , provided we can get him equally honest .

		From the above small specimen it is evident that even in the cheapest method , timber at this place comes infinitely higher than the masonry , and I am now convinced that stone towers of the nature of block-houses , would not amount to above # 100 each complete at this place , and when finished they are preferable .

		Among other bad regulations that have taken place here , there is one most grievously against the sound policy that ought to prevail ; beside the carpenters from the city , some country carpenters are employed who have a chief as well the former , and being a more diligent set of people than those from the city , have very deservedly -LRB- though somewhat injudiciously -RRB- some marks of special favour shown them .

		From this distinction sprung envy , who never fails in all similar cases to rear her head .

		I will only remark that such favours ought to have been shown in a manner somewhat less open ; yet in favour of the country carpenters .

		I must say that they labour harder and do not stand on the punctilium of stated hours .

		Likewise I believe had the country carpenters been first engaged , they might have been hired for 6s .

		per day , and thus been an example to the others .

		The breach is already pretty large between them ; should it continue to widen so that it becomes necessary to remove one party , my advice is to remove those from the city .

		We have seen that the two oxen in one day drew twelve pieces of timber and four pieces of cannon from the landing to the block house , a labour which would have employed , according to our experience , twenty men for two days .

		In other matters this holds exactly similar .

		Therefore twenty men , at 3s .

		per day , provisions included , is for two days , # 6 ; and two oxen , with the teamster , cost , if hired for one day , 12s .

		; here rises a balance of # 5 8s .

		per day .

		Your winter 's firing will be impossible to get without oxen ; in getting that and drawing of timber , each yoke will do the work of thirty men at least .

		This makes the reason appear evident why I have so strenuously recommended the procuring of oxen .

		They will cost thirty bushels of corn and one load of hay per head in four months , equal to about # 7 ; and then , if care is taken of them , they will sell for the original price ; but if they are kept in the same manner as the two we have now are , I confess they had better been left alone , for you will want new oxen every fourteen days .

		The next and greatest grievance to be considered is the erroneous principle on which our labourers are procured .

		Instead of hiring them for a month , and thereby giving them an opportunity of harrassing us in the shocking manner they do , I humbly think , gentlemen , that you ought to recommend it , that they be enlisted for a limited time , suppose six months , be it under the denomination of pioneers , or whatever else may be thought a proper appellation for such a body .

		I can not omit mentioning that when I first took a superficial view of the ground , I judged it to be less rough than it proves to be .

		I likewise thought that there was more wood , which made me put down more axes , billhooks and spades than I now find it necessary , we being here in the very extreme of rough ground ; yet the number sent up is more disproportioned than even my rought estimate .

		I will point out the just proportion of tools as they ought to be given to the workmen ; it may be of use .

		In extreme rough ground .

		In extreme fine soil .

		1-10 shovels .

		1-4 spades .

		1-20 spades .

		1-2 shovels .

		1-16 miner 's hammers .

		1-8 grubbing hoes .

		1-8 Jumpers .

		1-16 pickaxes .

		1-16 wedges and cold chissels .

		1-40 axes .

		1-8 small crowbars .

		3-80 billhooks .

		1-40 large crowbars with claws .

		1-8 mauls .

		1-16 pickaxes .

		1-8 grubbing hoes .

		7-80 axes .

		1-20 billhooks .

		The mediums must be calculated according to the nature of soils between these two extremes .

		We can not work here without powder .

		I know it is scarce , but suppose it to cost even 10s .

		per pound , and that four miners make eight holes per diem with an inch augur , which require each 2 1/2 inch of powder , this will make twenty inches of powder ; now twenty-one inches of powder in an inch hole makes three pounds ; therefore three times 10 is 30s .

		and four miners at 6s .

		per day is 24s .

		together # 2 14s .

		and these four miners will break more stone than thirty men with mauls can do ; yet these thirty men would cost you , provisions included , 3s .

		each , which amounts to # 4 10s .

		per diem .

		Another thing I have to remonstrate to you , gentlemen : this is , that the steward never yet has been made to keep a regular book of the accounts of his delivery of provisions , & c. which , however , in my opinion , is highly necessary ; likewise that a person ought to be appointed who should take an exact account of what tools are delivered out in the morning , and to whom , observing at night that the same person returns a similar tool , be it whole or broken .

		This method is far preferable to that of throwing by a broken axe , maul , or crowbar , while nobody knows how tools are expended .

		In my humble opinion , the steward could do this without adding much vexatious labour to his present employment .

		The number of strangers who come nolens volens to visit us , is a gross grievance .

		A rascal , who does not vouchsafe to lift his hat to us , nor even avoids to insult us , comes in to our innermost recess and interrupts us perhaps at a time when we are consulting the welfare of the community .

		By noticing the above mistakes and properly amending them , I make no doubt but we will , in this day of need , save a great sum of money for our country .

		I entreat you therefore to endeavour the making the necessary alterations , in which I am highly interested , by reason that the rank I hold endangers me of being made the butt against which all resentment may break ; because if the present measures continue , my calculations will prove erroneous ; but if these mistakes in proceedings are altered as I propose , my estimate must prove true , or nearly so ; the power lies with you , gentlemen .

		I have never received any kind of instructions from the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	or
Committee	ORGANIZATION	that may serve me as a line for the regulation of my conduct , except that I understood their intentions were that I should give you my advice , and therefore consider myself in duty bound to be content under your direction of affairs in every particular ; but I could not forbear taking this liberty in telling you what I think the most eligible path to pursue .

		I am , with the greatest respect , gentlemen , -LSB- & c. -RSB-

Bedlow	PERSON	and
Grenell	PERSON	came up ; since that some variation in our distribution of labourers and masons has taken place ; though it is better than the former , it is still very absurd and only serves to shew the instability of our plan .

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES Sir By the General
Gage	PERSON	who sails this day I have the Honour of informing you of my Arrival here of the 5th inst , as also the Brig
Elizabeth	PERSON	loaded with Arms , Ammunition and Cloathing & c .

		The Dispatches I had on board for General
Carleton	PERSON	I delivered to Lieut. Governor
Carnake	PERSON	2 who has sent them to the General at
Montreal	LOCATION	.

		I had under Convoy the Jacob Brig with Arms , Ammuniti -LSB- on -RSB- & c for
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		I parted with her the 26th Ulto in a Fog , but she is this Morning arrived , and , as I have Orders on the delivery of the
Jacob	PERSON	to put myself under your Command , should have put them in execution immediately , was it not for the distressed situation of this City and Province .

		The Canadians unfaithful , and destitute of Guns in the
Garrison	LOCATION	, the Lieut. Governor has represented to me the use of his Majesty 's Ship Lizard , and desiring my Stay to protect , as much as lay in my Power , the
Garrison	PERSON	of Quebec against the Rebels , who are advancing fast towards it ; and as I have thought it necessary to comply therewith , I shall execute such Orders as I shall receive from General
Carleton	PERSON	for his Majesty 's Service to the utmost of my power .

		The Lieutenant Governor has requested the Marines on board the Lizard might be landed , as he had no Men in the Garrison to be depended on , and I accordingly ordered them to disembark which they did .

		I found here his Majesty 's
Sloop Hunter	PERSON	, Captain
Mackenzie	PERSON	, who has your Orders which I shall be guided by .

		The Money I brought the Governor has directed me to keep on board , thinking it not safe on shore , but to be supplied as Occasion shall serve : neither does he think it fit to land the Arms & c out of the Storeships but remain on board under the protection of my Guns .

		Yesterday the Governor sent me advice of the advanced Guard of the Rebels being within two Leagues and a half of the Main River , and desiring the Sloop might move higher up the
River	LOCATION	to keep a good look out on the Enemy .

		I therefore ordered Captain
Mackenzie	PERSON	on that
Service	ORGANIZATION	; he is within our Signals .

		All the Intelligence that I can learn from the Lieut. Governor is that
St John	PERSON	surrendered themselves Prisoners of War on the 2d instant , and are to be sent to
Harford	PERSON	-LSB-

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- Novr 9 1775 His Majesty 's Ship Phoenix Captain
Parker	PERSON	arrived from
England	LOCATION	; she had sailed from thence with a Convoy of Victuallers and two
Ordnance Transports for Boston	ORGANIZATION	, all of which had parted from her on the Passage .

		The
Nancy	PERSON	a Brig laden with
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	was one of the Convoy .

		By the
Phoenix	LOCATION	the Admiral received Directions dated September 2d , to give Orders to the respective Captains and Commanders of his Majesty 's Ships and Vessels under his Command `` to seize all Ships and Vessels belonging to
New Hampshire	LOCATION	,
Massachusets Bay	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	,
Pensylvania	LOCATION	, the three lower Counties on
Delaware	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	,
Virginia North	LOCATION	and
South Carolina	LOCATION	, or owned by the Inhabitants thereof , except only in cases where it should clearly appear , from their papers or from other evidence , that they were bound to or returning from some
Port	LOCATION	or place in
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, or his
Majesty 's Islands	LOCATION	in the
West Indies	LOCATION	, but this Exception was not to extend , or be applied to such Ships or Vessels as might have Arms or Ammunition on board , which were to be seized in all Cases whatsoever , unless it should appear that the Arms and Ammunition had been shipp -LSB- ed -RSB- with license either from his Majesty in
Counsil	LOCATION	, from the Master General and Principal Officers of the Ordnance , or under the usual Clearances from the Commissioners of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	: and he was to cause all Ships and Vessels , which should be seized in the cases beforementioned , to be carried to some British Port , not within the twelve associated Colonies , and there detained 'till further Orders , or be proceeded against according to
Law	PERSON	, as the nature of the case should require .

		But , as by the above Order the Rebels might draw Supplies of Provisions , Rum , Melasses , Salt ,
Naval Stores	ORGANIZATION	, Cloathing , and in short every thing except Arms and Ammunition , from either
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	or his
Majesty 's Islands	LOCATION	in the
West Indies	LOCATION	; And as it would , if given to the Captains of the Kings Ships , invalidate those Orders from the Admiral , which they had long before acted under , to bring all Vessels laden with the Articles above enumerated to
Boston	LOCATION	: The Admiral thought proper to forbear carrying any part of it into Execution until he could receive their Lordships further Instructions thereon .

		Indeed the Clause directing Vessels seized to be carried `` to some British Port not within the twelve associated Colonies '' was almost impossible to be obeyed in the then State of things ; for it would have employed half the force under the Admiral 's Command to convoy the Prizes into Places of Security apart from the twelve associated Colonies .

		The Admiral also received by the
Phoenix	LOCATION	their Lordship 's Orders dated September 7th to increase the Complements of the Ships of Twenty four and Twenty Guns and also of the Sloops The Ships by the addition of twenty , and the Sloops by the addition of ten Men each : And their Lordships Order July 14 , 1775 , to cause all Ships and Vessels to be examined for Letters , and to send to their Lordships all such as should contain any matter tending to aid , abet , or advise the rebellious proceedings of the Kings Subjects in
North America	LOCATION	.

		The Admiral was also acquainted by Mr
Stephens	PERSON	in his Letter of July 24 , with the
Navy Board	ORGANIZATION	having Directions to send a flat bottomed Boat in each of the Vessels hired to bring Provisions for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	and in a Letter of July 25 , with the Names of the Ships which their Lordships had ordered out as a Reinforcement : that Rear Admiral
Shuldham	PERSON	would proceed in the
Chatham	LOCATION	to serve under his Command ; and that Captain
Arbuthnot	PERSON	was appointed a Commissioner of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	to reside at
Halifax	LOCATION	for the better
Superintendence of his Majesty 's Naval Affairs in South	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- sic -RSB-
America	LOCATION	.

		In this last Letter were the following Words `` I have it in Command from their Lordships to acquaint you , by this opportunity , that they entirely approve of your Proceedings . ''

		By a Dispatch of August the 9th the Admiral was informed that the
Navy Board	ORGANIZATION	was directed to cause twenty flat bottomed Boats to be sent to
Boston	LOCATION	by the
Transport Vessels	ORGANIZATION	taken up to carry five Regiments of Foot from
Ireland	LOCATION	: and , by one of September 6th , that the Lizard convoyed the
Jacob Store Ship	ORGANIZATION	with Arms and military Cloathing and Stores for
Quebec	LOCATION	, and the
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	the
Maria Store Ship	ORGANIZATION	laden in like manner for
Virginia	LOCATION	; In which last Letter is the ensuing Paragraph , `` I have received and communicated to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty your Letters of the 16th and 18th of July , giving an Account of your Proceedings up to that time ; and in return I have the satisfaction to acquaint you their Lordships very well approve thereof . ''

		By a Dispatch of September the 9th the Admiral was commanded to cause the men belonging to the Ships and Vessels seized and detained to be distributed amongst the Men of War to compleat their respective Complements , and to bear the Remainder as Supernumeraries until further Order .

		Intelligence having come by the
Phoenix	LOCATION	, that arrived the 9th of some Transports and Victuallers under her Convoy having parted from her , the Admiral , being apprehensive that these by droping in singly and unacquainted , might be in Danger of the Rebel Cruizers , immediately sent Orders to the Mercury , who was the same day come up to
Boston	LOCATION	, from her Cruize , to go out again and keep the Sea a Fortnight longer for their Protection .

		Sir , Agreeable to the plan laid between you and General
Clinton	PERSON	, the light Infantry of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	under his Command , embarked on board the flatt bottom boats at
Charlestown	LOCATION	ferry , at Eleven o'Clock this morning under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel
Clark	PERSON	.

		About twelve the Signal being made from the Scarborough the boats formed into two Divisions and landed on
Phipp	PERSON	's Farm , abreast of where I lay , being led by Lieutenant Hutt of the Scarborough .

		Previous to the landing of the Troops I had placed your armed boat which carries two four pounders and six swivels , to flank a Causeway , which was occupied by a large body of the Rebels who were coming over to attack the Troops but upon her firing upon them , they immediately retired .

		As soon as the Troops had made good their landing , I sent a party of Seamen on Shore who brought off all the Cattle that was upon the Farm amounting to fourteen head .

		When the Troops were reembarking the Rebels appeared upon the Heights in great numbers and begun to fire upon the Troops , but they was soon dispersed by the
Scarborough	PERSON	's cannon , and two field pieces that General
Clinton	PERSON	had placed near the Mill on
Charles Town	LOCATION	side under the direction of Captain
Drummond	PERSON	.

		At two o'Clock the Troops reembarked without the loss of a man either killed or wounded .

		As soon as the rear Guard got into the Boats I ordered your Armed Boat in Shore to bring up the rear and to fire at the Rebels if they should descend from the
Heights	LOCATION	, Mr
Delgarno	PERSON	belonging to the
Preston	PERSON	who Commanded her performed that Service very much like an Officer and was of great use in covering the Troops by keeping a very brisk fire .

		Editor 's bracketed sentence appears under date of November 10 in the Diary .

		DR.
BENJAMIN GALE	PERSON	TO
SILAS	PERSON	DEANE Dear Sir , ー
Killingworth	LOCATION	, 9th Nov. , 1775 .

		In your last you requested I would give you an account of the progress of our machine , and whether anything may be expected of it .

		I now sit down to give you a succinct but imperfect account of its structure , which is so complicated that it is impossible to give a perfect idea of it .

		The Body , when standing upright in the position in which it is navigated , has the nearest resemblance to the two upper shells of a Tortoise joined together .

		In length it doth not exceed 7 1/2 feet from the stem to the higher part of the rudder : the height not exceeding 6 feet .

		The person who navigates it enters at the top .

		It has a brass top or cover , which receives the person 's head as he sits on a seat , and is fastened on the inside by screws .

		In this brass head is fixed eight glasses , viz. two before , two on each side , one behind , and one to look out upwards .

		In the same brass head are fixed two brass tubes , to admit fresh air when requisite , and a ventilator at the side to free the machine from the air rendered unfit for respiration .

		On the inside is fixed a Barometer , by which he can tell the depth he is under water ; a Compass , by which he knows the course he steers .

		In the barometer and on the needles of the compass is fixed fox-fire , i.e. wood that gives light in the dark .

		His ballast consists of about 900 wt .

		of lead which he carried at the bottom and on the outside of the machine , part of which is so fixed as he can let run down to the Bottom , and serves as an anchor , by which he can ride ad libitum .

		He has a sounding lead fixed at the bow , by which he can take the depth of water under him ; and to bring the machine into a perfect equilibrium with the water , he can admit so much water as is necessary , and has a forcing pump by which he can free the machine at pleasure , and can rise above water , and again immerge , as occasion requires .

		In the bow , he has a pair of oars fixed like the two opposite arms of a wind mill , with which he can row forward , and turning them the opposite way , row the machine backward ; another pair fixed upon the same model , with which he can row the machine round , either to the right or left , and a third , by which he can row the machine either up or down ; all which are turn 'd by foot , like a spinning wheel .

		The rudder by which he steers , he manages by hand , within board .

		All these shafts which pass through the machine are so curiously fix 'd as not to admit any water to incommode the machine .

		The magazine for the powder is carried on the hinder part of the machine , without board , and so contrived , that when he comes under the side of the Ship , he rubs down the side until he comes to the keel , and a hook so fix 'd as that when it touches the keel it raises a spring which frees the magazine from the machine and fastens it to the side of the Ship ; at the same time , it draws a pin , which sets the watchwork agoing which , at a given time , springs the lock and the explosion ensues .

		Three magazines are prepared ; the first , the explosion takes place in twelve , the second in eight , ー the third in six hours , after being fixed to the ship .

		He proposes to fix these three before the first explosion takes place .

		He has made such a trial of the effects of the explosion of gunpowder under water , since Dr.
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Franklin	PERSON	did me the honor to call upon me , as has exceeded his most sanguine expectations , and is now convinced his magazines will contain three times so much powder as is necessary to destroy the largest ship in the navy .

		2 I now write with the greater freedom , as I conclude by the time this reaches you the machine will be in camp .

		Lately he has conducted matters and his designs with the greatest secrecy , both for the personal safety of the navigator as to produce the greatest astonishment to those against whom it is designed , ー if this projection succeeds , of which I make no doubt , as I well know the man and have seen the machine while in embryo , and every addition made to it fills me with fresh astonishment and surprize .

		And you may call me a visionary , an enthusiast , or what you please , ー I do insist upon it , that I believe the inspiration of the Almighty has given him understanding for this very purpose and design .

		If he succeeds , a stipend for life , and if he fails , a reasonable compensation for time and expense is his due from the public .

		What astonishment it will produce and what advantages may be made by those on the spot , if it succeeds , is more easy for you to conceive than for me to describe .

		3 I congratulate you and my country in the begun success of our Arms to the northward , and the prospects of further success .

		Make my most respectful compliments to Dr.
Franklin	PERSON	and our Delegates , your associates ; and am , most respectfully Your sincere friend and most humble servt ,
Benj n Gale	PERSON	.

		In October 1787
David Bushnell	PERSON	wrote of his experiment to
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, then Minister Plenipotentiary of the
United States	LOCATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	: The first experiment I made , was with about two ounces of gun powder , which I exploded 4 feet under water , to prove to some of the first personages in
Connecticut	LOCATION	, that powder would take fire under water .

		The second experiment was made with two pounds of powder , inclosed in a wooden bottle , and fixed under a hogshead , with a two inch oak plank between the hogshead and the powder ; the hogshead was loaded with stones as deep as it could swim ; a wooden pipe descending through the lower head of the hogshead , and through the plank , into the powder contained in the bottle , was primed with powder .

		A match put to the priming , exploded the powder , which produced a very great effect ; rending the plank into pieces ; demolishing the hogshead ; and casting the stones and the ruins of the hogshead , with a body of water , many feet into the air , to the astonishment of the spectators .

		This experiment was likewise made for the satisfaction of the gentlemen above mentioned .

		I afterwards made many experiments of a similar nature , some of them with large quantities of powder ; they all produced very violent explosions , much more than sufficient for any purpose I had in view .

		The
Journal	ORGANIZATION	is silent as to when the report of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, which had been appointed on November 2 , was first presented .

		In the Adams Papers , MassHS , is a long memorandum headed `` Proposals . ''

		As
John Adams	PERSON	was a member of the committee , it is evident that these `` Proposals '' constitute the report in question .

		It reads as follows : Proposals That two Battallions of Marines be raised consisting of one
Coll	PERSON	, two
Lt Colls	ORGANIZATION	, two Majors & c -LRB- officers as usual in other Regiments -RRB- that they consist of five hundred Privates each Battalion , exclusive of officers .

		That particular Care be taken that no Person be appointed to office or inlisted into said Battalions but such as have actually Served in the
Merchant Service	ORGANIZATION	as seamen , or so acquainted with maritime Affairs as to be able to serve to advantage by sea , when required .

		That they be inlisted and commissioned to be held for and during the present war , between
G. Britain	LOCATION	and the Colonies , unless regularly dismissed by orders of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	That they be distinguished by the Name of the 1st and 2d Battalion of American Marines That a sufficient Number of Vessells be taken up , and provided at
Newbury Port	LOCATION	, or
Portsmouth	LOCATION	by the 1st day of December next for transporting said two Battalions and three Months Provisions , and other Necessaries .

		That said two Battalions be raised and marched to said Place of Rendezvous , by the 1st of December , and in Case they are not easily raised or there is likely to be delay , that the General Draught out of the Forces under his Command to make up , any such Deficiency , of those who have been employed at sea if such are to be had .

		That said Battalions shall be armed in the following Manner vizt a light Fusee , fitted for slinging ー a large Hatchet with a long Handle ー and a Spear , with thirty two Rounds per Man of Ammunition ー That a Number of Men be immediately sent into
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, to inform themselves of the Temper and Disposition of the Inhabitants of that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	with respect to the Present Struggle between
G.B.	PERSON	and these Colonies , and how far they may be willing or able to take an active Part in the present Dispute .

		That two swift Sailing Boats be employed constantly to ply between
Minas	ORGANIZATION	and
Portsmouth	LOCATION	or
Newbury	LOCATION	to bring Intelligence of the State and Situation of the Province , in general , but most minutley of every Thing , respecting the Town and
Harbour	PERSON	of Hallifax That as soon as the said two Battalions , shall be arrived at either of said Ports and the situation of that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	and the Town of
Hallifax	LOCATION	shall be known the said Battallions embark for
Minas	ORGANIZATION	and make their Voyage with all possible Dispatch .

		That previous to their Ar -LSB- r -RSB- ival Horses and Carriages , be privately engaged for their Use , and that on their Landing they immediately make a forced March for Hallifax and possess themselves of that Town and of the naval and other Stores there and if practicable of the Shipping .

		Note .


Coll Arnolds Expedition	ORGANIZATION	was supposed in
Boston	LOCATION	to have been against this Place , which caused the General to send thither
Shipps	PERSON	, and Troops , but not enough to make Resistance to two such Battallions .

		further the Country are entirely in our favour , a few scotch Traders and renegade -LSB-
Ichabod -RSB- Jones	PERSON	excepted .

		Should this Expedition by any Accident be found impra -LSB- c -RSB- ticable , these would be two Battallions of the Utmost service , being capable of serving either by sea or Land Should the Expedition succeed , the Consequences will be of the Utmost Importance , nothing less than the greatest Distress , if not the Utter Ruin of the ministerial
Navy	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	ー the
Naval Stores	ORGANIZATION	in that Place are said to be of such Value , the Docks and
Barracks	ORGANIZATION	and yards cost the Nation more than one Million sterling , and is the only Place at which shipps of War can refitt in
America	LOCATION	.

		These Battalions should consist of Ten Companies each of fifty privates in a Company ー the Reason for this is , that in fitting out any ship of War one of these Companies would compleatly man a small Vessell and two of them make a large Proportion of Marines for the largest .

		Should this Expedition succeed , which it most unavoidably will , if prudently managed , the Destruction of the Docks and Yards , and the stores , which may be brought off , will be an immense affair , and a Retreat can ever be made with Safty .

		But if a ship or two of
Warr	PERSON	, should be taken , in the
Harbour	LOCATION	, of which you may be certain , and the Place by Reinforcements held , untill a force superiour can be brought from G.B. it will unavoidably destroy , and defeat any operation of our Enemy for the next Campaign , as all their Transport ships may by a few Armed Vessells from this Port be intercepted before they can have Intelligence to avoid them ー INSTRUCTIONS TO
ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON	PERSON	, ROBERT TREAT
PAINE	PERSON	AND
JOHN LANGDON	PERSON	Gentlemen The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	expect that you repair , with as much dispatch as the necessary preparation for your journey will admit , to
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, in order to consult General
Schuyler	PERSON	, what number of forces will be necessary in

		That
Porter	PERSON	did not tell all , is evident in the narrative of
Luther Little	PERSON	, who was a seaman on board the captured sloop .

		Little 's account reads : After we had taken the powder and ball , and other articles for which we had orders , we proceeded on our return to
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		The news of our expected arrival had been noised abroad , and the King 's tender lay within the bar in wait for us .

		When we reached within a few miles of the bar , it became calm .

		Twelve pilot boats from
Ocracoke	LOCATION	came off to us , and informed us that the tender was coming out to take us .

		We loaded the twelve pilot boats with powder and they pushed off for
Ocracoke	LOCATION	, and arrived safe .

		The balls , which were in kegs , we hove overboard .

		By this time the tender made her appearance ; it being calm , with their sweeps they rode alongside us , and ordered us all on board ; made prize of the sloop , and ordered her to
Norfolk	LOCATION	, where lay the English fleet .

		The pilot on board the tender begged the Captain to discharge him .

		He refused , telling him he should keep him for a coasting pilot .

		He pleaded that he had a wife and eight children dependent on him , and begged hard for his release , which , through the influence of a lady on board , was finally granted .

		When the pilot and his crew went to take the boat , I mingled with them , and walked orderly on board without being observed , and immediately took one of the oars and went hard to rowing .

		The Captain and the rest of the crew were taken to
Norfolk	LOCATION	, prisoners .

		The pilot boat landed at
Ocracoke	LOCATION	, where I found that the pilots who took the powder ashore , had embezzled ten casks ; which induced me to borrow an old musket , and keep guard over it that night .

		.

		I had eaten nothing the whole day ; at ten in the evening I discovered a light in the woods about half a mile 's distance .

		I directed my course , by a foot path , to the light .

		When I got near the house , a large dog issued from it , and jumped upon my shoulders , and I feared would have torn me in pieces .

		I tried to coax him , by patting him , but he still hung to my clothes , until I reached the door .

		There I knocked and called loudly ; two women came to the door , who appeared the only inmates ; they said it was a wonder the dog did not tear me to pieces .

		Here , for the first and last time in my life , I begged for something to eat .

		They gave me some hominy and milk , for which I was thankful .

		After requesting them to detain the dog until I was clear , I returned to the powder , which I faithfully guarded the remainder of the night .

		The next morning the pilots finding they could plunder no more of the powder , agreed to carry it up the
Pamlico	LOCATION	river , to the several
County Committees	ORGANIZATION	for whom it was destined ; myself accompanying them .

		We landed this powder in three Counties .

		I was invited by the several committees to take up my abode with them while I stayed ; I gladly accepted their invitations , having left everything I had on board the sloop taken by the British .

		I stayed chiefly with the overseers of the plantations .

William Campbell	PERSON	's threats of hostilities against us ー have sunk deep in the minds of a people who , seeing themselves by the royal act , in effect put out of the regal protection , are at length driven to the disagreeable necessity of ordering a military opposition to the arms of the British ministry .

		But the people of
South-Carolina	LOCATION	remembering , that those who point the British arms at their breasts , and against their invaluable liberties , are their dear countrymen , and once were their friends ; unwilling , yet determined , vigorously to oppose any approach of threatening danger to their safety ; have directed me to intimate to you , Sir , as Commander in Chief of the British armament on this station , that orders are issued to the Commanding officer at
Fort Johnson	LOCATION	, by every military operation , to endeavour to prevent any ministerial armament from passing that post .

		COMMISSIONERS FOR FORTIFICATIONS AT THE HIGHLANDS TO CAPTAIN
BERNARD	PERSON	ROMANS Sir ー
Martlers Rock	LOCATION	, Nov. 10th , 1775 .

		Your considerations on the conspicuous light you have been placed in at this post , your watchfulness for the interests of
America	LOCATION	as far as in your power lies , suppose you mean in the expense that must attend our present works , with the many et ceteras therein , we beg leave to make the following reply : 1st .

		As to the erroneous distribution of 137 articifers and labourers at the post when you drew up your con ` siderations , about 28 carpenters and 19 masons have come to this post since the 20th Octr .

		You arrived here the 10th , and think it would have been your duty to have let the commissioners know the proportion of labourers wanted to the artificers , before the addition of the latter were sent from New-York , and we do not recollect that even then you mentioned it ; it has been latterly your complaint , on seeing the season advance , and our uneasiness that we had no place of any defence finished .

		To your judgment we submit what quantity of cubical feet of stone a mason properly attended may lay in twelve hours ?

		We confess our ignorance in this calculation .

		But this we certainly are judges of , viz. .

		If the work is well done , and the artificers keep close to it the proper time of working .

		The disappointment of one hundred men , expected up soon after we landed here , you are no stranger to .

		A proper attention should have been paid , in your mind , to the labourers that would necessarily be wanted frequently to unload timber , lime , brick , shingles and stores .

		2nd .

		In regard to your promise to build a block house in six weeks , with 6 hands and 2 oxen , you may perform ; but rerriark , that your account of the number of carpenters and labourers employed on the one now nearly finished is certainly much exaggerated , as to the whole time since the 10th Oct. .

		The carpenters not doing the work of it in a workmanlike manner you were to notice , and to have pointed out the most expeditious method , as we were frequently expostulating with you on the backwardness of our having some place of defence finished .

		As to oxen being cheaper than labourers to carry timber from the pierhead up to the heights of the rock where the block house is erected , may be just ; but you know that when we began said block house we scarcely had a road up to it , from said pier , for men , then a cart was proposed to be drawn by labourers ; a road was with great labour made for that , and a cart procured .

		About three weeks ago you proposed the hire of oxen , and three pair to be got directly ; one pair was agreed to , and every step in our situation taken to get them .

		A letter was wrote to the committee of the Fishkills to assist us ; a boat and people employed in messages to procure them .

		Three pair of oxen , or even one , ought to have bet ; n provided with forage , -LRB- none being on this rock , -RRB- before they were brought to this place to be worked hard amongst rocks : this is not the work of a day where we are placed .

		Your calculation of the extra iron in lieu of trunnels may be just ; but you will be pleased to observe , it was a case of absolute necessity , as you had never mentioned any thing of trunnels till they were wanted , and then informed us that nothing here was fit for such use , that only locust trunnels would answer ; those not being to be got , after many applications up here , the block house could not be left waiting for them , as our orders from the Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, dated the 28th September , was to get at least twelve guns directly mounted for defence , which you were made acquainted with on your return to this post , and frequently urged to get performed .

		3d .

		Your calculations of the expense of the block house , now near built , for this being the 10th of November , it is not yet finished , we think not exact in many articles .

		Necessary iron , we believe , you will find to exceed your estimate .

		All that we have to say farther on this head , is , that we were of opinion , and told you so , that there was no necessity of making a temporary work have an elegant outside appearance , and the inside to be lined with so much nicety and expense .

		You say , with your method of bqilding and workmen , you would find you could build such a blockhouse for # 176 9s .

		something less than half of what , by your estimate , you say the present one will cost .

		We should be glad to know who but yourself constructed , ordered , and particularly directed that building -LRB- except in the case of the iron bolts in lieu of trunnels . -RRB-

		Had the timber for it been ordered in pieces of length equal to the sides , instead of pieces of eighteen feet long , unwieldy for men to move and bring up on the rock , we should have had those pieces brought up with more despatch , and not have seen so great a waste of timber sawed from every piece , laying about the works ; no trifling extraordinary expense this .

		4th .

		We are at a loss to conceive what you mean by ー amongst other bad regulations ー one , and that grievously against sound policy , has taken place here , respecting some special marks of favour shewn -LRB- by us , suppose that is your meaning , -RRB- to the country carpenters , above the -LSB- New -RSB- York carpenters .

		Now we request you would point out this special mark of favor ?

		Sure we are , that the country carpenters have not been so comfortably accomodated as the others , having no fireplace to this day , November 10th , to go to , and according to your own confession they are the most faithful workmen .

		We have always understood that it was both just and sound policy to reward merit ; we have rather been deficient in this to those deserving men .

		If you had heard any unreasonable murmurs from the York carpenters , why was it kept from us ?

		As a proper inquiry might have been made , and if unjust murmurs , the persons guilty should been discharged from the service .

		The rest of this long carpenters ' affair we shall leave , thanking you for your advice at the conclusion , which we think would be very impolitic in these times to put into execution .

		5thly .

		As the oxen are again introduced with an estimate of the difference of twenty men 's labour , and two oxen with the teamster one day in which you make a balance of # 5 8s .

		0d .

		in favour of oxen .

		But you have forgot that this one teamster can not put on a stick of timber 12 in .

		by 12 , eighteen feet long on the carriage by himself , nor put it down when at the place wanted .

		We have had a pretty good sample this day in the oxen carrying off stone , when six men were employed to put the stone on and support it all the way to where it was thrown off .

		We are apprehensive your calculations of the cost of hay and corn for two oxen , four months is below the mark , as we will soon be convinced of .

		However , on the whole , we join with you in the necessity of having them at this place , and that a vast saving will be made by using such .

		The reason why they were not procured sooner we have already mentioned .

		6thly .

		In regard to the erroneous principle you say our labourers are hired on , you may be very right in , could it have been carried into execution on our first coming here -LRB- if you had then mentioned it -RRB- , which is some doubt with us as the times are .

		7thly .

		The superficial views you say you took of the ground when you first came up here was a great error .

		It should have been minutely examined to have made a proper estimate of works to be erected here .

		As to the estimate , you never favoured us with it , we wish you had , it might have been of some service then , it can be of little now , amongst your considerations presented to us .

		All the necessary tools , wheel-barrows , & c. brought to this post were procured without any direction from you .

		In your estimate of the expenses of the barracks and stores you have forgot glass for the windows , iron , the freight of boards and shingles , unless the freight of the two latter articles are included in your incidental requisites .

		8thly .

		As to the article of not being able to do without miners is a doubt with us , we , however , submitted to some being employed for taking away a large part of a rock to the NW .

		of the block house , although powder was scarce with us and not sent up for such service , twenty odd weight of which has been already expended .

		We are satisfied to have two miners employed for the purpose of taking away rocks that can not be removed without , as soon as we have powder sent up for that service , which we have applied for ; but to have four employed to blast stone for the works we presume would be very expensive indeed , as stone enough can be procured all around us and brought with the team to the works .

		When after a blast is made the large pieces are to be worked upon by labourers with mauls to make them portable .

		9thly .

		On what view you have interfered with the steward 's office you best know , in your directions about delivering out the provisions .

		We know what provisions are received , what number of hands every day to be victualled , and he keeps an account of provisions expended .

		If it has proceeded from a suspicion that more provisions may be delivered out than is necessary , by which an extraordinary expence will arise .

		We wish you would consider how often we have requested you to send from this post your negro which we now insist on , who is a nuisance , and has caused more dissatisfaction amongst the people than ever we could learn from any particular favour shown to the country carpenters , Your addition of a clerk for yourself is an officer we can by no means allow of , and for the above reason desire if you retain him , to pay and provide provision for him at your own expense .

		You can not have forgot when you recommended Mr.
Vandome	PERSON	to Messrs. -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Bayard -LSB- William -RSB- Bedlow	PERSON	and -LSB-
John -RSB- Hanson	PERSON	, that he was to assist you in your writing .

		10thly .

		As to the number of unwelcome guests we so frequently have had , you know it has never met with our approbation and have frequently informed the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the impropriety of suffering it .

		Lastly .

		As to your entreaty to make the necessary alterations you have recommended in your conclusion , we think the above a sufficient reply , and could any alteration in this advanced season of the year take place to advance the fortification , no persons would more gladly embrace them to further the public service we are engaged in , as we think ourselves as much interested to do it in the rank the
Honble Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	of this Province have placed us in , as possibly you can be .

		We know the power we are invested with , and will be glad to see you not interrupt them by assuming the sole direction in every thing here .

		Upon the whole we assure you , sir , we have no other desire than to treat you as a gentleman who has an important trust comitted -LRB- with us -RRB- to your charge ; therefore , to avoid every thing that should interrupt that harmony that ought to subsist among persons employed in the cause of American liberty , do desire that when you want to have any piece of work done we may come together and consult about it , that we may approve or not .

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	Sir ,
Cambridge Novr	LOCATION	.

		11th .

		1775 I had the Honour to address myself to you the 8th .

		Inst by Capt.
Macpherson	PERSON	, since which I have an Account of a Schooner laden chiefly with Fire-Wood being brought into
Marblehead	LOCATION	by the armed
Schooner Lee Capt Manly	ORGANIZATION	.

		She had on Board , the Master , a Midshipman , two Marines , and four Sailors from the Cerberus Man of War , who had made a Prize of this Schooner a few Days before , and was sending her into
Harbour	LOCATION	.

		2 Inclosed you have a Copy of an Act passed this Session by the
Honble Council & House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	of this Province .

		It respects such Captures , as may be made by Vessels fitted out by the Province , or by Individuals thereof .

		3 As the armed Vessels fitted at the Continental Expence do not come under this Law , I would have it submitted to the
Consideration of Congress	ORGANIZATION	to point out a more summary Way of proceeding to determine the Property and Mode of Condemnation , of such Prizes as have been , or hereafter may be made , than is specified in this Act .

		Should not a Court be established by
Authority of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, to take Cognizance of Prizes made by the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Vessels ?

		Whatever the Mode is which they are pleased to adopt , there is an absolute Necessity of its being speedily determined on ; for I can not spare Time from military Affairs to give proper Attention to these Matters .

		The Inhabitants of
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	have taken a Sloop laden with Provisions & c. from
Halifax	LOCATION	bound to
Boston	LOCATION	, and the Inhabitants of
Beverly	LOCATION	, have , under Cover of one of the armed Schooners , taken a Vessel from
Ireland	LOCATION	, laden with Beef , Pork , Butter , & c. for -LSB- the -RSB- same place .

		4 The Latter brings Papers & Letters of a very interesting Nature , which are in the Hands of the
Honble Council	ORGANIZATION	, who informed me they will transmit them to you by this Conveyance .

		To the Contents of these Papers and Letters , I must beg Leave to refer you and the
Honble Congress	ORGANIZATION	, who will now see the absolute Necessity there is of exerting all their Wisdom to withstand the mighty Efforts of our Enemies .

		The Trouble I have in the Arrangement of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	is really inconceivable .

		Many of the Officers sent in their Names to serve in Expectation of Promotion .

		Others stood aloof to see what Advantage they could make for themselves , whilst a Number who have declined , have again sent in their Names to serve .

		So great has the Confusion arising from these , and many other perplexing Circumstances been , that I found it absolutely impossible to fix this very interesting Business exactly on the Plan resolved on in Conference , tho I have kept up to the Spirit , as near as the Nature & Necessity of the Case would admit of .

		The Difficulty with the Soldiers is as great , indeed more so , if possible , than with the Officers .

		They will not inlist until they know their Col : , Lieut.
Col	PERSON	, Major , Capt. & c so that it was necessary to fix the Officers the first Thing , which is , at last , in some Measure done , & I have given out inlisting Orders .

		You , Sir , can much easier judge , than I can express the Anxiety of Mind I must labour under on this Occasion , especially at this Time , when we may expect the Enemy will begin to act , on the Arrival of their Reinforcement , Part of which is already come , and the Remainder daily dropping in .

		I have other Distresses of a very alarming Nature .

		The Arms of our Soldiery are so exceedingly bad , that I assure you , Sir , I can not place a proper Confidence in them .

		Our Powder is wasting fast , notwithstanding the strictest Care , Oeconomy , & Attention , are paid to it .

		The long Series of wet Weather we have had , renders the greater Part of what has been served out to the Men , of no Use .

		Yesterday I had a Proof of it ; as a Party of the Enemy , about four or five Hundred , taking the Advantage of a high Tide , landed at
Lechmore	ORGANIZATION	's Point , which at that
Time	ORGANIZATION	was in Effect an Island .

		We were alarmed , and of course ordered every Man to examine his Cartouch box , when the melancholy Truth appeared , & we were obliged to furnish the greater Part of them with fresh Ammunition .

		The Damage done at the Point , was the Taking off a Man , who watched a few Horses and Cows ー two of the latter were carried off .

		Col.
-LSB- William -RSB- Thompson	PERSON	marched down with his Regiment of Rifle-men , and was joined by Col.
-LSB- Benjamin Ruggles	PERSON	-RSB-
Woodbridge	PERSON	with a Part of his , and a Part of -LSB-
John -RSB- Patterson	PERSON	's Regiment , who gallantly waded thro ' the Water , and soon obliged the Enemy to embark under Cover of a Man of War , a floating Battery , and the Fire of a Battery on Charles-Town Neck .

		We have two or our Men dangerously wounded by Grape Shot from the Man of War ; and by a Flag out this Day , we are informed the Enemy lossd two of their Men .

Ireland	LOCATION	, 2 & as having any thing to do with Vessels brought in as the North Briton was , will give both you and the General trouble , It is his advice that you will have nothing to do with such by any authority under his Excellency ー By what
Col Glover	PERSON	Informs us , Capt Manly has a claim on this Schooner , in that case you have an undoubted right to take possession of her ; you must be a better judge of this matter being on the spot , than we possibly can .

		If it is clear to you that
Manly	ORGANIZATION	's claim is a just one , it must be prosecuted : If it is not very apparent , dont you Trouble yourself or the General with a Litigious dispute ー I wish you could get rid of the Trouble you must have with the Cargo by the
North Britton	PERSON	.

		Suppose you was to give it Vessel & c up to the Committee of Safety ?

		In Short get rid of the Trouble in the best manner you can , & Let us hear nothing further thereon .

		That the agency for the

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO CAPTAIN
GEORGE VANDEPUT	PERSON	,
R.N. Sir Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	November 11 , 1775 .

		I have received by the Viper your Letter October 18 , with a Letter from Governor
Tryon	PERSON	and Mr -LSB-
David -RSB- Mathews	PERSON	2 inclosed , giving me an Account of your having apprized Captain
Wallace	PERSON	at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	of the Rebels intention of conveying Cloathing and dry Goods through the Sound to
New London	LOCATION	, to supply their
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was a proper Precaution and I hope Captain
Wallace	PERSON	will contrive to prevent their Scheme taking Effect .

		I had the same information from another Quarter , and had also sent it to Captain
Wallace	PERSON	, but it was not so early as yours .

		I very much pity Governor Tryons Situation , and think with you he had better take up his abode on board the
Asia	LOCATION	until he can reside on shore with Security , for the Magistracy of the City however disposed are not in a condition to protect him .

		The Philadelphians will no doubt try every method to prevent the Kings Ships coming to the City .

		I have a description of the Triangles , and of the Boats constructed to guard the River , but I hope to shew them next Spring we can surmount every difficulty to chastize such an ungrateful Set of People .

		The Refusal of the third Regiment to submit to the Orders of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and military Discipline hath an exceeding good Aspect .

		I hope the example will be followed , and then we can not fail of Success .

		I inclose an Order to discharge Bicker , upon the Information you have transmitted , and all things considered I think it would be unjust to detain him any longer , but as to
Ensign Tyley	PERSON	-LSB-
Edward Tilley	PERSON	-RSB- his Recommendation is sufficient to authorize his detention , therefore he shall have a Voyage to
England	LOCATION	.

		What is become of Captain -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Holland	PERSON	and his Officers on the Survey ?

		I observe you mention that his most valuable Draughts are sent home , but he must notwithstanding have many Articles remaining of too great Consequence to fall into the hands of an ignorant , infatuated Mob .

		If you can get a Line to him , let him know that I would not have him put too much Confidence in the
Perth Amboyans	LOCATION	, and desire him to place what he wishes to preserve on board you .

		You have no doubt gained a good deal of information respecting
Hudsons River	LOCATION	, where the Passes are , the distance from each other , when the Navigation is generally open , it 's Depth of Water , how far navigable for Ships and other Vessels , what landing Places are on its Banks , what Number of Vessels are in the River , their Size , how rigged and navigated ?

		I shall be glad to receive what Intelligence you can procure respecting the whole or any part of the aforegoing Queries ; and every necessary information respecting the other Rivers you can get , and shall be obliged to you to purchase for me a good Chart of the River as high up as possible .

		The Phoenix or some other Ship will very soon relieve you , and bring Orders for your proceeding to
England	LOCATION	; therefore collect and commit to writing every intelligence necessary to be given to Captain
Parker	PERSON	, that after his Arrival you may get away without being delayed .

		All your Marines are to be left behind , your Swivel Guns and the Stores belonging to them , Your Moaring Swivel , and every thing that can be useful to the
Phoenix	LOCATION	or smaller Ships , and the
Asia	LOCATION	can spare ; but Captain
Parker	PERSON	on his Arrival will give you particular Orders about these things .

		Remember to send me Copies of such Intelligence as you leave with your Successor ; and as I am resolved upon having the
Phoenix	LOCATION	and Viper this Winter at
New York	LOCATION	, I would have you facilitate this Matter as much as lies in your power before Captain Parkers Arrival , by getting the best Pilots for him , and discovering a Situation least exposed to Danger by Ice , where he can at once fix himself .

R.N. Sir Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	11 Novr 1775 By the Orders and Instructions now sent you will learn that his Majesty is firmly resolved to reduce the Colonies to obedience ; I therefore desire you will steadily and vigorously pursue every means in your power for that purpose .

		Let me know what Sort of Ships you would have , how many more , and in general every thing that you can desire to carry on your Operations against the Rebels ; Endeavour by all means to secure the possession of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	free from Irruptions from the Continent , let no method be left untried .

		The Ports within the Sound must be destroyed if possible , and the Stock on the Islands round you preserved .

		I know this is an arduous task ; but I likewise know that whatever is possible to be done you can effect ; take every opportunity of getting Cattle for us , for our existence this Winter depends on Supplies of fresh Provisions for the People .

		If you can procure Potatoes , Turnips , Carrots , whether by Ravage or Purchase , send them here , I will supply all the Seamen with Roots or Vegetables if they can be had .

		I repeat my Reliance upon your Activity and Zeal for the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	, and I desire if I have omitted to send you any Supplies or Directions that you will point it out to me with any Observations tending to the good of the Service .

		I am & c

		His Ships were kept cruizing under many difficulties in all Weathers , their Commanders received frequent and full directions for their Conduct ; every method was tried to annoy the Enemy and to secure New York &
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, as places of the greatest importance ; Convoys were always ready at the shortest Notice , and every assistance given that was practicable to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, insomuch that no Stratagem was left unessayed to provide the
Garrison	LOCATION	with provisions and fuel for the Winter .

		And here it may not be improper to recall the Readers Observation that all the several Directions given by the Admiral in consequence of the Rebellion until the arrival of the Raven on the 4th of October issued from himself without the least instruction from Administration that he constantly anticipated the Orders of Government by his foresight of Exigencies & that now he ventured at his own peril , & for the sake of the public , to disobey the Admiralty Orders brought by the
Phoenix	LOCATION	. ''

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- Tyonderoga November 11th 1775 .

		Sir I did Myself the Honor to address You on the 7th instant , Since which I have received No Advices from General
Montgomery	PERSON	, I believe he left
St Johns	PERSON	on the sixth with the whole
Army	ORGANIZATION	in Order to attempt
Montreal	LOCATION	, and from what I have been able to learn from the Prisoners , he has the greatest Prospect of reaping Fresh Laurels .

		ー Colo :
Arnold	PERSON	was not arrived at the
St Lawrence	LOCATION	on the 30th Ult. , I am apprehensive that he suffers much from the Length of his March , Unforsoon Difficulties & bad Weather .

		ー We have already had snow here & I fear that the
Earth	LOCATION	in
Canada	LOCATION	, is covered with It , a very trying Situation for an
Army	ORGANIZATION	so very deficient in Clothing as ours is .

		I feel so much for them in their unhappy Situation , destitute of every Necessary to guard against the
Inclemency of the Season	PERSON	, that I have ventured to desire Genl
Montgomery	PERSON	to purchase Clothing for all those who will remain in the
Service	ORGANIZATION	; When I gave this Order I had not forgot that You had conveyed Me the Resolution of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	`` That they would endeavour to attend to the Cloathing of the Troops , -LSB- '' -RSB- but the Necessity was so pressing , that a Delay mig -LSB- ht -RSB- have proved Fatal to Us & which I hope will be a sufficient Excuse for my Presumption .

		ー Inclose You a Return of the Officers that were made Prisoners at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, that of the Men is mislaid but I think they exceed four hundred exclusive of the Canadians .

		ー The 7th & 26th are on their March to
Connecticut	LOCATION	the Canadian Officers wait the Arrival of their
Bagga	PERSON	-LSB- ge -RSB- & I propose sending them to Trentown , I am much at a Loss what to do with the Canadian Privates , they are almost naked & beg hard to return to their Families , I have wrote to General
Montgomery	PERSON	on the Subject , If they are to be kept , there will be a Necessity of Clothing them .

		ー The Officers of the 7th & 26th applied to me for Blankets & Shoes for their Men , who are almost barefooted .

		I have no such Articles here & If I had I should not have thought Myself Justifiable in giving them , as We are in great Want Ourselves ; ー They then asked Money , & I have ventured to give Major
Preston One	PERSON	hundred and seventy two pounds six
Shillings New York Currency	ORGANIZATION	as much to Capt :
Kinnear	PERSON	who commanded the seventh , To Capt :
Godwin	PERSON	of the Artillery forty Pounds six to the Officers with Major
Stopford	PERSON	about Eighty Pounds ; I thought It best that they should supply themselves especially as they consider themselves accountable to me for the Money .

		ー ... And our affairs wear so favorable an Aspect in
Canada	LOCATION	, that if
Colo	PERSON	:
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	should penetrate to
Quebec	LOCATION	, the whole Country will in all Probability be in our Hands soon .

		An Event that will doubtless be attended with the most salutary Consequences to the Colonies provided we can keep our Ground in that Province the ensuing Campaign .

		I shall therefore venture , to descend a little more into Particulars , & to give you my Opinion of What may be necessary in this Quarter ; But I assure you Sir , that I do this with the greatest Diffidence & Defference to the better Judgment of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー Three Thousand Men I conceive would not be too many to remain in
Canada	LOCATION	this Winter One of these at
Quebec	LOCATION	, Another at
Montreal	LOCATION	, five hundred at Trois Reiviers , as being the Principal Places in that Country , the Remaining five hundd at
Chambly & St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, but the Season is so far advanced that Necessity will oblige
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to be content with such Numbers out of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	now there as can be prevailed upon to stay , but why so large a Body of Troops , when Nothing is to dread 'd this Winter ?

		It will confirm the Canadians of the Opinion they begin to entertain of the Strength of the Colonies , an Opinion which should be carefully cultivated , that they may act with Vigour & Spirit next Year against the Attacks which will in all Probability take Place early in the Spring , as the Regular Troops which will then be in
America	LOCATION	, can be easily conveyd to
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		And they ought also to be on the Spot in order to repair the Fortifications -LRB- which I am informed want it much -RRB- as soon as the Winter gives Way .

		The Command in
Canada	LOCATION	should be given to a prudent and active Officer & one that has Talents to conciliate the Affections of that People .

		None More equal to the Task , than the Gentleman who now Commands the
Army	ORGANIZATION	there , if he will remain .

		But as three thousand Men may not be sufficient even with the Aid of the Canadians , on whom it may be prudent not to place too much Dependance , to resist a Vigorous Attack , a Number of Batteaus should be constructed here in Addition to those we have sufficient to convey a large Body of Men into
Canada	LOCATION	when ever it may be found necessary .

		ー I believe one hundred will be sufficient , Every thing should be prepared this Winter for Building these Batteaus , a
Quantity of Provisions & Stores	ORGANIZATION	should be carryed to
Fort George	LOCATION	.

		ー The proper Places for erecting Batteries on the St Lawrence above
Quebec	LOCATION	should be determined on and such Craft constructed as will prevent Armed Vessels from coming up , should the Garrison of Quebec be unable to resist the Force that may be brought against It .


ー Every Military Department	ORGANIZATION	in this Quarter should be put on a proper Footing and widely different from what it is at present , at once to save Expence & that the Service may be carryed on with that Order , the Want of which in this Campaign , the Country will feel in the Extra-Expence and Your Commanders have experienced with Pain , Nor will their Successors have fewer difficulties to encounter U -LSB- nless -RSB- such Regulations are adopted as have a Tendency -LSB- to -RSB- promote good Order , Subordination , Discipline & Oecono -LSB- my , -RSB- For the Bulk of Mankind , whatever their Principles may be , forget to act up to them , when it is most necessary that they should not deviate from them .

		I am Building ten Sleds to be employd At the
Saw Mills	ORGANIZATION	in Drawing Oak Timber for the Bottoms & Garboard Streaks of Batteaus , or in Conveying the Cannon from hence to
Canada	LOCATION	or to
Hudsons River	LOCATION	or in Drawing Fire wood for the Garrisons , the Season is so far advanced , that I could not wait for the
Sanction of Congress &	ORGANIZATION	have therefore sent to
Canada	LOCATION	for twenty Horses , which are much cheaper there than with Us .

		ー At each of the lower Ferries on
Hudson 's River	LOCATION	, above
Albany	LOCATION	there are two Boats , the two Uppermost have only one & they are small & worn out , so that the Detention of the Provisions & Baggage causes not only a very considerable Expence , but retards the Service .

		this Evil might be guarded against by Building four Good Scows like those on Schuyl-Kill -LSB- River -RSB- & have them managed by Soldiers picked for that Purpose , and I believe the Expence will hardly exceed that of the Ferriage we now Pay , should
Congress	ORGANIZATION	approve of Building these , they will please to order two Shipwrights up , who know the Construction , the soonest possible that the Timber may be procured & the Boats if possible built in the Winter .

		the 11th .

		-LSB- 1775 -RSB- Col.
Woodford	PERSON	offered to go and take the Command of all the Forces which were there -LSB-
Hampton	PERSON	-RSB- or might be called in .

		With the Assistance of waggon Horses and rnch as were lent by the Gentlemen of the Town the Col. , Captn .


Bluford	PERSON	-LSB-
Abraham Buford	PERSON	-RSB- and his
Rifle Company	ORGANIZATION	were enabled to reach
Hampton	PERSON	about 7 O'Clock A.M. -LSB- October 27 . -RSB-

		They rode through an incessant and heavy Rain .

		When the Col. entered the Town , having left the Rifle Men in the Church to dry themselves he rode down to the River took A view of the Town , and then seeing the Six Tenders at Anchor in the
River	LOCATION	went to Col.
Cary	PERSON	's to dry himself and eat his Breakfast .

		But before he could do either the Tenders had cut their Way through the Vessel 's Boltsprit which was sunk to impede their Passage and having a very fresh and fair
Gale	PERSON	had anchored in the
Creek	LOCATION	and abreast of the Town .

		The People were so astonished at their unexpe -LSB- cted -RSB- and sudden Arrival that they stood staring at them and omitt -LSB- ed -RSB- to give the Col. the least Notice of their approach .

		The first Intelligence he had of this Affair was from the Discharge of a 4 Pounder .

		He mounted his Horse and riding down to the Warf found that the Peop -LSB- le -RSB- of the Town had abandoned their Houses andthe
Militia	ORGANIZATION	had left the Breast Work which had been thrown up across the Wharf and Street .

		He returned to order down Captn .


Nicholas	PERSON	's Company and
Bluford	PERSON	's and meeting
Nicholas	PERSON	's , which had been encamped near Col. Car -LSB- y 's -RSB- he lead them pulling down the Garden Pails through
Jones	PERSON	's Garden under Cover of his
House	ORGANIZATION	, and lodged them in the
House	ORGANIZATION	directing them to fire from the Window which they did with great Spirit .

		He then returned and lead
Bluford	PERSON	's Company in the same manner under Cover of Houses on the other Side of the Street placing some in a
House	ORGANIZATION	and others at a Breast
Wark	PERSON	on the Shore .

		Here he found the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	had crowded in , and incommoded the Rifle me -LSB- n -RSB- He therefore ordered them off and stationed them with Captn .


Lynes	PERSON	on the back of the Town to prevent a surprise , by an Attack of Regulars who it was said had landed at Back water .

		Captn .


Barron	PERSON	with the Town Militia and Part of
Nicholas	PERSON	's Company were stationed at the Breast Work on the Wharf and across the Street .

		The Fire was now general and constant on both Sides .

		Cannon Balls Grape Shot and Musket Balls whistled over the Heads of our Men , Whilst our Muskets and Rifles poured Showers of Balls into .

		their Vessels and they were so well directed that the
Men on Board the Schooner	ORGANIZATION	in which Captn .


Squires	PERSON	himself commanded , were unable to stand to their 4 Pounders which were not sheltered by a Netting , and gave but one Round of them but kept up an incessant firing of smaller Guns and swivels , as did 2 Sloops and 3 Boats for more than an Hour and 1/4 , when they slipt their Cables and towed out except the Hawk Tender a Pilot Boat they had taken some
Time	ORGANIZATION	before from a Man of
Hampton	LOCATION	, which was taken .

		In her they found 3 wounded Men 6 Sailors and 2
Negros	LOCATION	.

		Liutent .


Wright	PERSON	who commanded her had been forced to jump over Board and was attended to the Shore by 2
Negros	ORGANIZATION	and a white Man , one of the
Negros	LOCATION	was shot by a Rifle Man across the
Creek	LOCATION	at 400 yds .

		distance .

		If Col.
Woodford	PERSON	's Men whom he had ordered rou -LSB- nd -RSB- to the Creeks Mouth could have got there soon enough they would undoubtedly have taken the little
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, for the Sailors could not possibly have towed them through their Fire .

		Although the nearest of the Tenders was 3 Hundred Yds .

		and the farthest about 450 from our Me -LSB- n , -RSB- yet our Fire was -LSB- so -RSB- well directed that the Sailor -LSB- s -RSB- were not able to stand to their Guns and serve them pr -LSB- operly -RSB- but fir -LSB- ed -RSB- them at Random at an Unaccountable Degree of Elevation .

		The same
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	came up Jas .

		River some Days after -LSB- November 1 -RSB- and attempted to land at Jas .

		Town but were prevented by about -LSB- -RSB- Rifle men and as many Country People who happened to be there .

		A few Rifle Balls con -LSB- ... -RSB- the 34 Four Pounders with Which our Ea -LSB- rs -RSB- were saluted .

		Our Men brought up a 4 lb -LSB- Ball . -RSB-

		And yesterday the King
Fisher	PERSON	and 3 Large Tenders - -LRB- which had come up to B -- s -LSB-
Burwell	PERSON	's -RSB- Ferry to prevent the Passage of our 2d .

		Regiment and the Culpep -LSB- er -RSB- Batalion which were ordered down to Norfo -LSB- lk -RSB- fired on a Vessel at the Ferry Landing order -LSB- ing -RSB- her to come along side , but our Rifle men stationed there ordered the Skipper to stay where he was .

		The Vessel lay about 3 Hundred Yds .

		from our Men and about 3/4 Mile from the Man of War , which began to fire on her , and finding that her Shot had no Effect sent off a Barge full of Men to take her , but as soon as the Barge had got within a small Distance of the Vessel the Riflemen fired and say they killed three Men .

		However it be , the Barge put back and then made a 2d Attempt which was defeated in the same Manner except that the Rifle -LSB- men -RSB- say they killed but one man the 2d .

		Time .

		The Man of War fired many 6 Pounders at our Men however but 2 of them struck near them .

		One went through a
Stone House	ORGANIZATION	and the other lodged in the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	over the Heads of our Men which they dug out and sent by Captn .

		Green to Col.
Henry	PERSON	.

		I can assure you that about 20 Rifle Men have disputed witp the Man of War and her Tenders fbr this Vessel 2 Days and they have hitherto kept her and the Ferry Boats safe , which it is supposed they wish to burn .

		It is incredible how much they dread a Rifle .

		Before the Man of War had come up the River , 250 of our Men had crossed over with their Baggage .

		The Remainder are to join them as soon as possible either by venturing over before the Enemies -LSB- Faces ? -RSB-

		or by passing over higher up .

		The People at
Norfolk	LOCATION	are under dreadful Apprehensions of having their Town burnt by this Detachment .

		They know they deserve it , but we seem to be at a Loss what to do with them .

		Many of them deserve to be ruined and hanged but others again have acted dastardly for Want of Protection .

		But at all Events rather than the .

		Town should be garrisoned by our Enemies and a Trade opened for all the Scoundrels in the Country , we must be prepared to destroy it .

		If we had but Salt enough to satisfy our Country Men who begin to complain for want of it , and Arms and Ammunition , we should be able to make a very good Stand against all the Forces that can be sent to
Virginia	LOCATION	, for I can assure you notwithstanding the Affair of
Norfolk	LOCATION	and
Kemps Landing	LOCATION	, Your Country Men are brave and hearty in the Cause .


John Page	PERSON	P.S. I have just seen the K -- s Proclamation .

		I forgot to mention that Yesterday a Man came to the Camp and said that Captn .


Montag	PERSON	-LSB- u -RSB- desired to speak with one of our Officers , and sa -LSB- id -RSB- he would come ashore , or receive our Officer on Board .

		Upon this Col.
Bullet	PERSON	was permitted by Col. H -- y to go down to the River and enquire into this Matter .

		The Co -LSB- l. -RSB- dressed himself in Red , rode down to the Sh -LSB- ore -RSB- -RRB- at a Distance from every Person , bowed to the Ship and waved his Hat , but they immediately run out all their Guns primed them and discharged one at him .

		The Col. however paraded it for some ti -LSB- me -RSB- to shew he was not afraid and then came ba -LSB- ck -RSB- satisfied that he had been misinformed or that it was intended as an insult altogether .

VIRGINIA	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY TO THE
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	DELEGATES IN THE
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	CONGRESS Gentlemen Williamsbg Novr 11 .

		1775 The
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	have received & considered yr Favr of Octr 31st & can easily Foresee the necessity of Arms & Amunition being sought for during this Winter , and the proprietie of relaxing so much of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	as might interfere with the prosecution of that business ; we also wish you to consider whether the importation of Salt , might not be included in that regulation , as we are informed From all parts that the Clamours of the people begin to be high on Accot of that Article , and we greatly Fear the consequences if some method can not be fallen on to Supply their wants ー we are sorry to say we hear nothing promising From Mr
Tate	PERSON	, and are told
Ld Dunmore	ORGANIZATION	has already collected a large quantity & is embracing every Opportunity , by seising what comes in his way , of increasing his store , we doubt not with an intention to test the Virtue of our people , when the want of that necessary Article , becomes more sensible among them .

		Tho ' we se -LSB- e -RSB- the Utility of the measurs adopted by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	For the importation of these necessaries , we at the same time ー can not avoid contemplating the danger & almost insuperable difficulties , which in Our Opinion will attend the carrying it into Execution here , in our defenceless State without a single Armed Vessell to give the exports & imports even the Shadow -LSB- of -RSB- Protection ー this circumstance , with the bad prospect we have of the Former experiment in the
Bills of Exchange	ORGANIZATION	, induces Us not to take upon Ourselves the adoption & Execution of this proposition , but to submit it to a Convention which is to meet the first day of December , And the determination shall be communicated to you if your continuing to sit in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	shall prevent our having the pleasure of yr .

		Assistance .

		Our best Accounts make the
Force of Ld Dunmore & the Navy	ORGANIZATION	to be this .

		The
Otter & Mercury	ORGANIZATION	20 guns & 170 men each ; in this number however are included those which man Occasionaly the Following tenders Vizt 4 Schooners , one of them formerly belongg to Mr
Saml Griffin	PERSON	& seised at
Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	3 Sloops 3 Pilot Boats .

		On board these Tenders are some 4 & 3 pounders , besides Swivels The
William	PERSON	14 Guns ー we do n't know the number of men but believe those and the Land Forces intrenched at
Gosport	LOCATION	, amount to about 300 .

		The Eilbeck , a new ship pearced for 22 guns not quite fitted A Brigg just arrived from New-York wth 500 stand of Arms , her Force not known .

		The
Number of Torys	ORGANIZATION	at
Norfolk	LOCATION	ca n't be ascertained , as they are mixed with our Freinds , who do not choose to declare until Our Army is there to protect them .

		Nor can we fix the Number of slaves with Ld Dunmore & the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, some Accots make them about 100 Others less Besides these Vessells , we have Frequent Accounts of their seising all that pass , we are told they are going to set up an
Admiralty Court	ORGANIZATION	at
Norfolk	LOCATION	For their condemnation , -LRB- by whom we are not informed -RRB- and Suppose they will be inlisted in the Piratical service .

		We are collecting as desired by the
Committee of Congress	ORGANIZATION	an Account of the several depredations committed here & shall forward it , as soon as we are enabled to do so .

		the only persons we know at present to be detained by them -LRB- besides slaves -RRB- are Mr -LSB-
John -RSB- Goodrich	PERSON	, who brought in the powder , Capt -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Matthews	PERSON	& Mr -LSB-
William -RSB- Robinson	PERSON	, From Princess
Anne	PERSON	.

		We Sympathise with you in the disagreeable Feelings you must sustain On the disgraceful patience & Suffering of some of our people , which tho ' confined to a very few will be charged to the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		The only Appology For them is the exposed Situation of their Families & property , the want of Arms & Amunition & their intermixture with Torys , who instead of Assisting were ready every moment to betray them .

		We could not protect them We had men enough , but , were left to ransack every corner of the Countrey For Arms , tents & other necessarys .

		The few we collected were unavoidably retained here For the protection of our
Magazine Treasury & Records	ORGANIZATION	; both Regiments are now tolerably Armed & Our Troops are marching to
Norfolk	LOCATION	ー let Us have Credit For driving them off at
Hampton	LOCATION	, & For having ever since prevented their coming near the Shore there & up the -LSB-
James -RSB- River	LOCATION	as high as
James Town	PERSON	, tho ' they attempt to frighten Us with ab -LSB- surd -RSB- discharges of their Cannon Pray may we not be favd with such proceedings of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as are compleat & we are to conform to ?

		What is become of the Confederation ?

		We are told some Copies are in the Colony & condemned , whilst we can say nothing on the Subject , being Strangers to its contents .

WILLIAM WHIPPLE	PERSON	TO
JOHN LANGDON	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Portsmouth	LOCATION	12 Nov. 1775 Dear Sir As I never keep copies of familiar Letters , its probable I may sometimes repeat what I may have given you in the preceding one , if that shod be the case I flatter myself your candour will forgive such an error , without any further apology I shall proceed to give some account of matters here ; we have an exceeding Good Battery on
Peirces Island	LOCATION	mounting three 32 pounders one 24 one 18 six 6s four 4s well provided with all necessary implements , on Seavy we have only one 24 six 4s , & 6s the work on the Batteries are well executed , and were nearly finished when we were alarmed with the news from
Falmouth	LOCATION	of the destruction of that place some account of which you have had in the Papers , but least you should not have had the particulars of that cursed piece of barbarity , I 'll give it you here by way of digression , as I had it from a Gentn who left that Town two days after that act of Cruelty .

		The pirates arrived in the harbor on Monday afternoon -LSB- October 16 -RSB- but lay some distance below the Town .

		on Tuesday P.M. they got under sail and came before and as near as they can lay to the Town and sent a Boat ashore with that pretty piece of Composition published in the
Essex Gazette	ORGANIZATION	with the signature of
H Mowet	PERSON	, on the receipt of which a committee of three gentlemen , who had been particularly kind to the Barbarian who commanded went on board in hope that their influence might prevail so far as to have the distruction of the
Town	ORGANIZATION	delayed 'till they might have time to move their women & children & effects out , but their efforts were to little purpose , indeed the savage made them this generous offer , that if they would deliver up all their arms & ammunition , & swear allegience -LRB- I do n't know to who but suppose it must be to the Devil as it is evident they must act under the influence of his Infernal Majesty -RRB- send on board four of the principal gentlemen as hostages , he would delay the destruction of the Town 'till he could hear from the Admiral , on the whole , the best terms they could obtain ; was if they would deliver up part of their arms he wod suspend the execution of his infernal orders 'till 9 o'clock , next morning , they being intirely defenceless ; not one cannon fit for use & very short of powder for their small arms comply 'd so far as to send him eight Muskets .

		At the time set next morning the agents of Hell began their work and kept a constant fire 'till evening .

		About 3/4 ths of the Buildings were destroyed and about half the effects , the news reached us about 8 o'clock on Thursday morning , & that Mowatts orders were to come here next .

		This alarmed many people so that they set about moving out of Town , expresses were immediately dispatch 'd to all parts of the country to call in assistance the summons was readily obeyed ; people flocked in from all quarters , & in a few days were in such a situation as to wish the approach of the enemy , that we might have it in our power to revenge the abuse of our Brethren of
Falmouth	LOCATION	.

		We also sent a messenger to General
Washington	LOCATION	telling him our situation and begging a little powder as we had only 17 lbs but none could be obtained .

		I am certain it gave the General great pain that it was not in his power to assist us , however , we were tolerable easy with what we had as the crookedness of the river and strength of the tide is a great security to us , the flouer ship is sunk in crooked
Lane	PERSON	to stop up that passage .

		A boom placed obliquely across the River from
Henderson Point	LOCATION	to
Peirce 's Island	LOCATION	, four vessels moored just above the boom to set fire to if there should be occasion twenty pr fire rafts ready to burn off whenever called for ; this is our scituation at present , there has been 1000 men in pay ever since the alarm -LRB- about a fortnight :[ -RRB- -RSB- The -LSB- Provincial -RSB- congress voted yesterday eight companies of 100 men each , exclusive of 200 montrosses before ordered to be enlisted , for two months the Expenses attending these preparations are immense for this poor colony , but I hope the benevolence of the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	will consider us on some future day , at present it seems to me to be the determination of every one to risque his all in support of his liberties & priviliges , the unheard of cruelties of the enemy have so effectually united us that I believe there are not four persons now in portsmouth who do not justify the measures persuing in opposition to the Tyranny of
Great Britain	LOCATION	ー the men of war arc frequently cruzing of -LSB- f -RSB- in the
Bay	LOCATION	, but dare not or at least do not venture in , about a week ago a frigate 2 anchored between
Bass Rock & Odiornes	ORGANIZATION	point ; when she first appeard it was thought she was coming into the
Harbor	LOCATION	but she disapointed us by going off early next morning .

		About 250 men are stationed on New Castle ; the inhabitants have all left that place There is a Battery of six guns on
Kittery	LOCATION	point .

		12 pounders is the heaviest mettle there .

		I am very sorry they are not better provided ; however on the whole our harbor is in such a state that if the Enemy shod think proper to make us a visit we should give them a warm reception 3 1 .

		Whether Genl .

		How -LSB- e -RSB- after receiving such a Reinforcement will remain quiet in his Quarters , is a matter to be determined ; on thursday last -LSB- November 9 -RSB- about four or five hundred of them taking advantage of a very high Tide , landed at a place called

Falmouth	LOCATION	, and the Inclination which has been shewn of bestowing the same favour on other Towns -LRB- which , by being prepared for their reception , have averted the blow -RRB- is evident proof of the diabolical designs of Administration to prosecute , with unrelenting Fury , the most cruel , and Savage War that ever a Civilized Nation engaged in as it also is , of the necessity of adopting every means which can be devis 'd for the preservation of property ; this led me to hint to your part of the Country through
Lund Washington	LOCATION	, the expediency of stopping the Navigation of the
Potomack	LOCATION	without loss of time ; conceiving that at an Expence , not amounting to one tenth of the damage which the Estates on the
River	LOCATION	may sustain in the course of next Summer , such obstruction 's may be laid as to prevent any Armed Vessel from passing .

		I do not pretend to point out the place where or precise manner how , this is to be effected .

		In
Delaware	LOCATION	they have attempted it by sinking of
Chevaux	LOCATION	, de Frieze , and Row Gallies .

		In
Potomack	LOCATION	I think it might be done by
Chevaux de Frieze	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- or sinking of vessels -RRB- and Batteries on one , or both sides of the River as Circumstances might require .

		I have often heard , that some where below
Quantico	LOCATION	the Channel was so narrow as to -LSB- -RSB- so , and the Land adjoining is proper , what -LSB- -RSB- the attempt ?

		Highland is the -LSB- -RSB- these kinds of Batteries ; because -LSB- -RSB- from thence -LSB- -RSB- at the same time -LSB- -RSB- it -LSB- -RSB- receive no kind of Injury ; where Batteries upon a Level are -LSB- -RSB- Silenced .

		Guns dismounted by the ships .

		If such a Situation -LSB- -RSB-
Colo.	LOCATION	.


Fairfax	LOCATION	could be found -LSB- -RSB- it would be impassible ; because -LSB- -RSB- 3 Vessel is Raked from Stern to Stern from the time she gets within reach -RRB- of your Guns , till she is directly under them ; and from Stem to
Stern	PERSON	till she is out of reach of them , after passing ; and this without bringing more than one or two guns to bear on you , without heaving too which would protract her passage .

		I mention this matter , because I am very willing to have my property taxed to its proportionate amount to effect a Plan of defence to it .

JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- Extract -RSB- No Carolina Cruizer Sloop of War in Cape Fear River November 12th 1775 .

		My Lord I have the honor to inform Your Lordship that I received on the 28th day of last month from the
Post House	ORGANIZATION	in
Wilmington	LOCATION	a Packet from
Your Lordship 's Office	ORGANIZATION	, bearing the most palpable evidence of violation and no Post mark whatever , but -LRB-
Hampton	PERSON	25/6 -RRB- written on the upper corner of the cover .

		This being the name of the first town within the Capes of
Virginia	LOCATION	, I am led to conclude , that the Packet I have received is part of what Your Lordship taught me to expect by Your last dispatches by a store Ship that was about to sail for that Province , which being there put on shore has fallen into the hands of the Committees who have transferred it from one to the other after purloining it of what they have thought meet , until it has been finally deposited in the
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	at
Wilmington	LOCATION	, as it carries no marks of the intermediate Post Offices at
Norfolk Suffolk Edenton	LOCATION	and
New Bern	LOCATION	.

		I shall use my utmost endeavours to discover by what means and through what channel this Packet came to the
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	at
Wilmington	LOCATION	, and if I am able to ascertain that point , of which I own I have no great hopes , it may be possible to trace back its whole progress to the first violation .

		I flattered myself that my representations to Your Lordship of the violences which had been done by
Congresses	ORGANIZATION	and Committees throughout this Continent would have arrived timely to prevent Your Lordship trusting Your Dispatches to any other conveyances than the Packets to
South Carolina	LOCATION	the ordinary Channels of Your Lordship 's correspondance , -LRB- whose letters for me are lodged by my directtion , on board The King 's Ship there -RRB- or by his Majesty 's Ships bound thither , or to this Port .

		The Scorpion Sloop of War arrived here yesterday from
Boston	LOCATION	, 2 and brought me letters of old date from General
Gage	PERSON	discouraging my expectations of any aids from him .

		This Ship is come to relieve the Cruizer Sloop which is certainly in too bad condition to proceed to
Boston	LOCATION	at this Season of the year , and is necessary as well as The Scorpion , and may be usefully employed here to guard against the introduction of wilitary Stores that I learn are very deficient among the Rebels here who are in constant expectation of Supplies by Vessels which have been sent for them .

		these circumstances I have represented to Captain
Thornborough	PERSON	at
Charles Town	LOCATION	, who is the Commanding Officer of The
King	ORGANIZATION	's Ships in the Southern Provinces at present , and I hope he will order things accordingly .

		I have also advised that a
Transport	ORGANIZATION	, which General
Gage	PERSON	has sent here under Convoy of The Scorpion , to remove the Artillery from
Fort Johnston	LOCATION	, should remain here 'til the Spring , after receiving those Stores on board , as her return to
Boston	LOCATION	at this time of the year , will be very hazardous , and uncertain .

		That having yesterday , about two o'clock in the afternoon , proceeded with four hulks , in order to sink them upon the bar of that creek , being about gunshot from the King 's ships Tamer of 16 , and Cherokee of 6 guns ー as he approached the place of his destination , the
Tamer	PERSON	fired six shots at him , which he , just coming to an anchor , returned with two ; that the

		That however , as the hulk , being loaded with sand , was a considerable time in sinking ; and as he was considerably retreated , the Tamer sent an armed boat , which fired the hulk , towing her into shallower water , where she shortly after sunk .

		That , in his retreat , he ineffectually fired a shot at this armed boat , but finding his shot would not be of any service , he refrained from such an expenditure of ammunition .

		That notwithstanding so long and severe a cannonade from the Tamer and Cherokee , he received no other damage , but one shot under his counter , one in his broadside , and a third which cut his fore starbard shroud .

WILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON	PERSON	TO THE
GEORGIA	LOCATION	COUNCIL OF SAFETY , SAVANNAH By Order of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Gentlemen ,
South-Carolina	PERSON	,
Charles-Town	PERSON	, November 12 , 1775 .

		The actual commencement of hostilities by the British arms in this colony against the inhabitants , is an event of the highest moment to the southern part of the
United Colonies	LOCATION	on this continent : therefore , lest so important an event should be misrepresented , I am directed to inform you of the particulars of it , and of a subsequent action .

		As it was found necessary to obstruct the channel of
Hog-Island	LOCATION	creek , being one approach to this town from
Rebellion-Road	LOCATION	,
Capt. Tufts	LOCATION	, commander of the colony scooner Defence , mounted with two nine-pounders , six six-pounders , and two four-pounders , having on board seventy seamen and marines , proceeded yesterday , about two in the afternoon , with four hulks , in order to sink them upon the bar of that creek , being about gunshot from the King 's ships Tamer of sixteen , and the Cherokee of six guns .

		ー As Captain
Tufts	PERSON	approached the place of his destination , the
Tamer	PERSON	fired six shot at him , which Capt.
Tufts	ORGANIZATION	, just coming to an anchor , returned with two ; and the Tamer continuing the cannonade , Capt.
Tufts	ORGANIZATION	contented himself with returning only one shot more , and then proceeded to sink the hulks .

		He accordingly sank three large scooner hulks , but the fourth not coming up early enough on the tide , he continued the night on his station in order to sink her also , at a proper time of tide .

		About a quarter after four in the morning , the
Tamer	LOCATION	and
Cherokee	LOCATION	, having warped nearer to Capt.
Tufts	ORGANIZATION	in the night , discharged their broadsides at him , and continued the cannonade until about seven o'clock , when Capt.
Tufts	ORGANIZATION	, having notwithstanding so heavy a fire , carried the hulk to her proper station , and having scuttled her in various places , left her sinking , and then , having no further duty to perform , he retreated .

		However , as the hulk being loaded with sand , was a considerable time in sinking , and as Capt.
Tufts	ORGANIZATION	was considerably retreated , the Tamer sent an armed boat which fired the hulk , towing her into shallower water , where she shortly after sank .

		Capt.
Tufts	PERSON	in his retreat , ineffectually fired a shot at this armed boat , but finding his firing would not be of any service , he very prudently refrained from such an expenditure of ammuntion .

		Notwithstanding so long and severe a cannonade from the Tamer and
Cherokee	LOCATION	, on board of which last Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	has for some time past fixed his residence , Capt.
Tufts	ORGANIZATION	received no other damage , but one shot under his counter , one in his broadside , and a third which cut his fore starboard shroud , not a man was wounded .

		In general the shot passed between his rigging and struck the main land ; and amidst this imminent danger , the officers and men on board , although in general new in the service , displayed the greatest chearfulness , tranquility and coolness during this heavy fire .

		Fort
Johnson	PERSON	discharged some twenty-six pounders at the Tamer and Cherokee , but the cannon requiring an elevation of ten degrees to reach them , rather than continue to discharge such random shot , the firing from that post was discontinued .

		The inhabitants of this metropolis were in general spectators of the latter part of the cannonade .

		The drums beat to arms , and the militia in a body assembled under their officers , with such alertness , and so properly armed , as gave the highest pleasure and confidence to the public .

		My dear General , The Badness of the Weather & worse Roads have put it out of my Power to get here before Yesterday ー A favorable Wind the Night before enabled Mr
Carleton	PERSON	to get away with his little
Garrison on Board	ORGANIZATION	ten or eleven little Vessels reserved for that Purpose & to carry away the Powder & other important Stores .

		ー I do n't despair of getting hold of the Powder yet ー No Diligence shall be wanting for that Purpose ー By Intercepted Letters I find
Colo	PERSON	:
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	is certainly arrived in the Neighberhood of
Quebec	LOCATION	, that the King 's Friends are exceedingly alarmed & expect to be beseiged .

		ー Which with the Blessing of God they shall be if the severe Season holds off & I can prevail on the Troops to accompany me ー The Lizard Man of War is arrived there she has brought # 20,000 Sterling & 100 Marines They have had some other little Reinforcements of Recruits for
McClean	PERSON	's Regiment & Artificers to the Amount in all of including Marines & Sailors -LSB- of -RSB- 450 Men ー one of the Brigs is arrived with Cloathing & Arms for the faithful Canadians as Mr
Carleton	PERSON	with Propriety terms them .

		ー This Morning we have taken Possession of the Town I send You their Articles of Capitulation with my Answer & hope It may meet with Approbation .

		ー I ca n't help feeling great Uneasiness till I know the Determination of the Troops with respect to engaging for six Months longer ー I was obliged at
St Johns	LOCATION	to promise all such their Dismission as chose it , to coax them to
Montreal	LOCATION	Indeed
Wooster	PERSON	's Regiment shewed the greatest Uneasiness .

		I make no Doubt of retaining as Many as will hold the Ground already gotten ー but it is of the utmost Importance to finish this Business at once that the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	may have no Hopes left of carrying on their infernal Plan -LSB- s -RSB- in this important Quarter ー At any Rate it will be highly expedient to throw in a large Body of Troops as soon as the Ice will bear in order to make a Vigorous Attack on
Quebec	LOCATION	before the arrival of Succours in the Spring should It not fall into our Hands this Winter ー but should this Instance of good Fortune crown our Labours , some Advantageous Post must be chosen below
Quebec	LOCATION	, where a large
Corps of Troops	ORGANIZATION	strongly posted , a Boom over a Narrow Channel & floating Batteries may baffle all Attempts from
Europe	LOCATION	, I am told a difficult pass , termed the Traverse will Answer this Purpose , if your Health will not permit You to engage in this Affair .

		ー I think -LSB-
Charles -RSB- Lee	PERSON	ought by all Means to have the Command here .

		I send some Choice Letters of that Worthy & steady Freind to the Colonies ,
Brook Watson	PERSON	, whose Zeal is only to be equalled by his Sincerity ー You will think them of Importance enough I believe to be communicated to
General Washington & the Congress	ORGANIZATION	, Your Freind Mr
William Smith	PERSON	has been pretty well humbugged by this Gentleman .

		I am exceedingly sorry
Congress	ORGANIZATION	have not favored me with a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	ー It would have had a great Effect with the Troops , who are exceedingly turbulent & indeed Mutinous .

		ー My Vexation & Distress can only be alleviated by reflecting on the great Public Advantages which must arise from my unparallel 'd good Fortune .

		ー I shall clothe the Troops compleatly who engage again .

		I find with Pleasure that my Politicks have squared with the Views of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, & shall loose no Time in calling a Convention , when my intended Expedition is finished .

		ー Will not Your Health permit You to reside at
Montreal	LOCATION	this Winter ?

		I must go home If I walk by the
Side of the Lake	LOCATION	, this Winter , I am weary of Power & totally want that Patience & Temper , so requisite for such a Command .

		ー I will take it as a Favor , If You will send
Henry Livingston	PERSON	with Your Dispatches for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー I wish some Method could be fallen upon of engaging Gentlemen to serve , a Point of Honour & more Knowledge of the World to be found in that Class of Men , would greatly reform Discipline & render the Troops much more tractable .

		The Officers of the
1st Regiment of Yorkers & Artillery Company	ORGANIZATION	were very near a Mutiny the Other Day , Because I would not stop the Clothing of the Garrison of
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー I would not have sullied my own Reputation Nor disgraced the Continental Arms by such a Breach of Capitulation , for the Universe ー there was no driving It into their Noddles , that the Clothing was really the Property of the Soldier , that he had paid for It & that Every Regiment -LRB- in this Country especially -RRB- saved a Years Clothing to have decent Clothes to wear on particular Occasions .

		The affair of the ships taken at

Tho ' probably the Continent will be well supplied with Powder in the Spring , yet it is best by all means to put it out of the power of our enemies to Defeat us of that necessary article , by supplying ourselves , and if we have a double or Treble Quantity it will be no Damage , and in future save our Cash from being sent abroad after it .

Philadelphia	LOCATION	Novemr 13th 1775 After Lord

PURDIE	PERSON	'S
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	GAZETTE , FRIDAY , NOVEMBER 17 , 1775
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, Monday , Nov. 13 .

		The tenders which came up to
Jamestown	LOCATION	the week before last , being hindered by our riflemen from burning the ferryboats at that place , went down the river , and in the night destroyed the boats at Mulberry island , and at
Hardy	ORGANIZATION	's , on the opposite shore ; where there was no notice of their arrival , and consequently no opposition .

		And last Thursday -LSB- November 9 -RSB- , a large schooner , and two sloops , carrying small cannon and swivels , sailed up to
Burrell	PERSON	's ferry , under convoy of the
Kingfisher	ORGANIZATION	, capt.
Montague	PERSON	; and coming to , in line of battle , abreast of the ferry-house , warehouse , and boats , hailed a small boat which lay at anchor about 300 yards from the shore , ordering her alongside of the man of war ; but ten riflemen , who happened to be stationed near this place , marching up to the bank , as near as they could get to the boat , ordered the skipper to stay where he was .

		Upon this the man of war fired at the boat , to enforce her orders , which so frightened the skipper that he would willingly have obeyed ; but the riflemen also firing , their superiour metal prevailed .

		The man of war then sent off a barge to bring her off , which , as soon as within reach of our rifles , was so warmly saluted that she thought proper to row back with precipitation , having lost , as was thought , from their falling down , three men ; upon which a smart cannonade ensued , but luckily did no other execution than sending a six pound ball through both sides of the warehouse , very near to some of our men , and several struck and buried in the bank under them .

		Soon after , the man of war made a second attempt to take the boat ; but the rifle guard having received a reinforcement of ten men , it proved as ineffectual as the first , for the barge , on receiving a smart fire , was immediately called back to the ship .

		Thus , by the bravery of a mere handful of men , the ferry-boats have been preserved from destruction ; and the boat in dispute still remains where it was , and where our people ordered it should stay .

		These 20 brave fellows declare they want no assistance if even all the men on board the ship and tenders should attempt to land , provided they come on shore fairly before them , and not land at several places , too far above and below them at once .

JAMES WARREN	PERSON	TO
JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Watertown	LOCATION	, November 14th 1775 ... great Numbers of the Whalemen are gone on Voyages which we permitted after haveing taken Bonds for the Landing their Oil & Bone in some
Port	LOCATION	here other than
Boston	LOCATION	, &
Nantucket	LOCATION	.

		Some of them are in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, &
Sea Coast Service	ORGANIZATION	many of them , & the greater part of our Fishermen & Seamen at Home & in no Service Earnestly wishing to be Employed in the Privateering Business .

		what Numbers might be Inlisted on that Service I cant readily Compute , but I have no difficulty in supposeing that at least three Battalions might be raised in this Colony .

		the taste for it runs high here .

		As to ships & other vessels , I believe there are great Numbers very suitable to Arm Already on hand .

		Almost every Port of any Consequence could furnish more or less , either great or small .

		perhaps Ships might be difficult to find that could mount 20 Guns or Upwards , but Vessels to Carry from 6 .

		to 16 Guns I think we abound in , & I think they would soon furnish us with others .

		these Vessels are of all Burthens , drafts of water , & dimensions & are many of them Excellent Sailors , & may be either purchased , or hired , on very reasonable Terms .

		I think the General gives only 5/4 .

		p Ton p Month .

		I am not Acquainted at
Haverhill Newberry & c.	ORGANIZATION	but from what I have heard Vessels might be Built there , safe & with great dispatch , and perhaps at
Kennebeck	PERSON	and No River & c & c. we have no want of the best Shipwrights .

		as to the Time for Compleating them , much will depend on the winter but they may be ready as soon as wanted in the Spring if Immediately engaged in .

		As for your Next Question , the Names , & c. of those fit to
Command	ORGANIZATION	, I am not quite so ready to answer You know we have not practised Privateering so much here as they have in some of the other Colonies & it is A Business I never was Concerned in , but I have no doubt that many fine Fellows can be found , who have been Masters of Vessels & at some time in their Lives served on
Board Men of War & Privateers	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have one Capt
Sam	PERSON	-LSB- p -RSB- son -LSB-
Simeon Sampson	PERSON	-RSB- in my employ who has serv 'd in both , & perticularly with Capt -LSB-
John -RSB- Mcpherson	PERSON	the last War .

		him I. would venture A Vessel with .

		there is -LSB-
Daniel -RSB- Souter	PERSON	who you know .

		Time wont premit me to recollect many others , but from the Nature & Circumstances of this Colony there must be many .

		I will Endveavour to recollect some for my Next .

		I am glad to see the Policy of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	turned this way , & to see you Engaged you must know I think you qualified for any thing you will undertake .

JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	TO MAJOR
JOSEPH	PERSON	WARD Sir ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, Nov ' r 14 , 1775 I had yesterday the pleasure of your letter of the 4th inst .

		by Captain -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB- Price , for which , as well as the former kind letter , I heartily thank you .

		The report you mention that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	have resolved upon a free trade , is so far from being true that you must have seen by the public papers before now that they have resolved to stop all trade until next March .

		What will be done then time will discover .

		This winter I hope will be improved in preparing some kind of defence for trade .

		ー I hope the Colonies will do this separately .

		ー But these subjects are too important and intricate to be discussed in a narrow compass , and too delicate to be committed to a private letter .

		The report that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has resolved to have no more connections , & c. untill they shall be indemnified , for the damage done by the tyranny of our enemies , will not be true perhaps so soon as some expect it .

		Verbal resolutions accomplish nothing .

		It is to no purpose to declare what we will or will not do in future times .

		Let reasoning Man infer what we shall do from what we actually do .

		The late conduct , in burning towns , so disgraceful to the English name and character , would justify anything , but similar barbarity .

		Let us preserve our temper , our wisdom , our humanity and civility , though our enemies are every day renouncing theirs .

		ー But let us omit nothing necessary for the security of our cause .

		You are anxious for
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	.

		So are we , and for
Montgomery	PERSON	too , untill this day , when an express has brought us the refreshing news of the capitulation of
St. Johns	PERSON	ー for

		CAPTAIN
ANDREW SNAPE HAMOND	PERSON	, R.N. , TO HANS STANLEY Dear Sir ,
Roebuck	ORGANIZATION	at
Halifax	LOCATION	15th Novr 1775 It will , I am sure , give you pleasure to learn that I am not only arrived in
America	LOCATION	, but that I am also perfectly recovered from a dangerous & obstinate fever , which began the day after we parted at
Yarmouth	LOCATION	, and did not leave me untill we reached the
Western Islands	LOCATION	, however the
Air & Refreshments of Fyal	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- which by the bye is a delightful spot for Climate , soil & fine Views -RRB- together with a constitution naturally a good one , got the better of the disorder , and made the latter part of the voyage , which was tolerably short , not unpleasant to me .

		I arrived here the last day of October , in order to land Comodore & Commissioner
Arbuthnot	PERSON	who was my Passenger , and should have proceeded immedi ately for
Boston	LOCATION	, but we found this place in so defenceless a state ; liable each Night to be surprized by the Rebels ; that it was thought necessary the Roebuck should remain here , for a further security to the Kings Dock yard , untill the Admirals pleasure should be known .

		I need not point out to you , Sir , the great importance this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	is of to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, as besides the immense supplys of
Cattle Wood & Hay	ORGANIZATION	it has sent to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	, it is the only one acknowledging at present the Kings Government ; therefore how necessary it is to secure it !

		By our last accounts from
Boston	LOCATION	, every thing remained as General
Gage	PERSON	had left it , or at least nothing material had happened .

		From all I am able to learn here , I can not help concluding that the whole conduct of the Summer Campaign has been nothing but a scene of repeated blunders , I speak chiefly of the Sea department .

		The affair of
Bunker Hill	PERSON	was owing to the removal of the
Somerset	LOCATION	from
Charles Town	PERSON	, as whilst she lay there , the Rebels could not take
Post	ORGANIZATION	on Bunker hill ; and the loss we sustained there was caused by a manifest mistake of sending the small Vessels up a
River	LOCATION	to the left when they ought to have gone to the river on the right , which would have carried them within two hundred yards of
Charles Town Neck	LOCATION	.

		The Frigates were also wrong placed , calculated merely to cover the landing , and neglected proceeding to a spot where they might have enfiladed the Rebels behind that fatal farm which did us so much mischief .

		I write in a great hurry to save an opportunity that offers of sending this letter by a ship that has called in here merely to clear out of the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	, and is now under sa , il .

		I have therefore only time to desire you will present my respect ful regards to Mr
Jenkinson	PERSON	,
Dr Oylez	PERSON	-LSB- & c. -RSB-
A. S. Hamond	PERSON	P.S. .

		We are extreamly anxious to hear from
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The People here dont think it unlikely that should the Rebels fail there they will pay this place a visit on their return .

		This I think is but barely possible , but if they should we shall be prepared for them .

Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		And as they have two Priveteers out of Connecticutt & two from this Colony the Small Tenders keep in Close to the Men of War I dont beleave it would be Worth , or that it would Cost 10 pCt to Insure it from
St Peters	ORGANIZATION	, Nor near so much to go to
Stoningtown	LOCATION	,
New London	LOCATION	, New haven , or Sag harbore on
Long Isld	LOCATION	at all which places you are well Acquainted & When Arrived at Sag Harbore it may be known whether safe to Come in here ー You Must know Sr the Grand Advantage would be in bringin the Powder , as the

		The

Guilford	PERSON	, and that the same being sufficiently proved , the schooner
Betsey	PERSON	, mentioned in said memorial , ought to be permitted to proceed on her voyage , with the cargo purchased and provided for her before the 10th day of September last , the master and owner of the vessel previously making oath , that they will use their best and utmost endeavours , that the said Cargo shall be landed in some foreign port .

Sansom	PERSON	and company ,
Jacob Watson	PERSON	, and
Frederick Rhinelander	PERSON	, of the city of

Committee	ORGANIZATION	having examined as far as they could , into the conduct of the parties concerned , find no ground to suspect that the owners of the cargo intended it should be landed or disposed of in any other manner than set forth in the said memorial , but your
Committee	ORGANIZATION	think there are just grounds to suspect , that
William Barron	PERSON	, the master of the ship
Peggy	PERSON	, would not be very solicitous to prevent the cargo , which might be useful to the ministerial army , from falling into the possession of the men of war , he having been before taken in the same ship , in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, with a cargo from
Chesapeak Bay	LOCATION	, for
Europe	LOCATION	, nor can your
Committee	ORGANIZATION	approve the conduct of the Owner of the Ship who continued the captain afterwards .

		Your Committee are therefore of opinion , that another master ought to be appointed to the said ship , who shall be approved by the committee of
Norwich	LOCATION	, and that the time of her sailing , as well as her tract be appointed by that committee , and the master sworn to use his best endeavours to prevent the said ship falling into the possession of any men of war or cutter , and to pursue as far as he can , the orders of the said committee in navigating the said ship , on which terms your Committee are of opinion , the said ship ought to be permitted to proceed with her cargo .

		The other sentinel loaded again and fired , the boat still rowing on till within 20 yards of the shore , when he discharged his rifle a third time , upon which he heard a terrible shrieking on board , and found that they tacked about and made off ; so that , before capt.
Green	PERSON	could come up , this brave fellow had repulsed a boat crowded with men .

SHUBAEL LOVELL	PERSON	TO CAPTAIN

Nantucket	LOCATION	, November 16 , 1775 .

		After my humble respects to you , I am very sorry of the misfortune you met with , as I was informed , by the master of your tender , that you had very much hurt one of your eyes , which I took this opportunity to let you know that I am still a good friend to Government , and to let you know , by writing , that I never have been actor in any things against Government , and have never taken up any carnal weapons against the
King	ORGANIZATION	's troops , but have suffered so as to have my gun taken from me , because I have bore my testimony against the measures that the
America	LOCATION	have taken to get their liberties , as they say they do ; and , as I will not take up arms against the
King	ORGANIZATION	's troops , and to rightly bear the title of a Rebel against my King , I have been threatened of being shot by those that is greatly against Government , yet I never intend to take up aims -LRB- through Divine assistance , although I may lose my life , -RRB- against my King , knowing he has undoubted right to be a terror to evil-doers , and I hope he will be a praise to them that do right .

		Captain
Ayscough	PERSON	, I shall take it a great favour , and should be humbly obliged to you , if you would inform the Governour and Admiral of me , as it is not a thing impossible for me -LRB- by land -RRB- to get a letter to
Boston	LOCATION	, or to come myself , to let them know my mind , without risking my life , and wife and children 's lives , and to lose all my estate ; and , as you took me and my schooner , about two or three months ago , as I was going into
Nantucket	LOCATION	, and did use me with great civility , and I did then let you know my mind about the forces , and you did take my name down , and where I lived , which now makes me to take the boldness to trouble you with these few lines , desiring you would oblige me so much as to do all you can for me in these evil times , that if it should please the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Majesty to show any mercy to any innocent persons , that I might share part with such , as a true
King	ORGANIZATION	's subject , so that I might save my life and estate , if the King should conquer the
America	LOCATION	.

		And I would , also , inform you that I have got a brother , and a cousin , whose name is
Daniel Lovell	PERSON	and

		Sir , Your proposals for a truce with this town were laid before us yesterday , by a

		We should be happy in complying with them , but our very unhapply situation we fear is such , that however anxious we are to comply with your proposals , we shall not have it in our power , unless Capt.

Samuel Dyre	PERSON	,

		If Capt.

Dyre	PERSON	, we hope the truce may be preserved ; and you may be assured every thing shall be done by us , and the greatest part of the inhabitants remaining in town , that it shall not be violated on our parts .

Providence Gazette	ORGANIZATION	, December 9 , 1775 .

		CAPTAIN
BERNARD	PERSON	ROMANS TO THE COMMISSIONERS FOR FORTIFICATIONS IN THE HIGHLANDS Gentlemen ー Martler 's Rock , 16th Nov. 1775 .

		As I am a great hater of epistolary altercation , I was not willing to answer your long starter of difficulties , which seems to me a declared commencement of a paper war instead of an answer to my reasonable remonstrances of 2d instant ; but as I am determined that you should not think yourselves unanswerable , I resolved this morning to honour your long answer with as short a reply as the nature of things will allow ; at the same time assuring you that this is the last paper I shall blacken on this head , and that I will take care that my pen shall proclaim the voice of truth .

		Your introduction seems intended to be of the humorous kind .

		You play on my words and call a conspicuous light what I called a rank .

		I will do no more than think as I did then ; and as in a private station I have more than once exerted myself for
America	LOCATION	, you may rely on it that I will do no less , now I am honoured with the post and rank the -LSB- Provincial -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has conferred on me , the dignity of which commission I shall try to preserve with military vigilance and spirit .

		To your first , wherein you say , `` it was my duty to let the commissioners know the proportion of labourers wanted to the artificers . ''

		I knew my duty , I did it , and so I did to the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	, which last , I dare say remember my complaint about it ; and if the commissioners ' memory fail them , some one of them may remember when one evening we were on that topic , I ventured to say , that since my plan was approved of , I thought myself the person who should direct all .

		The polite answer I got on that head I have not forgot , though it made me resolve an imposition of silence on myself till the state of affairs would naturally dispose matters to flow in their proper channels .

		How far you are judges of work I know not , as I am not acquainted with your extent of experience , but I often heard you complain about the freezing out of the masonry .

		I beg leave to inform you that on a single brick wall of 9 inches , a frost may take out 3 inches on each side , but it can not take out quite so much of .

		our wall ; because , as the thickness increases , the effect of the frost decreases , and can not be more than 2 inches at most on the outside of our works , which must be pointed over again in the spring ; and this new pointing I mentioned before ten stones were laid in the wall .

		All men who ever were necessitated to work late in thick work , will , from experience , vouch the truth of my assertion .

		To your second and third , relating to the block house , I did not exaggerate my number of carpenters .

		I still stand to my promise and can do it .

		I do not remember any expostulations , except shrugging up shoulders can be called so , for that always was the answer to my many times repeated plaints in regard of hewing and rehewing of the timber , and whenever that kind of expostulation happened , I used to recollect your original polite answer of `` We are not grown so old to allow you to direct the work . ''

		With regard to a road , you made your landing in a wrong place before I came here ; and when I used to be angry at so many hands working on roads at unseasonable times and unnecessary .

		places , I always got my labour for my pains ; and how shortly is it ago since I got the ill will of one of you for barely telling the labourers that there was no necessity to remove a certain stone laying near a road which was then making ?

		My proposal of oxen was as soon as they became necessary , and I then said buying was preferable to hiring , unless people would bring forage along with them .

		You might have bought them , but instead of that , you countermanded some that were bought , as you did of getting of timber , even now before one-fifth of the timber is got that is mentioned in my estimate .

		What you mean by an elegant outside appearance , I can not conceive .

		My calculations of the necessary iron work is just , except indeed , the rings and staples outside of the ports , which I never thought of , nor would have had them there had you not ordered some one to put them there .

		About the `` inside lined with so much ' nicety and expence , '' the extra cost of this , is no more than one day and a half easy work for a carpenter , -LRB- about 14s . -RRB-

		for it must be lined let who will live in it , and as it generally is the residence of an officer , as this is now for me , I thought passing the jack plane over one side of the lining was the least that could be done .

		What would you have said , had I lined the roof , divided the lower room with panel partitions , and put up a panel ceiling to remove and put up at pleasure ?

		for most block houses are so , and the meanest are partitioned .

		It seems your ideas of a temporary work is , that it ought to last six months ー to build a new one again .

		As to trunnels , I ordered 2,000 of oak , when locust was not to be had .

		I do not know what ruined your credit , but the badness of that among the country people prevents your getting anything regularly .

		I planned , gentlemen , but remember you ordered even that , though you could not so well direct that case as you could when you spoiled my plan of the barracks .

		What you mean by a waste of timber , I am utterly at a loss for ; my order of 18 feet long was right , and had I ordered them the just length , they might have come 3 inches too short , and then indeed it would have been waste ; but had they been 3 inches too long , the sawing off of 3 inches would take as long time as sawing off 2 , 3 and 10 feet , which I wanted elsewhere .

		The day I got your epistle , I looked around the works for waste timber ; I saw none but chips , and I confess , I was struck with the thought , what a pity it was nature gave our carpenters so much trouble .

		The truth is , gentlemen , you have no business with my calculations of the kind , you are to judge afterwards ; you have before now , seen what your no trifling extraordinary expense of timber goes to .

		The mention you make of the pieces being unwieldy is curious ; I can not see what odds it made to the men , to have them sawed at the landing or at the mill ; they would have been 11 feet in either case ; and excepting some trifling iron work , that was not finished , I was right in my judgment about the 10th of November , for that day I lived in it , and I received your letter there .

		By what necessity do you introduce the order for mounting 12 guns ?

		have I ever opposed it , and are we not on the point of having 20 ?

		To your fourth , I must tell you , that Mr.
White	PERSON	, the master carpenter , being an acquaintance of Mr.
-LSB- Samuel -RSB- Bayard	PERSON	, was indulged with the liberty to make evening visits to you , and this gave rise to a distinction , insomuch that Mr.
Addams	PERSON	has been told to let Mr.
White	PERSON	go on with such and such particular work , he ,
Addams	PERSON	, need not trouble himself about it ; this produced two master carpenters , and
Addams	PERSON	justly complained of the matter , because
White	PERSON	, at first , treated him as his superior , but at length became his equal .

		Yet , still , I think as I did then , country carpenters are preferable , and what makes the use of them impolitic , is a conception beyond my ideas .

		Fifthly .

		My calculation of the oxen 's work is evident ; I can show you how a teamster himself and one man may load his cart ; but as every country clown knows how , it is below me , even while I am the paltry being that is not allowed to direct his own plan , for as the helping of the oxen is the finest skulking berth our labourers can find , I do not know whether I would be safe in destroying it , while I have no command .

		But , gentlemen , your wheels were too low , and when a new pair was bespoke , I pleaded long to have them timber wheels ; but no , they must be common cart wheels ; and now they are come , they are common cart wheels indeed .

		As to the six men employed to steady the stone , I only tried the oxen -LRB- twice -RRB- on the wall , and found the fear of the animals made it unsafe ; I desisted , therefore , and men only have done it .

		You will please to remember , that that machine was no cart , and with it I have brought stones of two ton weight to the wall , very different from a piece of timber of 10 or even 8 feet long ; it was my invention , but any body might have thought of that , as well as of
Columbus	LOCATION	's egg .

		If my calculation of forage is below the mark , please to know that it is far above what the people of the country allow to their cattle .

		Sixthly .

		Labourers may be had under the regulations I mentioned ; I can get 500 if need be .

		In your seventh , you catch at my word `` superficial , '' as drowning people do at straws .

		I will tell you something , perhaps to you extraordinary ; what I call a `` superficial '' view , was such as most other surveyors would call a perfect survey .

		I am , from long experience , enabled to take more exact surveys of places with a piece of paper and pencil , than perhaps 99 beside me can , with all the circumstantial apparatus generally used .

		It is true , I forgot the iron for the barracks , but have you mended that mistake by using nearly as much on one block house as I intended to use for the whole work ?

		Glass is a trifle ; 318 panes cost about # 6 12s .6 d. Transport of stores surely includes freight for board and shingles : and work to be made on the spot by the blacksmith , surely shewed , that I was aware more iron would be required than I could think of : In short , I am more and more convinced , that my estimate is right ; the price of the article of lime only , excepted , which I calculated at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	or New-England price , little dreaming that it cost above twice as much in New-York .

		To your eighth , I insist upon it , you must have miners here .

		And as to the labourers mauling the stone , need I tell you , gentlemen , that I have of ten been out of all humour , to see them work in stone that would not split , as I knew how to get them to the wall of any size ; but here , again , my authority failed me .

		To the beginning of your ninth , I have perhaps gone a little below the dignity of my office .

		This proceeded chiefly , because I found that many of our gentry took the advantage of drawing their provisions when they intended to decamp the very next morning .

		But what I mentioned about tools in this article , is what you ought to have answered : here I spoke in my proper sphere ; but this you waived , to proceed to a matter , which , had I not been convinced of the integrity of your transcriber , I could have never thought would have proceeded from you .

		It looks so much like the little vengeance of disappointed scolds .

		I deny your ever having requested me to send my negro away .

		Mr.
-LSB- William -RSB- Bedlow	PERSON	once told me this : `` Mr.
Romans	PERSON	, you had better get a place for your negro ; '' but I could not construe this into a request , much less an order from men who have no manner of authority over me .

		The negro is more rogue than fool ; but he is so harmless , that while people let him alone , he will be quiet .

		He is a new negro , and by his actions he sometimes diverts your people ; but I defy you to point out a single instance of dissatisfaction on that score .

		Once , indeed , there was a complaint against him , for which I gave him a severe chastisement , and you know that I had reason to be sorry , when -LRB- almost immediately after -RRB- his innocence appeared .

		But , gentlemen , he never cost you nor the country any thing , as there was never an ounce of provision served out for him ; he has lived on scraps from others ; and he must be a sorry dog indeed , that does not deserve the crumbs from his master 's table ; he might at least , serve me to fetch wood and water .

		I have provided a place for him , but not in obedience to you .

		It is hard indeed that I , who in my private station , have for many years past never been without a servant , or even two or three , should be raised to a public one , to be debarred that privilege .

		I know no place where so cruel a prohibition would take place ; while I was in the service of the King my pay was greater , and I had sundry rations allowed , although my servants were in pay and drew provisions besides .

		Since I arrived last to the northward , now near three years ago , I have always maintained and fed a number of people , seldom less than six , at high wages , and now not to be allowed any attendance at all , is surely never meant .

		People whose duty it was to ask me whether I was in want of any thing , have been reprimended for coming to the block house ; but your mention of Mr.
Addams	PERSON	astonishes me beyond every thing ; was it necessary , my copy book would show you his handwriting , to make it appear that he has for years back transacted my business ; he is a gentleman in whose fortunes I am interested , and I will assist him with all my means .

		You say '' He is an officer that you can by no means allow of . ''

		Sure I want him not to be your officer , if he is mine it is enough ; and to it you add , '' If you retain him , pay and procure provisions for him ; '' how mean the inuendo !

		I have often done it .

		It is true it was said Mr.
Vandome	PERSON	was to assist me ; he came up to be the clerk of the cheque , and as such you retained him ; but since I saw him employed as commissary of stores , and as clerk to the commissioners as well as clerk of the cheque , I thought it cruel to ask assistance from him , my business well followed is three men 's work .

		Perhaps you think me your officer too .

		Softly , gentlemen ; that will never do .

		The -LSB- Provincial -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	appointed me to a rank I esteem more honourable than any I ever held , yet for 14 years back I have been sometimes employed as a commodore in the King 's service ; sometimes at the head of large bodies of men in the woods ; and at the worst of times I have been master of a merchantman fitted in a warlike manner .

		I will in future draw the provisions the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will allow me , and that will maintain us both .

		To your tenth I have nothing to reply .

		But your lastly is too important to let pass unnoticed ー the necessary alterations must be made before the work goes on well ; and as for seasons , such business as this waits none , if we keep not the work going , we will in spring again be new beginners .

		I interrupt none of your powers ; I meddle with none ; but you have hindered me from having as much again work done , and till I am sole director of my plan , things can not go well .

		None can be more happy in the union you mention ; but if I must be cap in hand , gentlemen , to be an overseer under you , it will not do , depend upon it , I have too much blood in me for so mean an action , and you must seek such submissive engineers elsewhere .

		If I execute my plan which is approved of , I have no business to consult you any farther than that you must find me people and pay them ; if in that case , I do not comply with my enterprise , then is your -LSB- duty -RSB- to disapprove and complain , but not before .

		16th .

		1775 .

		Last week the King
Fisher	PERSON	and four tenders full of men came up to Burwells Ferry and made several attempts to land during three days stay , but never came nearer than to receive a discharge of the Rifles , when they retired with great pricipitation , and 't is Supposed the loss of some men .

		They had in -LSB- the ? -RSB-

		time a droll contest for a small Cyder boat with one man , who lay between them about 200 yds .

		from shore .

		He attempted to come on Shore , when a Cannon Ball from the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	passed just over his head and deter 'd him .

		He then set.sail for them , when a Rifle brought him too ; he gave a
Signal	ORGANIZATION	to the Man of War , who sent a Boat full of men for him , but When near , a Volly of Rifle bullets hurried them back without their prize .

		This was several times repeated 'til the
Fleet	ORGANIZATION	moved up to
James Town	PERSON	, when the Riflemen seised the Boat , but the Man and Cyder were gone ... .

		Nor do I think Ld .


Dunmore	PERSON	will be so sanguine about his Piratical War , as he was , since he finds that small Arms in the hands of a few men will keep numbers from landing .

		His slave scheme is also at an end , since it is now Public that he has sent off a sloop load to the
West Indies	LOCATION	, which has made others use every endeavor to escape from him , and will stop his further increase of that Crew .

Great Bridge	LOCATION	, in
Norfolk county	LOCATION	, in order to take up the bridge , and reconnoitre the ground , expecting our troops to meet them by that time , and give them battle ; but being well informed that they were not near , and hearing of about 150 of the Princess
Anne	PERSON	militia being on their march to meet our men , instead of waiting for our regulars , marched in quest of those few friends in that part of the world , who with bravery , and warmed with the justice of their cause , fought with courage , which we hope will shine in every American 's heart , till overpowered with numbers , were obliged to retreat , with the loss of colonel
T. R. Walker	PERSON	, Mr.
John Reade	PERSON	, and two other gentlemen , who were killed on the spot , and colonel -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Hutchings	PERSON	, and a few others , taken prisoners .

SAMUEL JOHNSTON	PERSON	TO
JOSIAH MARTIN Sir Edenton Novr	PERSON	16th 1775 I have this day had the honour of receiving your Excellency 's Letter signi fying that you had been pleased to suspend me from acting as Deputy to Mr

		At the same time that I hold myself obliged to your Excellency for the Polite manner in which you are pleased to express yourself of my private Character , you will pardon me for saying that I think I have reason to complain of the invidious point of view in which you place my publick Transactions , when you consider the late meeting of the Delegates or Deputies of the Inhabitants of this Province at
Hillsborough	LOCATION	, a Body of my own Creation , Your Excellency can not be ignorant that I was a mere Instrument in this Business under the direction of the people , a people among whom I have long resided , who have on all occasions placed the greatest Confidence in me , to whose favourable Opinion I owe everything I possess and to whom I am bound by Gratitude -LRB- that most powerfull & inviolable tie on every honest mind -RRB- to render every Service they can demand of me , in defence of what they esteem their just rights , at the risque of my Life & Property You will further , Sir , be pleased to understand , that I never considered myself in the honorable light in which you place me , one of the King 's Servants ; being entirely unknown to those who have the disposal of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's favours , I never enjoyed nor had I a right to expect , any Office under his Majesty ; the Office which I have for some years past executed under the Deputation of Mr
Turner	PERSON	was an honest purchase for which I have punctually paid an Annual Sum , which I shall continue to pay till the expiration of the Term for which I should have held it agreeably to our Contract .

		Permit me , Sir , to add that had all the King 's Servants in this Province been as well informed of the disposition of the Inhabitants as they might have been and taken the same pains to promote & preserve peace , good order & Obedience to the Laws among them , that I flatter myself I have done , the Source of your Excellency 's unceasing Lamentations had not at this day existed or had it existed it would have been in so small a degree that e'er this it would have been nearly exhausted ; but , Sir , a Recapitulation of Errors which it is now too late to correct would be painfull to me and might appear impertinent to your Excellency , I shall therefore decline the ungratefull Task , and beg leave , with all due respect to subscribe myself Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB- 1 .

PENNSYLVANIA	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY TO
JAMES MAUL Philadelphia	LOCATION	, Nov. 17 , 1775 .

		The
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	judging it extremely necessary that a suitable Person , with a Boat , be station 'd near the mouth of the
River Delaware	LOCATION	, to give the earliest Notice of the approach of any English Ships of War that may be destin 'd against this City , you are hereby appointed to that Service in Confidence , that you will exert the utmost Vigilance and Industry in procuring and forward Intelligence of this Nature .

		You are therefore , without loss of
Time	ORGANIZATION	, to take on board your Pilot Boat four Persons besides yourself , three of whom to be Men , and such as you have Reason to believe will be sober and attentive to their Duty , and proceed to the Thoroughfare below
Reedy Island	LOCATION	, which is to be your general Station , with Liberty sometimes to run down to the
Thrum-Cap Road	LOCATION	.

		In this Station you are to remain untill recall 'd by us , observing to keep a constant Look out , both Day and Night , and setting an exact and regular Watch of two Men .

		From the Receipt of Advice from Mr.
Henry Fisher	PERSON	, of
Lewis Town	LOCATION	, or by means of Vessels or otherwise , of a Ship or Ships of War coming into the Bay , you are to come up directly to New Castle , and after lodging Information with the Commander of that Town , who will forward the
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	to
Fort Island	LOCATION	and to the Committee of Safety here , you are instantly to return to your Ground .

		But if your Advices should be of a very alarming Nature , such as the arrival of several Men of War , or if only a few , but of considerable Force as large Frigates , and you are of Opinion you could as soon , or sooner , reach
Fort Island	LOCATION	than an Express by Land , you must in that Case , besides calling at
New Castle	LOCATION	, run up in all haste to
Fort Island	LOCATION	, and on coming in Sight of the Island hoist certain Signals , which the commanding Officer of the Armed Boats there is to be made first acquainted with .

		If on the contrary , the Ships should be few or but of small Force , you are not to quit your Station otherwise than in running up to New Castle as above directed , untill they heave in Sight .

		You are to apprise all Vessels of their Danger , unless it should oblige you to run out of your way in coming up to lose time in reaching it .

		For these Services , you are to be allowed for your self , Boat and Men , Twenty five Shillings P Day .

		It is impossible to instruct you how to act under particular Circumstances and Situations not forseen by us , but we depend in all these Cases upon your Zeal for the publick Service , and on your Fidelity to the -LSB- Trust -RSB- reposed in you , which you ought to consider as extremely important .

Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	had adjourned before your Letter arrived here & of Consequence no Answer could be had from them , I have taken the Liberty of writing what I conceive to be at least the Substance of what they would have written .

		There was as far as I can discover no Foundation for the Report you mention ; but unhappily , last Night an Express arrived in Town bringing an Account , that on Monday last -LSB- November 13 -RSB- Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	having heard that a large Body of our Forces were marching to
Norfolk	LOCATION	under Col.
Woodford	PERSON	, marched at the Head of 350 Men consisting of
Soldiers Sailors Negroes & Scotchmen	ORGANIZATION	, to the great Bridge to destroy it & prevent the Passage of our Men ー that he effected this , & then went in prosuit of 150 Militia of Princess
Ann	PERSON	who had imprudently marched induced by a false Report to join Col.
Woodford	PERSON	, who was at that Time with a Part of his Regiment in
Wmsburg	LOCATION	That this Party came up with our Militia , who defended themselves with Bravery , but being overpower 'd by Numbers were totally defeated several killed & others taken Prisoners , amongst whom was Col.
Joseph Hutchings	PERSON	ー This Affair I hope will serve to rouse up our Country Men , & will serve to lead our Enemies into such another Scrape as they ran into at
Hampton	ORGANIZATION	ー The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	had resolved a Month ago to send dowp .

		the 2d Regimt & the Culpeper Batalion of Minute Men to
Norfolk	LOCATION	ー but for want of Arms Tents & c & c they were unable to march , the whole of them til the Day before Yesterday ー A Detachment passed
Jas River	LOCATION	about 10 days since under Major
Spotswood	LOCATION	ー & were ordered to halt at
Cobham	LOCATION	til joined by the Col. & Remainder of the Forces This Junction was delayed several Days for want of Necessaries , & several more by high Winds & the Interposition of the King Fisher & several Tenders ー which obliged our Men to cross the River higher up than was at first intended ー This Delay for Want of proper Arms & c has been very mortifying to us , & has proved fatal to our Friends in the Neighbourhood of
Norfolk	LOCATION	ー
Purdie	PERSON	's Paper contains a particular & true Account of what has been attempted by the Man of War & Tenders & what has passed between them & our Men here ー The naval & Land Forces of Ld D -- are as described in Letter from the Committee by the last Post The
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	would gladly have written you an Account of the State of Affairs here by every Post ー had they not been hindered by a Multiplicity of Business ー As I intend to reside here with my Family I will transmit you any Intelligence worth your Notice & shall be proud to receive your Commands with Respect to procuring such as you may desire to receive ー My Health will not permit me to write but a few Lines ー I have therefore scribbled to you in Haste what I am unable to transcribe ー you will excuse my Scrawl & Blunders ー & believe me to be -LSB- & c. -RSB-

VIRGINIA	LOCATION	GAZETTE , FRIDAY , NOVEMBER 17 , 1775
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, November 17 .

		Col. -LSB- Patrick -RSB-
Henry	PERSON	received an express yesterday morning with the following intelligence , viz. that Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, having received advice that about 200 of the Princess
Anne	PERSON	militia were on the march to join the troops destined for the protection of the lower parts of the country , marched from
Norfolk	LOCATION	last Tuesday -LSB- November 14 -RSB- , about 10 o'clock P.M. to intercept them ; who , not having the least intelligence of his lordship 's approach , were obliged to engage under every disadvantage , both as to the enemy 's superiority in point of numbers , and the situation of the ground , being hemmed in by a fence .

		Our people fought a considerable time , and it is thought did great execution ; but were at last overpowered , and forced to retreat , with the loss of mr.
John Ackiss	PERSON	in the minute service , killed on the spot , and col.
Joseph Hutchings	PERSON	, and one
mr. Williams	PERSON	, wounded , who were taken prisoners , with seven others .

		The publick , no doubt , will be exceedingly incensed on finding that lord
Dunmore	PERSON	has taken into his service the very scum of the country to assist him in his diabolical schemes against the good people of this government , all well attached to his majesty , but mortal enemies to his infamous ministry and their subordinate tools ; but it is to be hoped his sphere of mischief will soon be circumscribed within narrow bounds , as col.
Woodford	PERSON	, with about 800 as brave troops as the world can produce , are now on their march to
Norfolk	LOCATION	, and , should his lordship incline to give them battle , we have not the smallest doubt will give a very satisfactory account of him .


GEORGE GAULD	PERSON	TO VICE ADMIRAL
CLARK GAYTON	PERSON	Sir
Pensacola	PERSON	17th Novr 1775 On our return to this place I was honoured with your Letter of the 9th of July last , wherein you acquaint me of your having received the Plan of our Summer 's work before last .

		ー By the Sloop 's coming here so soon we were able to set out early in the Summer , and return here in good Season before the cold stormy weather set in .

		I hope this will always be the case , as we can do our Business more effectually , and with greater Satisfaction .

		We began where we left off last year , and have carried on the Survey as far as
Cayo Largo	PERSON	, to what I believe may properly be called
Cape Florida	LOCATION	in the Latitude of about 25 degrees North .

		We met with no good Harbours this year , for large Vessels , but a great many dangers to which they may be exposed .

		I shall endeavour to send a fair Copy by the Diligence or the next safe opportunity that offers .

		We met with two of His Majesty 's Vessels last Summer along the Kays , vizt the Savage Sloop of War and the Saint
John Schooner	PERSON	, from
Providence	LOCATION	for
Pensacola	LOCATION	: both of them went all the way between the Reef and the Kays ; and as we happened to be at
Cayo Huesso	PERSON	when the Savage was passing by Mr.
Payne	PERSON	piloted her into the
Harbour	LOCATION	, where we then lay , at the desire of Captain -LSB-
Hugh -RSB- Bromadge	PERSON	, who did not expect to find a Harbour there .

		It were greatly to be wished that it was more generally known on account of its vicinity to the
Ravanna	PERSON	, as Frigates and even fifty Gun Ships might easily go in and anchor there in great safety .

		I have enclosed two Setts of Certificates for two half years Pay , which I beg you will be kind enough to sign and send down when it is convenient .

Somerset	LOCATION	under Orders to proceed to
England	LOCATION	when I came here , who I have detained as well as the
Roebuck	ORGANIZATION	, which will I hope merit their Lordships approbation , I presume Captain Spry an Engineer at this place may have had orders from the General to set about securing this Yard because nothing had been done of consequence but within a fortnight .

		It is an unpleasant situation to defend because it is commanded by
Hills	PERSON	, every way towards the Land which rises with a tolerable quick asscent but very regular for 600 Yards in the front of the Yard .

		Captain Spry is raising a platform round the Wall within for Men to fire over besides two redoubts one at each end in front to scower the Curtain .

		We shall likewise lose no time in strengthening the N : E & S : W : sides of the Yard the latter having nothing but a few trifling pallisades lately put up to keep the Seamen from getting out of the Yard which at low water for a considerable way is but 6 Inches deep towards the
Harbour	LOCATION	, the other is overlooked by a steep
Hill	PERSON	within forty Yards those we shall raise and put a platform also besides at each of those Extremeties are the
Somerset	LOCATION	and
Roebuck	ORGANIZATION	moored with springs on their Cables , to prevent any impression on those places from succeeding , and likewise for scowering the aforesaid
Hill	PERSON	upon the whole as soon as the Yard is completed , if those Gentry do not bring Cannon which I do not think they can we shall be able to give them a warm reception .

		`` BRITANNICUS '' TO GEORGE WASHINGTON Sir The enclosed Papers I Received a few days ago .

		I suppose they came from Mr Hitchborn .

		2 He appears very certain the Preston might be taken , but from her Situation , and being unrigged , it will be very Difficult , if not Impossible to secure her , for as soon as daylight appears , she might be Beat to Pieces by the Batteries of the Town , to which she would be a fair mark ; or she might be retaken by being Boarded from the other Ships and Transports , which can furnish -LRB- together with the Town -RRB- a large Body of Men for that purpose .

		If she could be taken , but not carried off , would it not be an Essential object to Secure her Powder and Small Arms ?

		for which purpose a Sufficient number of Whale Boats might Remove them to
Chelsea	LOCATION	in a short time and afterward -LSB- s -RSB- the Ship be Burnt : first Removeing the men to

		which , According to H -- lies near the
west End of Spectacle Island	LOCATION	rigged .

		If she could be taken , she might be , from her Situation , not only secured , but made good use of for taking the Castle , which perhaps in its present dismembered state might be attended with no great Difficulty .

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES -LSB- Boston November 18 , 1775 -RSB- 2 The Commander of the Hinchinbrook , who arrived -LSB- November 17 -RSB- a few days afterwards , reported however that since the first day of sailing from
Boston	LOCATION	, when he chased a Pirate into
Salem	LOCATION	, he had not seen an Enemy .

		Nevertheless the Admiral being anxious for the Safety of this Vessel , 3 and intent upon using every means to prevent her falling into the hands of the Enemy , ordered the Hinchinbrook out again , and the Nautilus ; and they sailed accordingly within a day of each other .

		He determined also that the Lively should follow as soon as possible , and , as the
Fowey	LOCATION	and Tartar were hourly expected , he designed to make the latter , being clean , relieve the Mercury that was in great Want of careening .

		These Ships were , agreeably to the Admirals constant Orders to the Cruizers in

Quebec	LOCATION	side , that he had been near surprizing the Town ー that it was closely invested , that they were in the greatest confusion within , the Inhabitants having refused to take arms , a Scarcity of provisions & Wood must bring the Garrison to Terms , were a blockade alone to be the measure adopted 2 ー Mr
Carlton	PERSON	is in Statue Quo , about fifteen Miles on this side
Sorel	PERSON	where I hope they will not let him pass .

		suppose Mr
Carlton	PERSON	is on board the Fleet which left this upon my arrival , as I have never had any account of his making his escape .

		I have not yet been able to adjust the new form 'd
Corps	ORGANIZATION	or get our warm Clothing ready to go down touching which I am exceedingly impatient ,
Arnold	PERSON	having no artillery & being in want of warm Cloathing .

		ー I have appointed a Mr
Mason	PERSON	-LRB- One of our friends in this Town -RRB- Post Master till the pleasure of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	be known .

		I find Mr Price so active , & intelligent , so warm a friend to the measures adopted by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that I wish to have him mentioned in the Strongest terms to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	ー I have set a Regiment on foot of Canadians
James Livingston	PERSON	Colonel ー to be engaged for 12 Months , should this unhappy controvery last so long .

		I have made the Inhabitants acquainted with the views of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, relative to this Province , declaring I shoud call a convention upon my return from
Quebec	LOCATION	, I have had some conversation with
Pere Flacquet	PERSON	a Jesuit at the head of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	here , & Esteemed a very Sensible fellow , he complaind of some little indignities shewn their order , particularly in making part of their house the common prison by his Majesty 's Governors , I promised redress & hinted at the same time , the great probability of that
Society	ORGANIZATION	enjoying their estate -LRB- notwithstanding Sir
Jeffery	PERSON	-LSB-
Amherst	LOCATION	's -RSB- pretensions -RRB- should this province accede to the
General Union	ORGANIZATION	ー I hope this hint may be of Service , the Priests hitherto having done us the Mischief in their power in many parishes , they will not yet give the people Absolution ー However I have shewn all the respect in my power to Religion & have winked at this behaviour in the priests for fear of giving malice a handle .

		I wish I could have apprized you in time of your obligations to Capt
McKay	PERSON	he generously offerd Mr
Carlton	PERSON	if he would give him Two hundred Men , to go & burn the New Church at
Saratoga	LOCATION	last Summer , ー he is so inveterate a fellow that I think if the other prisoners should be indulged in returning to their familys this winter , he ought not to be permitted to enter this province , when a Convention is Assembled , I propose requesting the return of the other Gentlemen on their parole .

		The inhabitants are our friends on both sides of the
River	LOCATION	to
Quebec	LOCATION	, our expresses go without interruption backwards & forwards , a young Man who is got out of
Quebec	LOCATION	informs me that the Lieut : Governor , the Chief Justice & Several others have put their baggage on board Ship , & that no ship is permitted to Sail , ー this looks as if they despaired of making a defence .


Colo McClean	PERSON	has threatned a Sortie .


Arnold	ORGANIZATION	is apprized of it , & his troops wish for it ー I hear there is a considerable quantity of powder at
Niagara	LOCATION	, perhaps this may be thought an object worthy of attention , they have been very apprehensive of an attack from the virginians in that quarter , all this Summer .

		I fear
Carlton	PERSON	has thrown a great quantity of powder into the River , ー I have desird a Severe message to be delivered to him on that Subject ー Farewell my Dear Sir , & believe me with all regard & respect -LSB- & c. -RSB- Rich d

Camp Cambridge	LOCATION	, November 19 , 1775 .

		The Resolve to raise two Battalions of Marines , will -LRB- if practicable in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- entirely derange what has been done .

		It is therein mentioned , one Colonel for the two Battalions , of course a Colonel must be dismissed : One of the many difficulties which attended the New Arrangement , was in reconciling the different Interests and Judging of the merits of the different Colonels , in the dismission of this one , the same difficulties will occur .

		The Officers and Men must be acquainted with the maritime Affairs , to comply with which , they must be picked out of the whole
Army	ORGANIZATION	, one from this
Corps	ORGANIZATION	, one from another , so as to break through the whole System , which has cost us so much
Time	ORGANIZATION	, anxiety and pains to bring into any tolerable form .

		Notwithstanding any Difficulties which will arise , you may be assured Sir , that I will use every endeavour to comply with their Resolve .

		I beg leave to submit it to the consideration of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, If those two Battalions can be formed out of this
Army	ORGANIZATION	, Whether this is a Time to weaken our Lines , by employing any of the forces appointed to defend them , on any other Service ?

		As there is every Appearance that this Contest will not be soon decided and of course that there must be an augmentation of the
Continental Army	ORGANIZATION	, would it not be eligible to raise two Battalions of Marines in
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, where there must be now numbers of Sailors unemployed ?

		This however is matter of Opinion , which I mention with all due deference to the Superior Judgment of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	... There is no late Account from Captains
Broughton	PERSON	and
Sellman	PERSON	, the other Cruizers have been chiefly confined to
Harbour	LOCATION	by the Badness of the weather ; 2 1 .

Garrison	PERSON	without the reinforcement from them , I am therefore preparing to lay them up in the best manner the time will admit of as it was determined to defend the place to the last & it appearing it will with difficulty hold out til the middle of May , I think it my Duty to represent to their Lordships the absolute necessity of sending out a sufficient Force & Provisions as early as possible And as Pilots may possibly be wanted have sent home some as likewise the private
Signal	ORGANIZATION	in case the place should be surrendered into the Hands of the Enemy Their Lordships may depend on it no means in my power shall be neglected to destroy the Kings Ships if the place should be destroyed ー The Kings Forces are few the Canadians in general in the Interest of the Rebels , many of the Merchants indifferent so as they secure their property .

		The Garrison is extensive and in a Wretched State and confusion , Many things wanting particularly Match which was said to be in the
Elizabeth Storeship	PERSON	but unloading her to find it , proved to be Twine & Paper , & the whole stock which is supplied by the Men of War ; not exceeding 500 Wt as by the Council of War an Embargo was laid on all Shipping to prevent the Seamen from going out of the Province , as much depends on them in our present situation & have given them directions to lay up their Ships as soon as possible as we are in want of their assistance And as they have shown great allacrity & zeal for His Majestys Service & now lay under many unavoidable losses both to themselves & Owners beg leave to recom mend them to their Lordships for redress , And have inclosed their Petition .

		And as I have ordered Capt -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- McKenzie	PERSON	on Duty on Shore with a Party of Seamen under his command I judged it for the good of His Majestys Service to order

Hunter	PERSON	in his absence We are in daily expectation of Genl
Carleton	PERSON	with about 150 Men with him from

Lt Pringle	PERSON	of His Majs Ship Lizard to whom I beg to refer them who can give a very clear & particular Account of the whole I have sent the Polly on this Service as none of the Kings Vessels could be spared & have given her the preference on account of her Cargo being Flax Seed the property of the two unfortunate Clerks who would be hangd if they fell into the Rebel Hands ー The Things of use for the Garrison I have taken out of the

		CAPTAIN
JOHN HAMILTON	PERSON	, R.N. , TO VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES Sir Consistent with my duty I have the honor to inform you of the result of the Council of War on the 11th instant it was resolved to lay an Embargo , on all Shipping to prevent the Inhabitants from leaving the Province & to detain the Seamen as they would be of particular Service in Our critical situation , to off -LSB- e -RSB- r a reward of 3 pounds for Seamen entering on board the Kings Ships & to -LSB- put -RSB- all things in the best state possible to protect the
Garrison	LOCATION	, the necessity of detaining the Kings Ships til a Council of War was held which was appointed to be on the 16th inst when it was resolved to defend the Garrison to the last .

		The Inhabitants declared it would be impossible to save the place if the Kings Ships went away as there was very few Regulars in the Garrison it was therefore resolved to lay the Ships under my command up and land the Men to do duty on Shore , I therefore gave the necessary Orders for so doing with as great expedition as the time would admit upon a calculation of the Provisions laid before the Council We have not more than will hold out with difficulty to the middle of May therefore it will be absolutely necessary We should be relieved as soon as possible in the Spring , I have inclosed a private
Signal	ORGANIZATION	in case this place should be in the hands of the Enemy which I think can not be the case if We are not betrayed , but if it should be so I shall do all that lies in my power to destroy the Kings Ships to prevent their falling into the Rebels hands .

		I have with the Governors approbation dispatched the two Storeships to
Boston	LOCATION	as the Stores on board them are of no use in the Garrison but of the greatest consequence to the Enemy , And as the situation of Affairs will not permit me to be particular beg leave to refer you to
Lieut Parry	PERSON	of the
Elizabeth Storeship	PERSON	who can inform you of every thing you might wish to know .

		by a Deserter from the Rebels we learn they are in want of Ammunition & Clothing & that they had retreated into the Woods on hearing a

		LIEUTENANT
JOHN STARKE	PERSON	'S SKETCH OF THE WAR IN
CANADA	LOCATION	-LSB-
Quebec	LOCATION	, November 20 -RSB- In the beginning of November 1775 , His Majesty 's Ship the Lizard with a Store Ship under her convoy arrived at
Quebec	LOCATION	, when that Province was invaded by the Rebels , with two different bodies of troops ー One of which , under the command of General
Montgomery	PERSON	, after taking possession of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, and making himself Master of all the Vessels and armed craft on the
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, entered the Province by that rout ー The other under the orders of General
Arnold	PERSON	, made their appearance before
Quebec	LOCATION	, having taken their rout by
Chaudie	PERSON	-LSB- re . -RSB-

		Every place of strength was now in their possession , that city excepted , which had no troops in it , and the Governor Sir
Guy Carleton	PERSON	was absent , who had hastened to endeavour to save
Montreal	LOCATION	, upon receiving information of the progress which Genl
Montgomery	PERSON	had made ー It is not easy to form an adequate idea of the deplorable situation of the Town of
Quebec	LOCATION	at this time .

		The Governor was absent ; the Lieut : Governor a feeble old man was diffident and uncertain what measures to pursue ; there were no troops to make any defence ; all the Artillery mounted on the Ramparts consisted of seven pieces of cannon ; and the Inhabitants were in a state of despondency expecting that the
Army	ORGANIZATION	under
General Arnold	ORGANIZATION	, which having crossed the
River St Lawrence	LOCATION	, occupied the heights of
Abraham	PERSON	close to the city , wou 'd advance and enter the gates without resistance , for such was the consternation , that the gates were not shut , when the enemy was within a mile of them ー And the apprehensions of the Lieut Governor were such , that he thought it adviseable to send back the Store Ship , least she shou 'd fall into the hands of the Rebels ー She took her departure , but fortunately as the events afterwards turned up , was obliged to return , as the River was so much frozen up that it was impossible for her to proceed .

		In this very critical Situation , Captain
Hamilton	PERSON	, since created a Baronet , and his Officers endeavoured to animate and encourage the Inhabitants to take arms in their own defence , by Offering to lay up the Frigate , and disembark his men to do Garrison duty , and to give them every Assistance in their power , for His Majesty 's Service ー At this time ,
Lieut Col Maclean	PERSON	who had crossed the country arrived in the Town with about 100 Men ー His activity and exertions contributed to give spirits to the people , and rouse them from their despondency , and with so good an effect , that when Captain
Hamilton	PERSON	met the principal Inhabitants to know their final determination , they consented to act in their own defence .

		Upon this a Proclamation was published , by the Lieutenant Governor and Captain
Hamilton	PERSON	, laying an embargo upon all the Shipping in the
River	LOCATION	; and by way of farther precaution , his boats crews were ordered to unbend the sails and carry them on shore , to prevent such Vessels as might be so disposed , from leaving the place ー The Officers and Men belonging to His Majesty 's Ship the Lizard , the Hunter Sloop , and the
Magdalen Schooner	ORGANIZATION	were immediately disembarked , which together with those from the Merchants Vessels , were formed into a Battalion of 9 Companies consisting of near 400 , officers included ー The Officers took Rank in the Marine Batallion respectively , according to their Rank in the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr
Starke	PERSON	being then second Lieutenant of the Lizard , served as a Captain therein , during the Seige ... They proceeded immediately to put the fortifications in the best possible state of defence ; they cleared the ditches and the ramparts , and mounted thereon , with great activity and dispatch , the artillery ; and constructed Barriers in some of the Streets , and other works to strengthen the place .

		While these preparations were carrying into execution , under the direction of Sir
John Hamilton	PERSON	and
Lieut Col Maclean	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Guy Carleton	PERSON	arrived at
Quebec	LOCATION	; after having narrowly escaped from being taken a prisoner , by getting into a Canoe , in which he came down the River from
Montreal	LOCATION	with much hazard , and immediately -LSB- as -RSB- sumed the command of the Garrison 2 ー The British and the Canadian Inhabitants were formed into
Corps of Militia	ORGANIZATION	, which amounted to about 700 Men , which being added to
Lt Col Macleane	ORGANIZATION	's
Corps	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Marine Battalion	ORGANIZATION	, made the whole to consist of about 1200 Men bearing Arms ー 1 .

Washington	LOCATION	Papers , LC .

		`` A FRIEND OF AMERICA '' TO GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	Sir Novr 20 .

		1775 As the present seems the Suitable Season for Endeavouring to procure a Stock of Powder your Excy will indulge a few thoughts on this Important Subject , even though they should not be wholly pertinent .

		I beg leave to propose to your Excy 's Consideration , that a good Schooner , a prime Sailor , should proceed as soon as may be , to Havre de Grace -LRB- in the English Channel -RRB- with a Suitable person on board -LRB- your Agent -RRB- who should Imediately on his arrival there go to
Paris	LOCATION	or
Versailles	LOCATION	, about 120 Miles , with Letters from your Excy to the Prime Minister of
France	LOCATION	, Requesting an Immediate Supply of Ten thousand Barrels -LRB- Quintals -RRB- of Powder , with one hundred Tons of Lead for the Payment of which the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	will make Provision .

		Your Reasons to Induce the French Minister to grant this Supply will so strongly coincide with the
National Politics of France	ORGANIZATION	, it seems highly probable he will be glad of the Opportunity of Supplying or even of giving it , tho ' in some covered way .

		If your Agent Succeeds , he can Easily procure under the Auspices of the French Minister .

		five or Six Vessels , good Sailors , of 100 Tons each , to bring the powder and Lead from
Brest	LOCATION	, or whencesoever the same may be Shipped .

		Each of those Vessels should have a pilot from the Schooner , which for that Purpose should be doubly manned with the best men : your Agent instructing the Masters and Pilots o the sd Vessels how to Conduct on falling in with our Coast .

		ー The Reason for going to Havre de Grace is to have the shortest and directest comunication with the French Minister .

		The same Advantage can not be had so well in
Spain	LOCATION	, as
Madrid	LOCATION	is so distant from the seaports .

		But another Schooner , alike circumstances , might be sent to
Cadiz	LOCATION	, and the business perhaps Negotiated with the Spanish Governor for a like
Quantity of Powder & Lead	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー If not , your Agent might proceed to
Madrid	LOCATION	, about 300 miles , and Settle the Business with the Prime Minister , by whose favour he could Procure at
Cadiz	LOCATION	the Powder & Lead , and Vessels necessary to bring them .

		ー Your Excy will probably think , that your Agents should treat only with the Principals , as Sub-managers are Scarcely to be trusted in so Important a Business .

		ー Two Schooners well fitted manned & c might be happily employed in this manner during the Winter Months .

		ー It might procure the Freight of the Powder on easier Terms if the French and Spanish Vessels were allowed to carry off with them American Produce .

		The Lead would answer for Ballast .

		The Agents should conduct with great circumspection to prevent their Business being even guessed at .

		Should it be known to the English Consul at
Cadiz	LOCATION	, or the Embassador at
Madrid	LOCATION	or
Paris	LOCATION	, or through any other Channel transpire , the Vessels will be stopt ; or taken by English Cruizers , which will be sent to entercept them .

		ー If both applications should Succeed , and the Powder and Lead Arrive in Consequence , the quantity of each will probably be little enough for the ensuing Campaign : as
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	seems to intend it shall be a Vigorous and Extensive one .

		ー ー Your Excy knows whether firearms , Flints or tinplates for making Cartridge boxes , will be wanted .

		The Same Application will probably Procure them .

		ー I have the Honour to be with the most Perfect Regard , Sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB- A Friend to
America	LOCATION	.

		An Estimate of the Cost , according to the best information to be had here , vizt : ー 10000 Quantaels Power a 70s # 35000 Sterg 100 Tons Lead a # 16 1600 500 M Flints best french a 20s 500 37100 The same Quantity 37100 74200 Stg 1 .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO PHILIP
STEPHENS Sir Preston Boston Novr	ORGANIZATION	20 .

		1775 .

		Having in my Letter of the 10th instant only generally acknowledged the Receipt of their Lordships Orders and your Letters by the
Phoenix	LOCATION	, I intend this Letter as a particular Reply to such Parts of either as I think require it .

		Their Lordships directions in your Letter Sepr 5 to land the private Marines from the Ships ordered home , until the private Men of the Battalions ashore are compleated to One thousand Men , shall be punctually obeyed ; but I could have wished their Lordships had directed me to have compleated the Ships first , for , according to the present arrangement , it is probable that the Deficiencies in the Battalions ashore will always require more Privates to compleat than the number of Marines on board the Men of War , who may be sent to
England	LOCATION	.

		Their Lordships are so well acquainted with the use of Marines on board his Majesty 's Ships , and at this time they really are of so much consequence to us , that it is with Reluctance I order them to be landed while the Ships continue short of their Complements .

		I am happy in their Lordships Concurrence with my opinion respecting any Ships or Vessels going to
England	LOCATION	upon the requisition of any Governor of his Majesty 's Colonies : and I have accordingly signified their Lordships directions on that Subject to the Officers under my Command .

		Their Lordship 's indulgence of Potatoes and Carrots will be extremely acceptable to the Officers and Seamen , and I shall most certainly endeavour to get them Turtle , Oranges and such other Refreshments as can be procured in the manner their Lordships have recommended .

		Agreeable to their Lordships directions in your Letter Sepr 6 .

		I have fully considered whether an Hospital Ship would be of Service in the Fleet , to which I beg leave to reply , that I flatter myself
Halifax	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, will in all Events continue in our possession ; and that good accomodation and refreshment may be always procured in each of these Places for the Sick , -LRB- the present time at
Boston	LOCATION	excepted -RRB- : But an Hospital Ship willbe useful to receive Patients afflicted with Epidemical Diseases , or those who can not safely be trusted on Shore , or to move occasionally with the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, and even to be constantly in
Harbour	LOCATION	will , in my opinion , be of considerable Advantage to the Fleet , and in hot Weather be more comfortable to the sick , who are not Scorbuticks , than their being on shore , especially at
Boston	LOCATION	, where I think the situation and size of the present Hospital is ill adapted either for the convenience or health of the Patients ; but at present it can not be enlarged .

		For these Reasons I am of opinion an Hospital Ship will be of Advantage to the Service , and I think the Empress of
Russia	LOCATION	Transport to be the fittest for that purpose of any that are at
Boston	LOCATION	.

		But I submit to their Lordships consideration , whether an Hospital Ship might not be fitted and stored during the Winter in
England	LOCATION	, and be at
Boston	LOCATION	perhaps at the same time -LSB- in the Spring ? -RSB-

		I should be honoured with their determination on that Subject ; and that by so doing she might be well provided with Medicines and necessaries , and every Material for the Accomodation of the sick , which can not be procured here ; and also have skilful Surgeons appointed to her , who being on the Spot would naturally furnish themselves with many very useful Articles this Country does not afford .

		The Falcon ,
Hunter	PERSON	,
Senegal	LOCATION	and Otter Sloops , are without Surgeons Mates ; the rest of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	are compleat .

		The Ships employed within the four
New England	LOCATION	Governments and particularly about
Boston	LOCATION	have by means of their Press Warrants picked up a few Men from their Merchant Ships , in lieu of whom I have generally given some of those belonging to the Ships and Vessels detained .

		We have hitherto avoided as much as possible entering American Seamen on board the King 's Ships , knowing from Experience they will seize every Opportunity of making their Escape , or of assisting their Countrymen in Rebellion .

		I therefore hope we shall be able to compleat the Ships without being obliged to take Americans , or to have men sent purposely from
England	LOCATION	.

		But I shall from time to time put on board the Kings Ships going home as many Americans as can be conveniently carried ; these I would humbly propose to be distributed by their Lordships Order among the Men of War on Home Service , those bound to the
East Indies	LOCATION	or Coast of
Africa	LOCATION	; but on no account to be sent back again to
America	LOCATION	.

		By this means we could in some measure drain the Country of its Seamen , who are generally sober , hardy Fellows , and furnish the Kings Ships with Britons on whom we can have more Reliance at this time than on native Americans .

		I beg leave to observe that by the true construction of their Lordship 's Order dated the 2d of September , no Captain is authorized to detain any Ship or Vessel bound from the Colonies direct to
Great Britain	LOCATION	or his
Majesty 's Islands	LOCATION	in the
West Indies	LOCATION	, or such as are returning from either of these Places to any part of the Continent ; provided their Papers are such as the restraining Acts require : And that this Liberty evidently allows the Rebels to import Salt , Sugar , Melasses , Rum , all kinds of Cloathing ,
Naval Stores	ORGANIZATION	, and many other Articles they greatly stand in Need of , and which , if they are allowed to import , will enable them to carry on the War longer and with more Vigour than if all importation was totally prohibited .

		I can assure their Lordships that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	allow Provisions to be exported only for Arms and Ammunition , and for the Articles I have already enumerated , most of which they are greatly distressed for , and are absolutely requisite to keep their
Army	ORGANIZATION	together .

		I therefore hope their Lordships will approve my deferring to carry the Orders abovementioned into execution , until I am honored with their Lordships further Commands thereon .

		We have had a remarkably wet Autumn , and lately so much blowing Weather , that I fear the Ships coming from
England	LOCATION	will be roughly handled ; and that , the intended Reinforcements arriving so late , very little can be done this Fall .

		I am & c
Sam	PERSON	.

LANDON CARTER	PERSON	My dear Colonel
Philadelphia Novr	PERSON	20 1775 I wrote to Col.
Tayloe	PERSON	two or three days agoe , from whome I suppose you have had the news , and intended by Mr
Colston	PERSON	to answer your last letter ; but an express from the Camp last night having bro ' t fresh intelligence I take the advantage of tomorrow 's post to communicate it to you .

		The transports from
Ireland	LOCATION	with five Regiments compleat have arrived at
Boston	LOCATION	, a fishing boat , with 6 muskets took a schooner belonging to the fleet , loaded with provisions for the officers , in her were many letters by which we learn that the Roman catholic Lords , Bishops , & Gentry are extreamly active in procuring recruits ; The Protestants very averse to the business , many recruiting parties driven out of their towns , and even the lower class of catholics , show great dislike to it , but with the high premiums given by the Popish towns & ca many recruits are raised , & it is expected as many will be raised as will compleat the number intended for the next campaign , which they say is 22,000 .

		5,000 Hanoverians are to garrison Gibralter & portmahon , the british regiments there to go to
England & Ireland	LOCATION	.

		I will not anticipate your reflection upon these infamous proceedings of the Ministry , but I think he must be blind indeed who does not see the design of establishing arbitrary Government in
America	LOCATION	; and unworthy the name of man , who does not oppose it , at all hazards .

		The establishment of Popery , will no doubt , be the reward of the exertions of the Roman catholics .

		We do not think the whole of these raw Irish will make a dinner for our troops , our only fear , is the want of ammunition , but we hope to be releived from that , before next spring our cutters have taken two more of their caitering Vessels one loaded with wood , the other with provisions .

		600 of the enemy made a sally out of
Boston	LOCATION	, to carry off some cattle but a few of our men quickly repulsed them , with the loss of two of their men .

		We have heard of
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's being in

This Colony	ORGANIZATION	of it self is Insigniffecant Compaired with the whole , or some Single Colonys , but Its Communication & situation & c of the Utmost Importance ー We are now Infested with a
Fleet	ORGANIZATION	whose Commander is the most Inhuman of all Mankind 4 he has got Some of the best Pilotes for this

Colony	ORGANIZATION	that they have Contracted Such Genl Acquaintance & knowledge of the
Bay	LOCATION	, that others might never be Able to Acquire As our late Colony Law agst Communicatins with the enemies will prevent it ー I hardly dare Mention it , but by way of Query will do it whether Any thing better Can be done than first , with a
United Force Sufficient	ORGANIZATION	to Come & take all the enemy 's Fleet in this Colony , wch you Must be sensible May be very easily done , wch together would make a
Considerble Maritime	ORGANIZATION	force ー This would give time to throw up some Considerable Fortification which would Enable Our Forces to keep possestion of the Isd of Rhode Isd Agst A much More Formidable Aray than at Prest & profision for the
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	May Soon be thrown in for Many Months ー It would take but few days to Come here & accomplish the Work & procee -LSB- d -RSB- after elsewhere , with the greatest ease .

Persons & Property of his Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's good and faithful Subjects resident therein against certain rebellious Persons who have invaded this Province , a Number of whom have lately appeared in Arms before the Walls of this Town ; and whereas Information has been given me that some Persons resident here Contumaciously refused to enroll their Names in the
Militia Lists	ORGANIZATION	, and to take up Arms in Conjunction with their Fellow Citizens for the Purpose aforesaid , and that others who had enrolled their Names and had for some
Time	ORGANIZATION	carried Arms in the Defence and Preservation of the City have lately laid them down ; and also that some Persons are busy in endeavouring to draw away & alienate the affection of his Majesty 's good & faithful Subjects of this City from his Majesty 's Person and Government ー For these Reasons and in Order to rid the Town of all useless disloyal , & treacherous Persons , I have tho ' t fit to issue this Proclamation ー And I do hereby strictly order and enjoin all and every Person and Persons whatsoever liable to serve in the Militia , and residing at
Quebec	LOCATION	, who have refused or declined to enroll their Names in the
Militia Lists	ORGANIZATION	, and to take up Arms in Conjunction with his Majesty 's good Subjects of this City , and also still refuse or decline so to do , as well as those who having once taken up Arms have afterwards laid them down and will not take them up again , to quit the Town in four Days from the Date hereof , together with their Wives & Children , and to withdraw themselves out of the Limits of the District of Quebec before the first Day of Decr next , under Pain of being treated as Rebels or Spies , if thereafter they shall be found within the said Limits .

		And In as much as the Persons , who in Obedience to this Proclamation are to quit this Town & District , may have bought up a considerable Quantity of the Provisions brought in for the Subsistence of the Inhabitants of the Town ; and it would be imprudent to suffer those Provisions to be carried out , more especially as the Country abounds with the Necessaries of Life , I do hereby further order & en join all and every such Person & Persons to deliver in forthwith to the Honble

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	Sir ー
Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	22 November 1775 I transmit seven private Letters taken on board different Vessels bound to
Jamaica	LOCATION	, which , besides the Intelligence of less moment , prove beyond a doubt what I have mentioned in my Letter of the 20 instant , that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	allow no Exports but in return for Arms , Ammunition , and such other Articles as the Rebels are greatly distressed for to carry on the Rebellion against
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		You will also observe , in one of the Letters inclosed dated
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Sepr 9th that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	have granted a Bounty of # 4 pr hundred Weight on the importation of Gun Powder , with liberty to export the Value of any Quantity thereof in American Produce ; 2 Numbers therefore will become Adventurers while their Vessels can sail under the Sanction of an Act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and the Prospects of Advantage are so disproportioned to the Risque of being taken ; It may not be improper also to remark that the most handy and swift sailing Vessels , with their best Pilots , will be employed on the Business of getting Gun Powder & c. And that the Plan of its being received and accounted for whenever it can be landed almost ensures Success .

		It is needless to hint the Notoriety of American Vessels calling at the French and
Dutch Islands	LOCATION	, notwithstanding the Risque , and taking on board whatever those Islands afford , and they stand in need of : therefore in my humble Opinion nothing but a total Stop at once to all their Commerce can prevent the Rebels procuring Supplies and prolonging the Rebellion .

		The forcing pump made by Mr.

		We had not gone 3 leagues beyond the bay when we saw a frigate and a transport which were waiting for us .

		We judged they were too strong for us & we decided not to approach them and we reversed our course .

		At about 1 o'clock in the afternoon we met Capt Coit commanding an armed schooner and we joined forces in order to try to defeat them ; but we wasted our time for they were three altogether and as they seemed determined to defeat us and make us prisoners , we set our course toward land .

		Capt
Coit	PERSON	proceeded much faster than we did ; a frigate chased us from about three o'clock in the afternoon until the black of night and perhaps well into the night .

		We sailed toward land and dropped anchor three and a half hours after midnight hoping that the next day , the 24th , we would find close to us the frigate which gave us such a good chase the day before , but we only saw

		Resolution of November 1 , 1775 .

		COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	Sr We arrived the 16th in the Evening at
New Winsor	LOCATION	, having been detained .

		part of a day by
Baird	PERSON	, the morning following we rowed down the River about 8 miles to the Fortress in the
Highlands	LOCATION	, where we spent the day in making such Observations as we thought would be of most use to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, & wish our time would have permitted us to render them more perfect without interfering with the other commissions with which we have been honoured .

		We found the fortress in the care of
Messrs -LSB- William -RSB- Bedlow	PERSON	, -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Grenell	PERSON	, & -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Lawrence	PERSON	, whom the Convention of
New York	LOCATION	had appointed Commissioners to superintend the work , wch was carried on under the direction of Mr.
Romans	PERSON	, agreable to his plan presented to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Garrison consisted of one hundred men , being the remainder of two companies from which drafts were made to compleat those that were sent up to the Northward while they continued recruiting ; exclusive of these there were at the fortress 27 Carpenters , 16 Masons , 2 Smiths , and 59 Labourers a Clerk , and a Steward .

		We must own that we found the fort in a less defensible scituation than we had reason to expect , owing chiefly to an injudicious disposition of the labour , which has hitherto been bestowed on the
Barracks	ORGANIZATION	, the Block house , & and the
South West Curtain	LOCATION	, this Mr Romans assured us would be finished in a week , & would mount 14 Cannon ; but when completed , we consider as very insufficient in itself to answer the purpose of defence , tho it is doubtless Necessary to render the whole fortification perfect , but as it is the least useful , we think it should have been last finished ; it does not command the reach to the southward , nor can it injure a Vessel turning the
West	LOCATION	point , & after she has got round , a small breeze or even the tide , will enable a ship to pass the Curtain in a few minutes .

		the principal Strength of the
Fortress	ORGANIZATION	will consist in the
South Bastion	LOCATION	, on which no labour has as yet been bestowed ; a Vessel turning the Point is immediately exposed to its fire , the platform of this will be raised 57 feet above high Water mark , when compleated , which gives it an elevation of about 11 degrees above the guns of a Vessel at the
West	LOCATION	point , supposing she carries them 12 feet above the surface of the Water , according to Mr Romanss Account .

		On this Bastion it is proposed to mount 11 heavy Cannon .

		The block-house is finished , & has 6 4-pounders mounted in it , & is at present the only strength of the fortress , the Barracks Consist of 14 Rooms , each of which may contain 30 men , but they are not yet Compleated for want of Bricks with which to run up the Chimneys .

		The Fortress is unfortunately commanded by all the Grounds about it , & is much exposed to an attack by land ; but the most obvious defect is , that the grounds on the
West	LOCATION	point are higher than the fortress , behind which point an Enemy may land without the least danger : ー in order to render the Port impassable , it seems necessary that this place should be occupied , & batteries thrown up on the opposite shore , where they may be erected with little expence , as the
Earth	LOCATION	is said to be pretty free from stone , this will indeed render our Work very expensive , but we fear nothing short of it will be sufficient to avail us of the winding of the river .

		Mr Romans informs us of a place , about 4 miles lower down the
River	LOCATION	, which is free from the inconveniency we have mentioned & where the elevation is much greater , had we had more time , we should have gone & examined it .

		We would submit to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	whether it may not be proper to send some persons better versed in these matters than we are , to take an accurate survey of the highlands , & to pitch on those spots on which Batterys may be most cheaply expeditiously & advantageously raised .

		We found at the fortress , 8 9 pounders & 6 Carriages Cannon Cartridges 42 6 pounders & 18 Carriages 400 of 9 lb 16 4 pounders & 4 Do 400 of 6 lb 5 3 pounders 88 of 4 lb 101 9 pound Shot 185 lbs of Match 180 6 pound Do 100 lb Muskett Ball 140 4 Do Do 100 lb Grape Shott 43 Double headed 6 lb Shot 170 lb Powder 19 Do 4 lb Do These are all the particulars which our Short Stay at the fort enabled us to collect ー we offer our own sentiments , in matters with which we are so little acquainted with the greatest diffidence , & submitt them implicitly to the Cong -LSB- ress -RSB- but can not help wishing , when we consider the importance of the object , that they would take the opinion of those who are capable of giving them more useful information We congratulate you & the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the happy success of our Arms , & remain -LSB- & c. -RSB-

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES Sir ,
Boston	LOCATION	24th November 1775 .

		By late Advices which I have received from the Earl of
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	, his Lordship informs Me that Measures are pursuing for augmenting the Fleet in
North America	LOCATION	, and that you would be instructed to exert the most vigorous Efforts for suppressing the Rebellion now openly avowed and supported in this Country that the Commanders of His Majesty 's Ships should be directed to receive on Board , and give Protection to any Officers of the Crown , who may be compelled by the Violence of the people to seek for such an Assylum , and to proceed as in the Case of a Town in actual Rebellion against such of the
Sea Port Towns	LOCATION	, being accessible to His Majesty 's Ships , as should offer any Violence to the King 's Officers or in which any Troops should be raised or
Military Works	ORGANIZATION	erected , other than by
His Majesty 's Authority	ORGANIZATION	, or any attempts made to Seize or plunder any public Magazines of Arms and Ammunition .

		After the many communications which I have already had the honor to make to you relative to the Proceedings and transactions of the People in the Province of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	which obliged Me to take refuge here , further Repetitions must at this time be needless to shew how deeolv they are in general unhappily engaged in this unnatural Rebellion ; ー The great advantages which the natural situation of
Piscataqua Harbor	LOCATION	gives to the Rebels having already encouraged them , as I am well informed , to carry their Frenzy to so great a height as to erect several Batteries on different Eminences commanding the River to annoy the King 's Ships , it is very manifest , considering the Spirit prevail ing in the Country , that a strong Force will be necessary to reduce and Hold possession of the
Harbor	LOCATION	; ー Such a Measure however , if effected , would , it is hoped , very much check their presumption , answer other good purposes conformable to His Majesty 's intentions , and probably enable Me to maintain a Residence in the Province to Execute His Majesty 's Commands as far as in my Power .

		Whenever it shall be your pleasure to adopt any plan of proceeding with regard to that Province , as it is My duty so shall it be my most hearty desire to exert every endeavour and Employ every means in my Power to aid and Support all such Operations as you may think proper to undertake for executing His Majesty 's Orders and restoring the Authority of His Government , and be very happy to embark the first Opportunity of going to the Province whenever you think it expedient to send a sufficient Force there to Command Possession of
Piscataqua River	LOCATION	.

Cambridge	LOCATION	Saturday Eveg Novr 25 1775 From my last , you may form some judgment of the disagreeable state of Mind I have suffered from the Commencement of my late misfortunes ー anticipating your approbation , I have so far overcome the restraint I have long labour 'd under , as to attempt again to write you ー my first interview with
Ayscough	PERSON	, after his discovery of the Letters I think worth relating ー -LRB- if I had been subject to fits , I am sure he wou 'd have thrown me into the most violent Convulsions -RRB- ー Oh !

		the damn 'd , black , hellish , bloody Plots contained in these Letters !

		pray Capt Ayscou -LSB- g -RSB- h what do they contain ?

		Oh too shocking to relate !

		treason !

		Rebellion !

		Massacre !

		-LRB- then beating his breast , with the most unnatural distortions of his face & body -RRB- O my God !

		it makes my blood run cold to think on it ー for God 's sake , Capt : Ayscough , if you have any compassion for my feelings , tell me what you mean ー Oh !

		-LRB- beating his breast again -RRB- it chilled the very blood in my veins when I read them .

		there is a plan laid to seize & massacre all the Officers & Friends of Government & all the Churchmen upon the Continent in one Night ー pray Gentlemen is it a fair question , to ask if you are Churchmen ?

		-LRB- Mr
White	PERSON	said he was , I told him I was not -RRB- such cruel , black designs , never before entered the heart of Man ー but Capt : Ayscough are you not mistaken ?

		Of I read -LSB- them -RSB- over & over again ー I am not disposed to question your veracity , but if I had read it myself I would not , believe it .

		ー pray Sir , whose signature do they bear ?

		they are all signed -LSB- '' -RSB-
John Adams	PERSON	. ''

		ー I imagine at this time , he had no thought of their being published , & was determined to make the most of them this may account for the apparent Chagrin & disappointment of our Enemies at
Boston	LOCATION	, upon their appearing in Print .

		they had been taught to believe the most infernal plots woud be disclosed with these Letters , but to their great mortification , were obliged to confess -LRB- to use their own terms -RRB- ー that they were very sensible & consistent , & discovered the author to be a capable determined , finished Politician .

		this had a very good effect upon my Spirits , & I must own I felt no small degree of pride in being the Bearer of them ー poor
Ayscough	PERSON	in the height of his Zeal against your Letters , dropt , or rather bolted out , which I think in justice to his Friend , he ought to have kept Secret ー he said they were acquainted with all the proceedings of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	notwithstanding their fancied security ; & then went on railing at our Members , who he said were pushing matters to extremes against the general opinion of the Body .

		he asserted that upon a motion made by one of the
Adams	PERSON	's , leading to independence , Mr
Randolph	PERSON	the then President , & one of the New York Members , were so much disgusted , that they took their Hats & left the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in resentment ; & that
Randolph	PERSON	was determined not to meet them again .

		ー upon our appearing to doubt the authenticity of his information , he declared he had it from the
New York	LOCATION	member himself he spoke highly in the praises of this Member , & added with a good deal of rancour , that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	were much disunit -LSB- ed -RSB- , -LSB- & -RSB- the appearance of uninimity , which -LSB- was -RSB- all they had been -LSB- able -RSB- to preserve , was owing to the damn 'd -LSB- doubtful , unfair -RSB- management of our Members ー 1 .

		JOURNAL OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS -LSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RSB- Saturday , November 25 , 1775 The
Committee of Claims	ORGANIZATION	reported , that there is due to
Thomas Dewees	PERSON	, for dieting the crew of the ship
Rebecca	PERSON	and
Frances	PERSON	, the sum of # 16.13 ー 44.4 dollars .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	resumed the report of the
Committee on General Washington	ORGANIZATION	's letter , and the same being debated by paragraphs , was agreed to as follows : The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to whom so much of the letter from
General Washington	ORGANIZATION	to the president dated the 8th Instant as relates to the disposal of the vessels and cargoes belonging to the enemy , which shall fall into the hands of or be taken by the inhabitants of the united colonies and so much of the report of the committee of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which lately went to the
Camp	LOCATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	as related to that subject , were referred , have examined the matter thereof and directed the same , as it appears to them , together with the resolutions of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	thereupon to be reported as followeth .

		Whereas , it appears to your
Committee	ORGANIZATION	from undoubted information , that many vessels which had cleared at the respective custom houses in these colonies , agreeable to the regulations established by acts of the British parliament , have in a lawless manner , without even the semblance of just authority , been seized by his majesty 's ships of war , and carried into the harbour of
Boston	LOCATION	and other ports , where they have been riffled of their cargoes , by orders of his majesty 's naval and military officers , there commanding , without the said vessels having been proceeded against by any form of trial and without the charge of having offended against any law .

		It further appears to your Committee that orders have been issued in his majesty 's name , to the commanders of his ships of war , `` to proceed as in the case of actual rebellion against such of the sea port towns and places being accessible to the king 's ships , in which any troops shall be raised or military works erected , '' under colour of which said orders , the commanders of his majesty 's said ships of war , have already burned and destroyed the flourishing and populous town of
Falmouth	LOCATION	, and have fired upon and much injured several other towns within the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, and dispersed at a late season of the year , hundreds of helpless women and children , with a savage hope that those may perish under the approaching rigours of the season , who may chance to escape destruction from fire and sword , a mode of warfare long exploded amongst civilized nations .

		It also appears to your Committee , that the good people of these colonies , sensibly affected by the destruction of their property , and other unprovoked injuries , have at last determined to prevent as much as possible a repetition thereof , and to procure some reparation for the same , by fitting out armed vessels and ships of force .

		In the execution of which commendable designs , it is possible that those who have not been instrumental in the unwarrantable violences abovementioned may suffer , unless some laws be made to regulate , and tribunals erected competent to determine the propriety of captures : Thereupon your Committee came to the following resolutions : 1 .

		That all such ships of war , frigates , sloops , cutters , and armed vessels as are or shall be employed in the present cruel and unjust war against the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, and shall fall into the hands of , or be taken by the inhabitants thereof , be seized and forfeited to , and for the purposes hereinafter mentioned .

		2 .

		That all transport vessels in the same service , having on board any troops , arms , ammunition , cloathing , provisions , or military or naval stores , of what kind soever , and all vessels to whomsoever belonging , that shall be employed in carrying provisions or other necessaries to the British army or armies , or navy , that now are or shall hereafter be within any of the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, shall be liable to seizure , but that the said cargoes only be liable to forfeiture and confiscation , unless the said vessels so employed belong to an inhabitant or inhabitants of these
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	; in which case the said vessel or vessels , together with her or their cargo , shall be liable to confiscation .

		3 .

		That no master or commander of any vessel shall be intitled to cruize for , or make prize of any vessel or cargo before he shall have obtained a commission from the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, or from such person or persons as shall be for that purpose appointed in some one of the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	.

		4 .

		That it be and is hereby recommended to the several legislatures in the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, as soon as possible , to erect courts of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, or give jurisdiction to the courts now in being for the purpose of determining concerning the captures to be made as aforesaid , and to provide that all trials in such case be had by a jury under such qualifications , as to the respective legislatures shall seem expedient .

		5 .

		That all prosecutions shall be commenced in the court of that colony in which the captures shall be made , but if no such court be at that time erected in the said colony , or if the capture be made on open sea , then the prosecution shall be in the court of such colony as the captor may find most convenient , provided that nothing contained in this resolution shall be construed so as to enable the captor to remove his prize from any colony competent to determine concerning the seizure , after he shall have carried the vessel so seized within any harbour of the same .

		6 .

		That in all cases an appeal shall be allowed to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, or such person or persons as they shall appoint for the trial of appeals , provided the appeal be demanded within five days after definitive sentence , and such appeal be lodged with the secretary of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	within forty days afterwards , and provided the party appealing shall give security to prosecute the said appeal to effect , and in case of the death of the secretary during the recess of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, then the said appeal to be lodged in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	within 20 days after the meeting thereof .

		7 .

		That when any vessel or vessels shall be fitted out at the expence of any private person or persons , then the captures made shall be to the use of the owner or owners of the said vessel or vessels ; that where the vessels employed in the capture shall be fitted out at the expence of any of the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, then one-third of the prize taken shall be to the use of the captors , and the remaining two-thirds to the use of the said colony , and where the vessels so employed shall be fitted out at the continental charge , then one-third shall go to the captors , and the remaining two-thirds to the use of the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	; provided , nevertheless , that if the capture be a vessel of war , then the captors shall be intitled to one-half of the value , and the remainder shall go to the colony or continent as the case may be , the necessary charges of condemnation of all prizes , being deducted before any distribution -LSB- is -RSB- made .

		2 8 .

		That the captures heretofore made by vessels fitted out at the continental charge were justifiable , and that the distribution of the captor 's share of the prizes by
General Washington	ORGANIZATION	, be confirmed , which is as follows : That the share allowed to the captors be divided among the officers and men in the following proportions , viz : Captain or commander , 6 shares .

		Mate , 1 1/2 shares .

		First lieutenant , 5 do .

		Gunner , 1 1/2 do .

JAMES SULLIVAN	PERSON	TO A COMMITTEE OF THE MASSACHUSETTS COUNCIL Sir :
Falmouth	LOCATION	, November 26 , 1775 .

		Some time ago I troubled the honourable Board with two letters , wherein I aimed to treat of matters which I thought to be of great importance to the Continent in general , and this Colony in particular , but fearing that a further proceeding in that way might by them be deemed assuming and affrontive , and supposing that the benevolent disposition of your mind , would at the same time it pardons my intruding a long letter on you will induce you to lay such parts of it before the honourable Council , as will have a pertinent tendency to urge them to take under their consideration the importance of preventing the enemies gaining a camp there .

		But previous to my treating of the importance of holding this place , and as evidence to support me therein , I beg leave to give you a history of what has been done here since
Falmouth	LOCATION	was destroyed .

		Soon after
Commodore Mowat	PERSON	, who burnt the town , had sailed for
Boston	LOCATION	, Captain
Symons	PERSON	, in the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	, arrived here , and demanded twenty sheep , two tons of hay , and twenty bushels of potatoes , as a reward for his sparing the few remaining houses ; these were denied him by the people , and an alarm spread that he was going to land four hundred men ; at the same time the people concluded that the Ministerial army designed to take possession of an eminence on the peninsula of
Falmouth-Neck	LOCATION	, for reasons and purposes which I shall hereafter mention to you , and apprehended that those houses which were spared in the conflagration , were intended for barracks , to which belief they were more especially led by Captain
Mowat	PERSON	's telling a person , that he was sorry so many houses were burnt , as the saving more would have better answered his design ; but the people still supposed that if the landing those troops were impeded by the Militia , they would endeavour to burn those houses also ; this alarm spread into the
County of York	LOCATION	, with as much terrour as in the County of
Cumberland	LOCATION	.

		I , therefore , went with a number of men to contrive , if possible , some method to prevent the expected devastation in this part of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	; when I came to
Falmouth	LOCATION	, there were one hundred and eighty men there , including the sea-coast men -LRB- many had gone away for want of provisions , -RRB- the Militia there was commanded by Colonel -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Mitchell	PERSON	, and Colonel
-LSB- Reuben	PERSON	-RSB-
Fogg	PERSON	; and a number of gentlemen were attending .

		They assembled , and chose me to lead them ; an office the honour whereof I was as little ambitious of , as I was capable to well execute it ; however , it being thought to be a post of danger , and as that modesty and diffidence which strongly urged me to decline it , might have been deemed cowardice , and tended to the discouragement of the people , I accepted it , and instantly determined to break ground on an eminence on the Neck , which overlooks the land for twenty miles round ; but as Captain
Symons	PERSON	had sent a proclamation on shore , that if we went to erect any fortification he would fire upon us , I thought he might annoy the people ; and finding that there was then in town three hundred weight of powder , besides the small stocks in the adjacent towns , and two good double-fortified six-pounders , tolerably well mounted , I ordered the people in the night to throw up a battery on an advantageous point , near the ship , in order to combat her if she fired on the people , who were to intrench on the eminence .

		The zeal and resolution with which the people set about the execution of this plan was much beyond my expectation , but just as we drew to the designed place , the Cerberus , though in the dark , weighed anchor , and put to sea , but apprehending that she might return the next morning , we continued our labour all night ; but she has not returned .

		On the 7th instant , the
Convention of Committees	ORGANIZATION	of this County met , and though their proceedings may want some accuracies , yet the spirit obvious in them does honour to the County ; and I , therefore , take the liberty of enclosing a copy of them .

		Since that time we have erected two batteries , cannon-proof , one bearing two double fortified six , and two ditto nine-pounders , and one three-pounder ; and the other battery bears four double fortified long nine-pounders ; all which , except the six-pounders , have been mounted since I came here , and we have gratefully received some guns and powder from the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		Upon the eminence we have got a fort in great forwardness , and should before now have completed the parapet of it , had not the severity of the weather prevented us .

		This is all done by the Militia of these two Counties , with some assistance from the sea-coast men .

		The
Militia	ORGANIZATION	readily attended with their provisions , tools , & c. There is still wanted a redoubt or two , and other advanced works , on the hill , which , with finishing the citadel , must be dderred until the weather is more favourable .

		We much rejoice at the appointment of General
Frye	PERSON	, who arrived here yesterday , and have the highest expectation , from his acknowledged ability and integrity , provided he was in such a situation as would render him active ; but I am sorry to say that the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	has commanded him to fight with his hands bound .

		In his appointment over the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	, he is confined to the County of
Cumberland	LOCATION	, and all his operations are limited to that place , while the
County of York	ORGANIZATION	are as much interested in , and anxiously concerned for the defence of
Falmouth-Neck	LOCATION	, as the County of
Cumberland	LOCATION	.

		This seems an effectual bar to that union of the Counties , which , at this time , is so absolutely necessary ; he , therefore , should have been , and I hope yet will be appointed Major-General of the Militia in these two , if not in the lower
County	LOCATION	.

		And when this is done , unless the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	is organized , as I hope soon it will be , he had as good try to command the sea , as them in time of action .

		In his other department , as commander of two hundred and fifty sea-coast men , whose time expires within one month , he can do nothing to the purpose , but if there should four hundred marines be landed , must fall a sacrifice , before any considerable number of our scattering Militia could be collected to reinforce him .

		Besides this , when he calls the Militia , -LRB- and if they should obey him , -RRB- he has no way to find them provision , or any authority to provide one single necessary for his formidable army of two hundred and fifty men .

		This is the situation of this honourable gentleman , which I should not have mentioned , if I had not the honour to belong to the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now , sir , what remains , is to show you why I apprehend that there is danger of the enemy 's taking this post , and what I supposed to be a rational plan to prevent so great a calamity ; but I must beg your pardon for this prolixity , which is not occasioned by the love of writing , but by the regard I have for the people , and the cause they are engaged in .

		This is undoubtedly one of the best harbours in the Continent , and the only one for the space of two hundred miles , between
Boston	LOCATION	and
Sheepscut	LOCATION	, where a ship can now lie in safety in the winter , and could they be kept out of this harbour , our privateers might cruise in safety ; but if they hold this post , our navigation is at an end , and famine is the consequence .

		If an army of fifteen hundred men should be lodged on the eminence before mentioned , with a proper train , ten thousand would not force their lines ; and as provision for our sustenance can not be raised here , we must come to them for bread ; and where there is no army , or command , the slaughter of a few persons will bring many to submission .

		This observation I take to be founded in human nature ; and it is in vain for people to talk of dying rather than submitting , for when we are famished , overpowered , or disarmed , we must submit , and are criminal in not doing it ; and an entire submission of these Counties when the enemies are possessed of this ground , can be prevented only in three ways , to wit : by forcing their lines , destroying their navy , or watching their motions , with an army much superior in numbers to theirs .

		If the importance of these Counties are held as trifling by our Assembly , -LRB- as I am sensible they are not -RRB- they will be so with the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and the possession of them by our enemies will make a vast odds in the war ; for , beside the distress of the people here , the Ministerial army will be able to furnish the West-Indies with lumber , their several detachments with beef , wood , greens , roots , & c. , & c. , and the
Tories	ORGANIZATION	now starving in
Boston	LOCATION	, with comfortable dwellings and farms .

		These things appear to me to be a sufficient inducement to the Regulars , while they can gain and hold so important a post with a thousand men , to do it ; and if they do , we must inevitably submit , or carry famine with us to the westward of Merrimack-River .

		This can never be prevented but by an expence which ought to , and I doubt not will be borne by the Continent .

		It would be cruel to expect the Militia , either to complete or defend the works begun , for in a small space of time after a fleet appears in sight , with a good wind , the soldiers may be landed and formed , and the assembling a body of the Militia in this country , where the inhabitants are scattering , is a work of time ; and therefore , the most rational plan in my mind is the having a garrison of one thousand men here , under General
Frye	PERSON	, and the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	in these three Counties , organized in small regiments and companies , under his command , and then I dare be answerable for his success .

		This expense may be lightened by having no other sea-coast men from
York	LOCATION	to
Kennebeck	LOCATION	, where there is now four hundred , except what the General shall send on scouting parties .

		I am informed that General
Washington	LOCATION	has said , that if the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	would request it , he would send a regiment here ; it is true that as the season now is , there can be little done at fortification , but there must be a vast many pickets got this winter , to enable a thousand men to defend this post in the spring , while the Militia may be gathering to reinforce them , and flat-bottomed boats should be provided to transport the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	over the water here , and in this way General
Frye	PERSON	may employ his forces this winter , so as to be able to receive an attack in the spring .

Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	anchored in
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	; and , as this Ship fell in with the missing
Ordnance Transport	ORGANIZATION	, it may not be improper to insert so much of Captain
Symons Account	PERSON	as relates to her , especially as it will serve to shew the Condition of the Cerberus from one Months Cruise on the Coast so early as November , as all the other cruizing Vessels suffered in proportion and much more when the Frost set in .

		The General having again expressed his Apprehensions for the Safety of the Vessels expected with
Stores	ORGANIZATION	, Provisions and Forage from all Parts , and acquainted the Admiral that it had been reported one Ship had the day before with Difficulty escaped from two Privateers out of
Marblehead	LOCATION	, and therefore proposed for Frigates to be at
Marblehead	LOCATION	and
Cape Anne	LOCATION	, thinking they would there be more serviceable than Cruizers , and further informed the Admiral , that he had intelligence of three armed Vessels being fitted out from
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	, The Hinchinbrook chased a Schooner into
Cape Anne Harbour	LOCATION	and fired 40 Shot at her .

		A Transport had been attacked in the
Bay	LOCATION	about two days ago , and Captain
Parker	PERSON	ordered the Raven to slip and run out to her assistance ; The Empress of

Transport	ORGANIZATION	did the same , and both were so brisk that they arrived time enough to save the Transport , but the Privateer got off .

England	LOCATION	according to the Admirals Directions , but the next day gave him an Order to remain .

		The Commissioner himself also by Letter , notifying his Arrival at
Halifax	LOCATION	on the 1st of November , acquainted the Admiral that finding the Garrison there exceeding weak , and that the Governor had assured him it had only 126 Men fit for Duty , and that a Report prevailed of a large Body of Rebels being marched up the Country -LRB- their destination unknown -RRB- , he had thought fit to detain the
Somerset	LOCATION	and

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAM HOWE Sir
Boston	LOCATION	, November 26 , 1775 .

		Your Excellency can make no request or proposal for the good of his Majestys Service that I will not readily attend to , and heartily assist to carry into execution , whenever there is a Probability of Success .

		Before and since I had the Honour of your Letter , I have been making the most diligent Enquiries about
Marblehead	LOCATION	and
Cape Anne Harbours	LOCATION	.

		At
Marblehead	LOCATION	I am informed the Rebels have a Battery of twelve Guns , two of them 18 Pounders the rest of less Calibre ; they have also partly fortified
Cape Anne	PERSON	.

		Frigates can not be in either , without being expcy , ed to certain destruction : At
Cape Anne	LOCATION	the outer Road is foul , narrow and greatly exposed , and a Ship once into the inner Road can not get out again without a leading Wind ; the Enemy would naturally forbear annoying her while the Wind continued favourable to depart , but the moment it became contrary the worst consequences might be apprehended : nearly the same Danger attends lying at
Marblehead	LOCATION	.

		It is indeed beyond dispute that the Rebels have several small Cruizers in the
Bay	LOCATION	, who have every advantage over the Kings Ships in point of sailing ; and being light Vessels , drawing little Water , the whole Country their Friends , can lie under the Land , and , upon observing a Vessel or two unguarded , dart upon them suddenly , and carry them off even in sight of the King 's Ships .

		All the Vessels now cruizing in the
Bay	LOCATION	, which are the Mercury ,
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	,
Canceaux	PERSON	and Hinchinbrook , have Orders to go into
Cape Anne	LOCATION	and
Marblehead Harbours	ORGANIZATION	, and if possible destroy or cut out every Vessel they find there ; but my late Intelligence from these places gives me no Hope of their succeeding .

		The Advantages your Excellency mentions would undoubtedly result from the Kings Ships being able to lie constantly in
Marblehead	LOCATION	and
Cape Anne Harbours	LOCATION	.

		I therefore humbly propose as the only means of effecting it to destroy both Towns as soon as possible .

		Your Excellency is so much better qualified than I am to judge of the Numbers necessary for such an Expedition that I give my opinion with the greatest Deference ; but I humbly apprehend three hundred Soldiers , with two good Frigates , would seize the battery at
Marblehead	LOCATION	and destroy if not bring away the Guns ; and with a little Assistance from the Artillery bum the Town .

		And I also submit to your Excellency 's consideration whether we could not with a thousand Men seize , and keep Possession of the
Peninsula of Cape Anne	LOCATION	.

		The Harbours would then be Ours .

		I am & c.
Sam	PERSON	.

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Nantasket	ORGANIZATION	26 November 1775 ー The Wind continued to blow at Et and ESE and drove me to the
Southward of Cape Cod	ORGANIZATION	, off which place the 8th instant I saw two Sail , a Brig and a Snow , but from the Badness of the Weather could not board them until next day , when I found the Brig was laden with military Stores , 2 and the Snow * with Coals for
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I immediately sent them Signals and took Charge of them .

		The next day I spoke to a Ship * from
Liverpool	LOCATION	with Coals to whom I gave Signals likewise .

		From the 9th to this day I have made every effort to get them safe into Port , have twice worked up into the
Bay	LOCATION	, and got within five or six Leagues of the Lighthouse , by our Accounts , when the Wind has shifted to the
E.S.E.	ORGANIZATION	and with such Violence that I have been obliged to hawl the Wind and stand out , the weather being too thick to attempt making the Land .

		The Gale on the 10th shifted so suddenly from
ESE	ORGANIZATION	to North that it obliged me to reef the Course and stand out , in doing which the Mainsail splitt from the Reefband upwards , but fortunately went no further .

		The next day it moderated and I joined the Convoy .

		On the 15th having run in with a Southerly Wind , and waiting for Day light to make the Land , as the Day broke the Wind shifted to E.SE again and blew with very great Violence and continued to the 18th .

		We lost Sight of the Convoy on the Night of the Gale , and have not since seen anything of them .

		In endeavouring to clear the Land we splitt a Maintopsail , Fore Course , and Fore Stay Sail : The Foretopmast Stay Sail blew out of the Netting and went all to Pieces before we could save it .

		We have broke the upper part of the Head and several of the Chain Plates .

		The Ship has been strained very much , and is very leaky in her upper Works by carrying Sail .

		A Sea striking under the Counter broke the Rudder Coat , by which means we shipped a great deal of Water in the Gunroom , which has damaged a Quantity of Bread stowed in the Bread Lockers .

		The People from Fatigue and being constantly wet have been very sickly , so we have had but few men who were able to stand the Deck during the bad Weather .

		All our Sails will repair again except the fore-topmast Stay Sail ; but we shall want assistance in doing it .

		Most of our Sails have been destroyed by the Ropes breaking in taking them in , so that the
Expence of Cordage	ORGANIZATION	has been considerable .

		Note * * This Vessel arrived safe .

WILLIAM HOWE Norfolk	PERSON	26th November .

		On Tuesday the 14th of this month Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	with the Detachment of the 14th Regiment that I have the honour to command , and some Volunteers , embarked in boats , & after going up the
Southern	LOCATION	branch of
Elizabeth river	LOCATION	, we landed about day light four or five miles below the
Great-Bridge	LOCATION	with an intention to dislodge a number of men in arms from
North Carolina	LOCATION	, who had taken passession of that pass ; but they thought proper to retire and disperse upon our approach .

		After directions had been given to erect a kind of wooden fort to secure the pass , we proceeded nine or ten miles farther to
Kemp	PERSON	's landing where we were informed there were three or four hundred of the rebels ready to recieve us , under the command of a Colonel
Lawson	PERSON	.

		When we arrived within sight of
Kemps	PERSON	landing our advanced guard was twice fired upon by the rebels , who had concealed themselves in very thick woods on the left of the road , but upon our rushing in among them they were very soon totally routed .

		Their very precipitate flight and the closeness of the woods prevented our giving a much better account of them .

		It is said that some of them ran away even before the firing began .

		However , five of the rebels , that we know of , were killed , two drowned in endeavouring to escape across a creek , and by all accounts a great many of them were wounded .

		ー We had only one Granadier wounded in the knee .

		Colonel
Hutchings	PERSON	and seven of the rebels were taken in the field , and Colonel
Lawson	PERSON	& eight others were taken a day or two after .

		For further particulars in regard to the above mentioned affair , and the consequences of it , I refer your Excellency to the enclosed Newspaper .

		We took possession of this town the 23d Inst and are now busy intrenching ourselves in the best manner we can , as a large body of the Rebels consisting of eight or nine hundred men are within ten or twelve miles of us .

		ー They marched from
Williamsburg	LOCATION	about a fortnight ago with an intention to pillage and burn this town , which however we shall do everything that is possible to prevent , and I flatter myself that our endeavours will be attended with success .

		MAJOR GENERAL
WILLIAM HOWE	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Boston	LOCATION	27th November 1775 No 3 I have the Honor to inform your Lordship , that the
Whitby Transport	ORGANIZATION	from
Cork	PERSON	, with four Companies of the 17th Regiment of Foot , two Transports , having on Board four Companies of the 3d Battalion of the
Royal Regiment of Artillery	ORGANIZATION	, and two Ships with
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	, are safely arrived .

		The Brig
Nancy	PERSON	, with
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	, was spoke to by one of the Kings Cruisers the 15th Instant and is the only Ordnance Store Ship missing , that sailed under the Convoy of the Phoenix Man of War ; but none of the Transports from
Cork	PERSON	with the 17th 27th 28th 46th 55th Regiments , have yet made their Appearance , except the Whitby above mentioned , which occasions some Apprehensions that they have been driven far to the Southward by the violence of the late Northerly Winds .

		It is much to be wished that they were arrived , not only for the Use they may be of , but on account of the advanced Season of the Year , and the Dangers Vessels must run by coming on this coast in the present Situation of Things , without Convoy or Force , and having no friendly Port but this to receive them , while the Rebels Cruisers are ever watchful to take the advantage of their Weakness or Necessities , wherein they have already have been too successful , and will probaibly do more Mischief , unless the Kings Ships can contrive to cut them off .

		A remarkable Instance of daring spirit was shewn on the 25th Instant , within a short Distance of the
Light House	ORGANIZATION	, and within View of His Majesty 's Ships , by a Schooner that had actually taken one , and would have taken two Transports , loaded with Forage , had it not been for the Vigilance of Lieutenant -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB- Bourmaster , of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and Agent of Transports on this Service , who cut his Cables , rescued the Vessel taken , and drove off the Rebel , in an armed
Transport	ORGANIZATION	, stationed for the Protection of the
Light House	ORGANIZATION	.

		2 The
Light House	ORGANIZATION	at the mouth of this
Harbour	LOCATION	, so necessary for the safety of Vessels bound to the Port , is now , I hope , effectually secured , and a Detachment of Troops will be kept there for its future Defence .

		The Lantern is repaired , and was lighted the 23d Instant .

		I beg leave to Remark the great want of Seamen experienced this Summer , for the navigating of Transports , for manning armed Vessels , and Boats on particular Services , and on many other occasions , which induces me to urge the Necessity of sending out Seamen to complete the Transports to their proper Number , a Return whereof is inclosed .

		It is also to be wished that the Kings Ships had their War Establishment , as they would then be able to spare Men for extra Services , and not have the same Reason for Pressing out of the Vessels from
Europe	LOCATION	, and other Parts coming with Supplies for the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	and
Army	ORGANIZATION	, a Practice which mav greatly affect us in future , unless your Lordship shall be pleased to direct that Protections be given to Vessels sailing from
Britain	LOCATION	, and Exemptions to others who may bring such Supplies .

		Before the Departure of General
Gage	PERSON	, an Expedition was concerted by the General and Admiral for the Destruction of
Cape Ann	LOCATION	and
Falmouth	LOCATION	, two
Sea Port Towns	LOCATION	on the Coast to the Eastward , that were distinguished for their opposition to Government .

		The Canceaux and an armed
Transport	ORGANIZATION	, having a small Detachment of Troops on Board , were to execute it ; from Circumstances it was found inexpedient to make an Attack upon
Cape Ann	PERSON	, whereupon they proceeded to
Falmouth	LOCATION	, which Place after giving timely Warning to the Inhabitants for the Removal of themselves and Effects , was destroyed on the 18th of October , burning about five Hundred Houses , fourteen Sea Vessels , taking and destroying several others , without any Loss on our Part .

JOSIAH QUINCY	PERSON	TO GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	May it please your Excellency ,
Braintree Novr	PERSON	27th 1775 .

		Since I was honoured , with your Excellency 's obliging Answer to my Letter of the 31st Ulto , the Question has often occurred to my Mind , whether , Row Gallies might not be as advantageously employed , in the
Harbor of Boston	ORGANIZATION	, as in the
River Delaware	LOCATION	?

		and the more I have thought upon the Subject , the more I am confirmed in the Opinion that they may .

		The Quantities of Provision that , in the Course of the Summer past , have been transported in Whaleboats from
Barnstable	LOCATION	, Sandwich , and
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	, for the use of the Army : The Successful Excursions to the Lighthouse and other
Islands	LOCATION	, by Detachments from the Companies posted to gaurd the Shores , and especially , the numerous Captures by our armed Cruisers , are striking Proofs of the Utility of a well directed
Naval Force	ORGANIZATION	.

		Soon after the Whaleboats were procured ,
Majr Tupper	PERSON	was so sure of the Advantages to be made of them , that he repeatedly said , if he might have the Command of as many of them , as could be conveniently navigated by one hundred Men , with Ammunition and Provision at the publick Charge , he desired no other Reward for himself and Men , than what he could get from the Enemy : ー The Difficulties under which the
Army	ORGANIZATION	then laboured , was , doubtless , the Reason why he was not attended to : ー Could his Terms have been complyed with , the amount of his and his Men 's Wages would , not only have ballanced the Cost of the Boats and Provision , but have been a Saving of some Hundreds to the Publick , besides annoying and weakening the Enemy , and adding to our Strength , in Proportion to the Success of the Enterprizes in which he had engaged : His Men insted of living in Idleness , the Parent of every Vice , would have been in Action , whenever the Wind and Weather permitted , and at the same Time , a more effectual Gaurd to the Inhabitants , than if they had been on Shore ; as the Enemy would have been very cautious of landing , least their Retreat should be cut off .

		Permit me now , Sir !

		to enumerate some Atchievements that may , probably , be made , and some Advantages that , I think must arise , if the same Number of Men , or a greater Number than were this Year appointed , to gaurd the Shores from
Cohasset	LOCATION	, to
Squantum Neck	LOCATION	inclusively , were , the next year to he employed , under brave and experienced Commanders , in Row Gallies judiciously constructed , mann 'd , and armed ; with attendant Whaleboats , built square stem 'd , a swivel Gun fixed in the Bow of each , and to row , each , with eight Oars .

		And , 1 As our Navigation is in a Manner annihilated , the Crews , being Seamen , may be more easily procured , than so many Soldiers , and being collected at a Distance from the Places of their usual Abode , they will not be so likely to desert , may be better disciplined , and kept more steadily to their Duty .

		2 By keeping them as much as possible on ship board , to the Exercise of their Oars and Arms , in sham Engagements , whenever the Weather will permit , they will be preserved from Idleness , and have little or no Opportunity to do Mischief on Shore .

		3 If the Gallies are constructed to row and sail swift , they may take or leave at Pleasure ; and consequently , in light airs of Wind or a Calm , every Cutter , Transport , or Merchantmen , found without Convoy may be easily taken .

		And I am not able to forsee any thing to hinder , their united Efforts making Prize of a 20 Gun Ship when becalmed , especially in the Night , and within the Limits of the Harbour .

		4 Since I began this Letter , I have been attentively considering , the Situation of the Ships of War and Transports now lying in
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	: ー of the Rocks and
Islands	LOCATION	within point blank Shot of them ; and I am not only convinced my Self , but , I am perswaded , upon Inspection , your Excellency wou 'd be also convinced , that a given Number of Row Gallies , with heavy Cannon and brave Commanders , might force them to leave the
Road	LOCATION	, or make a watery Grave for them where they lye .

		ー Be assured , Sir !

		this is not a Chimera .

		5 Were our Enemies forced to abandon
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	, might not the Narrows be immediately stopped , with Machines formed agreeable to the enclosed Draft , or any other esteemed more eligible ?

		ー Should they attempt to prevent it , by fortifying the adjacent
Islands	LOCATION	, they must divide their Force , and consequently , be so much weaker elsewhere .

		6
Were Vessels of superior Force	ORGANIZATION	, to pursue our Row Gallies without the Light house , as they ought never to go far from Shore , they may easily escape into
Cohasset	LOCATION	, or
Scituate	LOCATION	, which are inaccessrble by Vessels of any considerable Draught of Water : If pursued within the Harbor , they may soon run out of Danger into shoal Water , where , shou 'd the Enemy follow they might by runing aground , insted of being Captors become a Prize .

		7 Should your Excellency determine upon fortifying
Nantasket	LOCATION	or any of the
Islands	LOCATION	, every thing necessary for the Purpose , may be shiped on board the Row Gallies , and transported wherever they are wanted , with little or no Hazard of being intercepted by the Enemy .

		Upon the Whole : Permit me Sir , to conclude as I began that , the more I contemplate the Subject , the more I am confirmed in the Opinion , that Row Gallies may be as advantageously employed in the Harbor of
Boston	LOCATION	as in the
River Delaware	LOCATION	: ー If the same Conclusion for the Reasons above assigned , should be the Result of your Excellency 's Deliberations upon the Subject , and you should determine upon building a Number of them ; the sooner the places where they are to be built , are pitched upon ; the Materials collected , and the Tradesmen contracted with , the greater the Probability of their being finished by the Time they are wanted : ー On the contrary : If your Excellency should view the Subject in a different Light , and the Result of your Deliberations upon it should be the reverse of mine ; I am all Submission ; and only beg , that , the Rectitude of niy Intentions may , at least , secure your Excellency 's favourable Opinion of , -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Josiah Quincy	PERSON	P : S : I forgot to observe that some of the Advantages of attendant Whaleboats wou 'd be making sudden Excursions in Calms upon unarmed Vessels ; preventing their Crews from escaping in Boats , and towing the Gallies whenever they wanted Assistance .

		Last Wednesday -LSB- November 22 -RSB- arrived here from

John Lewis	PERSON	, who sometime past sailed from this colony in a small sloop , Capt.
John Wanton	PERSON	, loaded with apples , cyder , & c. bound to
Georgia	LOCATION	; but off
Charlestown	LOCATION	, SouthCarolina , in a fog , they fell in with the Tamer sloop of war , on board of which was Governor
Campbell	PERSON	of
South-Carolina	LOCATION	; who brought Capt. Wanton to , took out some of his apples , & c. told him he was a good prize , and put on board the gunner of fort

Carolina	LOCATION	people took possession of it -RRB- and one .

		hand more , with two chests of arms , and two trunks of pistols and cutlasses , leaving Capt.
Wanton	PERSON	and his men on board , and gave the gunner orders to go to
St. Augustine	LOCATION	for 200 men to come to
South-Carolina	LOCATION	to retake fort
Johnston	PERSON	.

		When they got out of sight of the
Tamer	LOCATION	, Capt.
Wanton	PERSON	and his men shut the gunner down in the hold , carried the vessel into
Georgia	LOCATION	, and informed the committee of that place with their proceedings , who treated them very genteely ; they valued the arms , & c. at 200 # .

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- Tyonderoga Novr 27th 1775 .

		Sir , In my Letter of the 20th instant I observed that about six hundred & fifty or seven hundred Troops raised in
Connecticut	LOCATION	remained in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		I have not had a Return from thence but from the best Information I have been able to procure and from former returns I am convinced they do not exceed two hundred , the in closed
State	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- tho ' imperfect -RRB- will exhibit nearly our Force in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		It may be asked why -LSB-
Seth	PERSON	-RSB-
Wamers Regiment	ORGANIZATION	were suffered to come away & some other of the Troops raised in this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, as the Term for which they were engaged would not expire until the last Day of next Month ?

		The unhappy Cause is this , At
St Johns the Connecticut Troops	ORGANIZATION	were so very importunate to return Home , that General
Montgomery	PERSON	was under the Necessity of promissing , That all those that would follow him to
Montreal	LOCATION	should have Leave to return home this Declaration he could not confine to the
Connecticut	LOCATION	Troops as such a Discrimination would have been Odious .

		ー It might have been expected that Men influenced by a Sense of Liberty would not have required such a Promise , and that Others to whom it was not immediately intended would not have taken the Advantage of It , but all this Flows from the same unhappy Source with the other Disorders too , too prevalent in our Troops , a Want of Subordination & Discipline , an Evil which may prove fatal to Us .

		Few of the Troops now in
Canada	LOCATION	will be able to come Away , until they can cross upon the Ice .

		But as soon as that happens , I believe the greater Part will return ; And should we not be able to possess ourselves of
Quebec	LOCATION	, Which it is probable we will not , if
Colo	PERSON	: Arnold me -LSB- e -RSB- t -LSB- s -RSB- with any Opposition as the Weather has been so excessively severe that No Troops could lay out , the Consequences may be very deplorable , perhaps It may be thought necessary all Circumstances considered to raise three Thousand Men in
Pensylvania	LOCATION	&
New Jersey	LOCATION	& order them to rendezvous with all possible Dispatch at
Albany	LOCATION	to prepare and be ready to march as soon as the Lakes are passeble , Conducted by whatever Officer
Congress	ORGANIZATION	shall appoint to command in that Quarter .

		General
Washington	LOCATION	writes me that he is in very great Want of Powder , Lead , Mortars ,
Cannon & most Sorts of Artillery Stores &	ORGANIZATION	begs that I will send him all that can be spared from this Quarter .

		What
Operations Congress	ORGANIZATION	may intend to carry on this Way , I do not know , & consequently can not determine If any can be spared .

		ー But at present none can be sent , as we must wait until
Lake George	PERSON	is frozen over in Order to transport them , the little Powder here is going to
New York	LOCATION	agreeable to the Order of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lead we have little left , and all the
Ordinance & Military Stores	ORGANIZATION	in
Canada	LOCATION	are either carried off or destroyed by Genl Carlton Except what was taken at
St Johns &	ORGANIZATION	what was sent from hence .

		As the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	seem determined to carry on the War with Spirit , ー Would it not be adviseable as soon as there is good Sledding , to remove all the Prisoners from
Connecticut	LOCATION	to some of the Interior Towns in
Pensyvlenia	LOCATION	, both because It will enable the former
Colony	ORGANIZATION	to oppose more Men , & save the Expence of transporting Provisions from
Hudsons River	LOCATION	for the Supply of the Eastern Armies , Which I think I can foresee must be the Case in the next Campaign .

		27th 2 o'Clock , I have this Moment received a Letter from General
Montgomery	PERSON	, Copy of which I do Myself the Honor to inclose You in a Note of the 20th he advises me that he hoped to proceed towards Quebec the next Day , But complains that the Troops leave him in great Numbers and of the
Green Mountain Boys	ORGANIZATION	especially , who had promised to go down with him .

		I am informed , that all the Vessels in which Mr
Carlton	PERSON	had embarked himself , his Troops & Stores , have surrendered by Capitulation ; That
Carlton Got	PERSON	on Shore & was gone towards
Quebec	LOCATION	I believe It to be true & hope soon to give You authentic Intelligence of It .

		The Schooner & Row Galley taken at
St Johns	LOCATION	are just arrived here together with our Sloop & Schooner full of Prisoners & their Baggage , I am much distress 'd to get them on ,
My Cattle	ORGANIZATION	fairly worn out & only six Horses which I sent for from my own Stables , & the Boats that go from the Landing to
Fort George	LOCATION	, do not return above once in Eight Days from Hence , as I have few Men there and the Troops that are going home , will not by any Means send a few Hands to bring them back , ー 2 1 .

William	PERSON	-RSB- Spry of the Engineers , by order of the General , as the Commissioner was informed : That there had been a great Neglect in providing

		JOURNAL OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS -LSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RSB- Tuesday , November 28 , 1775 The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	resumed the consideration of the rules for the regulation of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	of the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, and the same being debated by paragraphs , were agreed to as follows : Rules for the Regulation of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	of the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	The Commanders of all ships and vessels belonging to the thirteen
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, are strictly required to shew in themselves a good example of honor and virtue to their officers and men , and to be very vigilant in inspecting the behaviour of all such as are under them , and to discountenance and suppress all dissolute , immoral , and disorderly practices , and also such as are contrary to the rules of discipline and obedience , and to correct those who are guilty of the same , according to the usage of the sea .

		The Commanders of the ships of the thirteen
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, are to take care that divine service be performed twice a day on board , and a sermon preached on Sundays , unless bad Weather or other extraordinary accidents prevent it .

		If any shall be heard to swear , curse , or blaspheme the name of God , the Commander is strictly enjoined to punish them for every offence , by causing them to wear a wooden collar , or some other shameful badge of distinction , for so long time as he shall judge proper .

		If he be a commissioned officer , he shall forfeit one shilling for each offence , and a warrant or inferior officer six pence .

		He who is guilty of drunkenness , if a seaman , shall be put in irons until he is sober , but if an officer , he shall forfeit two days ' pay .

		No Commander shall inflict any punishment upon a seaman beyond twelve lashes upon his bare back , with a cat of nine tails ; if the fault shall deserve a greater punishment , he is to apply to the Commander in chief of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, in order to the trying of him by a court martial , and in the mean time , he may put him under confinement .

		The Commander is never by his own authority to discharge a commission or warrant officer , nor to punish or strike him , but he may suspend or confine them , and when he comes in the way of a Commander in Chief , apply to him for holding a court martial .

		The Officer who commands by accident of the Captain 's or commander 's absence -LRB- unless he be absent for a time by leave -RRB- shall not order any correction , but confinement , and upon the captain 's return on board , he shall then give an account of his reasons for so doing .

		The Captain is to cause the articles of war to be hung up in some public places of the ship , and read to the ship 's company once a month .

		Whenever a Captain shall inlist a seaman , he shall take care to enter on his books the time and terms of his entering , in order of his being justly paid .

		The Captain shall , before he sails , make return to , and leave with the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, or such person or persons as the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	shall appoint for that purpose , a compleat list of all his officers and men , with the time and terms of their entering ; and during his cruize shall keep a true account of the desertion or death of any of them , and of the entering of others , and after his cruize , and before any of them are paid off , he shall make return of a compleat list of the same , including those who shall remain on board his ship .

		The men shall , at their request , be furnished with slops that are necessary by the Captain or purser , who shall keep an account of the same , and the Captain , in his return in the last mentioned article directed to be made , shall mention the amount delivered to each man , in order to its being stopped out of his pay .

		As to the term `` inferior Officer , '' the Captain is to take notice that the same does not include any commission or any warrant officer , except the second master , surgeon 's mate , cook , armourer , gun-smith , master at arms , and sail maker .

		The Captain is to take care when any inferior officers or volunteer seamen are turned over into the ship under his command from any other ship , not to rate them on the ship 's books in a worse quality , or lower degree or station , than they served in the ship they were removed from ; and for his guidance he is to demand from the commander of the ship from which they are turned over , a list under his hand , of their names and qualities .

		Any officer , seamen , or others , intitled to wages or prize money , may have the same paid to his assignee , provided the assignment be attested by the Captain or Commander , the master or purser of the ship , or a chief magistrate of some county or corporation .

		The Captain is to discourage the seamen of his ship from selling any part of their wages or shares , and never to attest the letter of attorney of any seaman , until he is fully satisfied that the same is not granted in consideration of money given for the purchase of his wages or shares .

		When any inferior officer or seaman dies , the Captain is forthwith to make out a ticket for the time of his service , and send the same by the first safe conveyance to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, or agents by them for that purpose appointed , in order to the wages being forthwith paid to the executors or administrators of the deceased .

		A convenient place shall be set apart for sick or hurt men , to which they are to be removed , with their hammocks and bedding , when the surgeon shall advise the same to be necessary , and some of the crew shall be appointed to attend and serve them , and to keep the place clean .

		The cooper shall make buckets with covers and cradles , if necessary , for their use .

		All ships furnished with fishing tackle , being in such places where fish is to be had , the Captain is to employ some of the company in fishing ; the fish to be distributed daily to such persons as are sick or upon recovery , provided the surgeon recommend it , and the surplus , by turns amongst the messes of the officers and seamen , without favour or partiality and gratis , without any deduction of their allowance of provisions on that account .

		It is left to the discretion of Commanders of squadrons , to shorten the allowance of provisions according to the exigence of the service , taking care that the men be punctually paid for the same .

		The like power is given to Captains of single ships in cases of absolute necessity .

		If there shall be a want of pork , the Captain is to order three pounds of beef to be issued to the men , in lieu of two pounds of pork .

		One day in every week shall be issued out a proportion of flour and suet , in lieu of beef , for the seamen , but this is not to extend beyond four months ' victualling at one time , nor shall the purser receive any allowance for flour or suet kept longer on board than that time , and there shall be supplied , once a year , a proportion of canvass for pudding-bags , after the rate of one ell for every sixteen men .

		If any ships of the thirteen
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, shall happen to come into port in want of provisions , the warrant of a Commander in chief shall be sufficient to the Agent or other instrument of the victualling , to supply the quantity wanted , and in urgent cases where delay may be hurtful , the warrant of the Captain of the ship shall be of equal effect .

		The Captain is frequently to order the proper officers to inspect into the condition of the provisions , and if the bread proves damp , to have it aired upon the quarter deck or poop , and also examine the flesh casks , and if any of the pickle be leaked out , to have new made and put in , and the casks made tight and secure .

		The Captain or purser shall secure the cloaths , bedding , and other things of such persons as shall die or be killed , to be delivered to their executors or administrators .

		All papers , charter parties , bills of lading , passports , and other writings whatsoever , found on board any ship or ships , which shall be taken , shall be carefully preserved , and the originals sent to the court of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	for maritime affairs , appointed or to be appointed by the legislatures in the respective colonies , for judging concerning such prize or prizes ; and if any person or persons shall wilfully or negligently destroy or suffer to be destroyed , any such paper or papers , he or they so offending , shall forfeit their share of such prize or prizes , and suffer such other punishment , as they shall be judged by a court-martial to deserve .

		If any person or persons shall embezzle , steal , or take away any cables , anchors , sails , or any of the ship 's furniture , or any of the powder , arms , ammunition , or provisions of any ship belonging to the thirteen
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, he or they shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial shall order .

		When in sight of a ship or ships of the enemy , and at such other times as may appear to make it necessary to prepare for an engagement , the Captain shall order all things in his ship in a proper posture for fight , and shall , in his own person , and according to his duty , heart on and encourage the inferior officers and men to fight courageously , and not to behave themselves faintly or cry for quarters , on pain of such punishment as the offence shall appear to deserve for his neglect .

		Any Captain or other officer , mariner , or others , who shall basely desert their duty or station in the ship , and run away while the enemy is in sight , or , in time of action , or shall entice others to do so , shall suffer death , or such other punishment as a court-martial shall inflict .

		Any officer , seaman , or marine , who shall begin , excite , cause , or join in any mutiny or sedition in the ship to which he belongs , on any pretence whatsoever , shall suffer death , or such other punishment as a court-martial shall direct .

		Any person in or belonging to the ship , who shall utter any words of sedition and mutiny , or endeavour to make any mutinous assemblies on any pretence whatsoever , shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial shall inflict .

		None shall presume to quarrel with or strike his superior officer , on pain of such punishment as a court-martial shall order to be inflicted : If any person shall apprehend he has just cause of complaint , he shall quietly and decently make the same known to his superior officer , or to the captain , as the case may require , who will take care that justice be done him .

		There shall be no quarrelling or fighting between shipmates on board any ship belonging to the thirteen
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, nor shall there be used any reproachful or provoking speeches , tending to make quarrels and disturbance , on pain of imprisonment , and such other punishment , as a court-martial shall think proper to inflict .

		If any person shall sleep upon his watch , or negligently perform the duty which shall be enjoined him to do , or forsake his station , he shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial shall judge proper to inflict , according to the nature of his offence .

		All murder shall be punished with death .

		All robbery and theft shall be punished at the discretion of a court martial .

		Any master at arms who shall refuse to receive such prisoner or prisoners , as shall be committed to his charge , or having received them , shall suffer him or them to escape , or dismiss them without orders for so doing , shall suffer in his or their stead , as a court-martial shall order and direct .

		The Captain , officers , and others , shall use their utmost endeavours to detect , apprehend , and bring to punishment , all offenders , and shall at all times readily assist the officers appointed for that purpose in the discharge of their duty , on pain of being proceeded against , and punished by a court-martial at discretion .

		All other faults , disorders , and misdemeanors , which shall be committed on board any ship belonging to the thirteen
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, and which are not herein mentioned , shall be punished according to the laws and customs in such cases at sea .

		A court-martial shall consist of at least three Captains and three first lieutenants , with three Captains and three first lieutenants of Marines , if there shall be so many of the
Marines	ORGANIZATION	then present , and the eldest Captain shall preside .

		All sea officers of the same denomination shall take rank of the officers of the marmes .

		Every Member of a court-martial shall take the following oath , viz : `` You swear that you will well and truly try , and impartially determine the cause of the prisoner now to be tried , according to the rules of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	of the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	.

		So help you God : '' which oath shall be administered by the president to the other members , and the president shall himself be sworn by the officer in said court next in rank .

		All witnesses , before they may be admitted to give evidence , shall take the following oath : `` You swear the evidence you shall give , in the cause now in hearing , shall be the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth .

		So help you God . ''

		The sentence of a court-martial for any capital offence , shall not be put in execution , until it be confirmed by the Commander in chief of the fleet ; and it shall be the duty of the president of every court-martial , to transmit to the Commander in chief of the fleet , every sentence which shall be given , with a summary of the evidence and proceedings thereon , by the first opportunity .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	resumed the Consideration of the Rules and Orders for the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	of the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, and the same being debated by Paragraphs were agreed to ... They were drawn up in the
Marine Committee	ORGANIZATION	and by my hand , but examined , discussed , and corrected by the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this place I will take the Opportunity to observe , that the pleasantest part of my Labours for the four Years I spent in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	from 1774 to 1778 -LSB- i.e. 1777 -RSB- was in this naval Committee .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	, Mr.
Gadsden	PERSON	, were sensible Men , and very chearful ; But Governor
Hopkins	PERSON	of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, above seventy Years of Age kept us all alive .

		Upon Business his Experience and Judgment were very Usefull .

		But when the Business of the Evening was over , he kept Us in Conversation till Eleven and sometimes twelve OClock .

		His Custom was to drink nothing all day nor till Eight OClock , in the Evening , and then his
Beveredge	LOCATION	was
Jamaica Spirit	ORGANIZATION	and Water .

		It gave him Wit , Humour , Anecdotes , Science and Learning .

		He had read Greek , Roman and British History : and was familiar with English Poetry particularly
Pope	PERSON	,
Tompson -LSB- Thomson	PERSON	-RSB- and
Milton	PERSON	.

		And the flow of his Soul made all his reading our own , and seemed to bring to recollection in all of Us all We had ever read .

		I could neither eat nor drink in those days .

		The other Gentlemen were very temperate .


Hopkins	PERSON	never drank to excess , but all he drank was immediately not only converted into Wit , Sense .

		Knowledge and good humour , but inspired Us all with similar qualities .

Philadelphia	LOCATION	, November 28 , 1775 -RSB- 2 Our River is well secured by a Cheval de Frise sunk about eight Miles below our Town , with a small Aperature for our own Vessels to pass thro ' , which they generally can do with the Assistance of a good Pilot who knows the Situation of this Machine or Instrument of
Defence	ORGANIZATION	; altho ' we have already lost two small Vessels in attempting to pass it , even with good Pilots on Board .

		None of the
Lewistown	LOCATION	Pilots are suffered to come up higher than
Chester	PERSON	, nor to go on board of any Vessel at
Lewis Town	LOCATION	without Application first made to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	there : There are other Pilots stationed at
Chester	LOCATION	to bring up the Vessels thro the Cheval de Frise .

		And we have 13 Gondaloes with a large Cannon of 24 to 48 Prs with Men , on board to guard this Pass , so that it will be very difficult for a Man of War to come up to Town .

		I have it in my power to acquaint you that the successes of our arms have corresponded with the justice of our cause .


Chambly	LOCATION	and St.
John	PERSON	's have been taken some weeks ago , and in them the whole regular army in
Canada	LOCATION	except about 40 .

		or 50 .

		men .

		This day we receive certain intelligence that our General
Montgomery	PERSON	is received into
Montreal	LOCATION	: and expect every hour to be informed that
Quebec	LOCATION	has opened it 's arms to
Colo.	LOCATION	.

		Arnold who with 1100 men was sent from
Boston	LOCATION	up the
Kennebec	LOCATION	and down the
Chaudiere	LOCATION	river to that place .

		He expected to be there early this month .


Montreal	LOCATION	acceded to us on the 13th .

		and
Carleton	PERSON	set out with the shattered remain -LSB- s -RSB- of his little army for
Quebec	LOCATION	where we hope he will be taken up by
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a short time we have reason to hope the delegates of
Canada	LOCATION	will join us in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and complete the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	as far as we wish to have it completed .

		We hear that one of the British transports is arrived at
Boston	LOCATION	, the rest are beating off the coast in very bad weather .

		You will have heard before this reaches you that Ld .


Dunmore	PERSON	has commenced hostilities in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		That people bore with every thing till he attempted to bum the town of
Hampton	LOCATION	.

		They opposed and repelled him with considerable loss on his side and none on ours .

		It has raised our country into perfect phrensy .

		It is an immense misfortune to the whole empire to have a king of such a disposition at such a time .

		We are told and every thing proves it true that he is the bitterest enemy we have .

		His minister is able , and that satisfies me that ignorance or wickedness somewhere controuls him .

		In an earlier part of this contest our petitions told him that from our king there was but one appeal .

		The admonition was despised and that appeal forced on us .

		To undo his empire he has but one truth more to learn , that after colonies have drawn the sword there is but one step more they can take .

		That step is now pressed upon us by the measures adopted as if they were afraid we would not take it .

		Beleive me Dear Sir there is not in the British empire a man who more cordially loves a Union with Gr .


Britain	LOCATION	than I do .

		But by the god that made me I will cease to exist before I yeild to a connection on such terms as the British parliament propose and in this I think I speak the sentiments of
America	LOCATION	.

		We want neither inducement nor power to declare and assert a separation .

		It is will alone which is wanting and that is growing apace under the fostering hand of our king .

		One bloody campaign will probably decide everlastingly our future course ; I am sorry to find a bloody campaign is decided on .

		If our winds and waters should not combine to rescue their shores from slavery , and General
Howe	PERSON	's reinforcement should arrive in safety we have hopes he will be inspirited to come out of
Boston	LOCATION	and take another drubbing : and we must drub you soundly before the sceptered tyrant will know we are not mere brutes , to crouch under his hand and kiss the rod with which he deigns to scourge us .

London	LOCATION	, by Capt.
Manley	PERSON	, contents as per the enclosed copy , -LRB- taken by Mr.

		He unluckily miss 'd the greatest prize in the world ; their whole ordinance , the ship containing it being just ahead , but he could not have got both ; and we must be thankful , as I truly am , for this instance of Divine favour ; for nothing surely ever came more apropos ; that no part of it may slip through my fingers , -LRB- for I have no doubt as this capture was made in sight of the other vessel , of there being some bold push to recover it -RRB- I instantly upon receiving the account , ordered four companies down to protect the stores ; teams to be impress 'd , to remove them without delay ; and Col.
Glover	PERSON	to assemble the minute men in the neighbourhood of

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO CAPTAIN
HENRY BELLEW	PERSON	,
R.N. Sir Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	30 Novr 1775 By Captain
Tollemache	PERSON	, who sailed from hence in his Majesty 's Sloop Scorpion the latter end of August , I sent Orders to Captain
Thornborough	PERSON	of the Tamer to repair immediately to
North Carolina	LOCATION	, and having assisted Captain
-LSB- Francis -RSB- Parry	PERSON	of the Cruizer to dismantle Fort
Johnston	PERSON	and put the
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	on board a Transport , which Captain
Tollemache	PERSON	carried with him for that purpose , to come to
Boston	LOCATION	and leave Captain
Tollemache	PERSON	at
Cape Fear	LOCATION	.

		But , as I have not since heard from either of the Captains , I am apprehensive the Scorpion thro ' some Accident is not arrived at
Carolina	LOCATION	.

		I therefore suppose that agreeably totheir Lordships Order to you of the 31st of August 1775 -LRB- a Copy of which I have received . -RRB-

		you have sent the Tamer to
Savannah	LOCATION	in
Georgia	LOCATION	, one of the Sloops that was at
Virginia	LOCATION	to
Charles Town	LOCATION	, and that this wiH find you at
Virginia	LOCATION	, where I think it would be most proper for you to remain .

		However if through any accident no senior Officer to yourself arrives at
Virginia	LOCATION	, I desire the Tamer and
Cruizer	PERSON	may be sent to
Boston	LOCATION	as soon in the Spring as the Weather will admit .

		I have ordered Captain
Stanhope	PERSON	to go to
Savannah	LOCATION	, lest no Sloop should be there , but upon his Arrival you will dispose of him as you judge best for the Service , after his Dispatches are delivered .

		And I recommend it to your Consideration whether it would not be right to let two Sloops be at
Charles Town	PERSON	, for I think one there is not sufficient .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO PHILIP STEPHENS Sir
Preston	PERSON	,
Boston	ORGANIZATION	30 Novr 1775 , Upon the Arrival of the
Phoenix	LOCATION	in
Nantasket Road	LOCATION	the 9th instant I directed Captain
Parker	PERSON	to remain there to repair the damage he had suffered on his passage from
England	LOCATION	, and to compleat his Provisions to six Months , in Order to releive the
Asia	LOCATION	at
New York	LOCATION	.

		The
Phoenix	LOCATION	was ready the 20th but contrary Winds kept her in the Road until the 27th when she sailed in fine settled Weather .

		By the Viper who sailed the 17th for
New York	LOCATION	I apprized Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	that the
Phoenix	LOCATION	was coming to relieve the
Asia	LOCATION	, and directed him to commit to Writing such Intelligence as he had collected of the operations and designs of the Rebels , the Navigation of the Rivers particularly
Hudsons River	LOCATION	, and any other information necessary to leave with his Successor , and to retain as many good Pilots as could be procured ; so that I hope the
Asia	LOCATION	will sail for
England	LOCATION	in a very few days after the Arrival of the
Phoenix	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Parker	PERSON	has Orders to take the
Asia	LOCATION	's private Marines on board the
Phoenix	LOCATION	, until they can be sent to
Boston	LOCATION	and join the Battalions on shore .

		I have had so many contradictory Accounts of the probability of a large Ship lying during the Winter in the River without going along side a Wharf that I have left it to Captain
Parker	PERSON	's discretion -LRB- who has wintered there -RRB- where to place his Ship while the Ice runs , but I have ordered him to anchor before the City whenever the
River	LOCATION	is clear ; and having six months Provisions on board and the Viper with him , whatever turn things may take in the City , before the Navigation to it is open , I think Captain
Parker	PERSON	can not be distressed .

		In one of my former Letters mention is made of my intent -LSB- ion -RSB- to send the Nautilus with Lord
Dartmouths	PERSON	Dispatches for the Governors of his Majesty 's Colonies to the Southward , and that I had given Captain Collim Leave to be on shore for the
Recovery of his Health	ORGANIZATION	while the Sloop was fitting .

		About the 16th she was ready , but Captain
Collins	PERSON	, unable to take upon himself the Command , begged my further Indulgence of Leave , and finding him from the Surgeon 's Report to be utterly incapable of doing his Duty , I granted him leave to remain on Shore , and gave an Order to Lieut.
John Graves of the Preston	PERSON	to command the
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	, and sent him to cruize in
Boston Bay	LOCATION	.

		I also directed Captain
Stanhope	PERSON	of his Majesty 's
Sloop Raven	PERSON	to compleat his provisions immediately to six months in order to proceed with the Dispatches instead of the Nautilus ; which being done Captain
Stanhope	PERSON	sailed this day .

		I inclose Copies of Captain
Collins	PERSON	's Letters and the Surgeon 's Report .

		Captain
Stanhope	PERSON	is to touch at
Newcastle	LOCATION	on the
Delaware	LOCATION	, at
Virginia	LOCATION	,
North Carolina	LOCATION	, and at
Savannah	LOCATION	in
Georgia	LOCATION	, where I have directed him to remain until farther Order , expecting the Tamer and
Cruizer	PERSON	to be on their passage to
Boston	LOCATION	: But lest that should not be the Case , through any unforseen Accident , I have given directions to Captain
Bellew	PERSON	of his Majesty 's
Ship Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	, in a Letter dated this day , a Copy of which is inclosed that you may be thoroughly informed what force we have at present to the Southward of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The Tartar arrived the 24th from the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	with part of her Convoy of Transports laden with Forage , one of which , the
Jupiter	LOCATION	, full of
Hay	PERSON	commanded by Lieutenant
Dickenson	PERSON	the Agent , was set on fire by Lightning in
Boston Bay	LOCATION	on the 29th instant and entirely consumed ; His Majesty 's Ship Mercury happened fortunately to be near and saved all the Peop ` le except Col. Day a Gentleman of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, and a firm Friend to Government , who was drowned The 26 the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	arrived from a
Cruize	LOCATION	having suffered greatly by the turbulent Weather she met with .

		Captain
Symons	PERSON	acquaints me he ran ashore on the Whales Back near
Piscatagua	LOCATION	, and , since he came in , got upon the
Centurion Rock	LOCATION	in this
Harbour	LOCATION	, so that I shall be obliged to have the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	's bottom looked at before she can proceed to Sea again .

		This I purpose doing here and that the Ships shall hawl alongside , and put out their Guns , Cables and heavy Stores on
Hancocks Wharf	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Falcon hath been already graved , and I intend to clean some of the Frigates , 20 Gun Ships and Sloops , whose Bottoms do not want caulking , that they may be ready for Service early in the Spring .

		As the Master of his Majesty 's Ship Preston , whom I ordered to act as Master Attendant at
Halifax	LOCATION	, is superseded and returned to his Ship , I have given him an Order to act as Master Attendant at
Boston	LOCATION	with the same allowance of five Shillings sterling p Day as he had at
Halifax	LOCATION	; This Officer is and will be much wanted here and I hope their Lordships will approve my appointing Mr
Holman	PERSON	, who is an exceeding good Man and well qualified for the
Office	ORGANIZATION	; And , having a Naval Officer also , the business of the Port will now be carried on I hope with nearly the same regularity and
Dispatch	ORGANIZATION	used in the Kings Yards at home .

		The Lively being compleated with Stores and Provisions is gone to
Nantasket	LOCATION	, and I have ordered the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	to come up .

		General
Howe	PERSON	has fortified the Light house at the entrance of
Boston Harbour	LOCATION	, and a light is now shewn as before .

		While the Workmen were employed , sometimes an armed Transport and sometimes a Man of War received them on board at Night and protected them until the Building was capable of being defended by a
Party of Soldiers	ORGANIZATION	stationed for that purpose .

		The
Nancy Brig	PERSON	laden with
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	; which came out under Convoy of the
Phoenix	LOCATION	, is not yet arrived although she has been near three weeks on the
Coast	LOCATION	, and has been successively under Convoy of the Cerberus and Mercury , but from Gales of Wind and thick Weather could not get in .

		His Majesty 's
Ship Fowey	PERSON	anchored at
Nantasket	LOCATION	from
Halifax	LOCATION	the 26th instant , and by my Order Captain
Parker	PERSON	directed her immediately to cruize in the
Bay	LOCATION	; and she sailed again the 28th Being in daily expectation of the Arrival of some of the Frigates , and knowing their Lordship 's earnest desire to have the great Ships home , I have determined to let the
Boyne	LOCATION	return , and Captain
Hartwell	PERSON	will accordingly sail the 4th of next month for
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	.

		He carries home all our Invalids , together with a Number of American Seamen , whom I have ordered to be borne on a supernumerary List for Wages and Victuals , and as I have directed Captain
Hartwell	PERSON	to write to you concerning them upon his Arrival I hope their Lordships will be pleased to order them to be distributed , so as they may not serve in any Numbers together in

		Matters are carried on here with a very high hand on both sides ; but before the ensuing spring is at an end , you will hear of a material alteration in the government of
America	LOCATION	.

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has published a declaration of war against the British parliament , and have issued commissions to privateers .

		They took a transport with arms within a mile of one of our ships at anchor ; 2 indeed they are bold enough to dare and do any thing .

		It is a pity the parliament were in such a hurry to stigmatize them with cowardice before they were tried .

		However , whatever other vices they may have , cowardice is not one of them ... .

		We are ordered to the southward , of which I am glad , for the cold is very severe and intense at this moment .

		The Nautilus has been severely cannonaded by the Provincial batteries at
Cape Ann	LOCATION	; like military
Harlequins	ORGANIZATION	they attack us every where , God end this unnatural warfare .

Cobbil Hill	ORGANIZATION	, & that the Enemy do n't fire on you , & we are told that
Cannon	ORGANIZATION	have been very lately put on board boats at Bunker hill , which makes me conjecture , the Enemy are preparing to Decamp from
Boston	LOCATION	, in the meantime , no doubt they will shew
Cannon	ORGANIZATION	in the
Embrasures	LOCATION	next to the American Camp ー Their want of Provision will necessarily make them look out for other Winter quarters , as they canot depend on Suplys from
Great Brittain	LOCATION	at this Season , & more especialy as our Cruisers keep so good a look out for the Transports ー Although
Wallace	PERSON	has now at
Newport	ORGANIZATION	10
Sail of Armed Vessells	ORGANIZATION	, & yesterday we are told 7 Transports arrived there last Tuesday , -LRB- this last Accot doubtful as to Transports -RRB- yet I do n't beleive
Newport	LOCATION	is the place of the Enemys destination , as that
Island	LOCATION	doth afford many Cattle , and not any Grain , and should the Town be sett on Fire by the American Troops , the
Enemy	ORGANIZATION	would then have no Barracks ー my Opinion is that
New York	LOCATION	is the best place on the Continent for their Rendenvous , for although
New York	LOCATION	should be reduced to Ashes , yet
Long Island	LOCATION	is at hand , & wilt well suply them with
Barracks	ORGANIZATION	, & they will have the Range of that whole
Island	LOCATION	for the Winter , & will get there a great quantity of Stock , & plenty of Wheat ; as by their Ships they will make it extreem dificult for the
American Army	ORGANIZATION	to Annoy them on that
Island	LOCATION	, this Winter , nay it will be almost impossible .

		again they can be at
New York	LOCATION	, & entrench around
that City	LOCATION	, & prevent the Americans from Attacking them this Winter , as the
Army	ORGANIZATION	at your Camp is so remote , and the Southern Troops distant also ー nor would it do for an
Army	ORGANIZATION	to Encamp near
New York	LOCATION	, where they could have nothing but their Tents to Cover them , & no fire places the aproaching winter .

		I congratulate you on the good News from
Mount Real	LOCATION	, & expect the same good Accot from
Quebeck	LOCATION	eny moment ー three months since one of the
Conecticut Newspapers	ORGANIZATION	predicted that General
Carlton	PERSON	would be a Prisoner at
Hartford	LOCATION	, which Prophesy -LRB- I trust -RRB- will probably be soon fulfilled ー thus I have thrown out my loose conjectures , merely to divert my old Friend .

		And now to come nearer home , tell you , I have finished the Fort at
New London	LOCATION	, & all things ready -LSB- to -RSB- do what we can , when caled to it ー finding it dificult to point large Cannon directly to an Object , I have projected a Sight to be fixed near the mouth of Our Cannon , that will enable us to take as compleat an Aim at an object as can be done with a musket , the model of which is beneath & when you have examined whether it will answer my expectation or not , give your Opinion ー It is made of 2
Inch Oake Plank	ORGANIZATION	& feighd close down to the forend of the Cannon , & an I -LSB- ron -RSB- sight put into it , so as that the botom of the sight , and top of
Britch of the Cannon	PERSON	, having a streight line drawn from them , it will be paralel to the Chase of the Cannon , the sight to stand perpendicular over the Center of the Chase ー the piece of Plank must be woolded round the Cannon in two places where it is notched , & put a little hot Pitch or other Glutinous substance under the wood to prevent its moveing side ways , or / which is more certain bore a hole at each woolding Place , & drill a hole into the Cannon 1/2 Inch or more , & put in each an Iron pin before woo -LSB- lding -RSB- .

		Youl observe the model below stands off the Cannon , to give planer description , but it must be put firm on
Cannon	ORGANIZATION	before woulded ー thus hastily I have scratched out a model by which youl find what I intend ー My Heaven best of Blessings rest upon the

JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	TO BRIGADIER GENERAL RICHARD MONTGOMERY Sir ,
Philada Novr	PERSON	30th 1775 .

		I am directed by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to transmit you their Thanks for your great and signal Services in the Expedition committed to your Command against the British Troops in the Province of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The Reduction of
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	and
Montreal	LOCATION	they esteem of inexpressible Advantage to the
united Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, and the most mortifying Contravention to the ministerial System of enslaving the extensive Territory of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		It can not therefore fail of reflecting singular Lustre on the Character of a General so essentially instrumental in preserving that Liberty , by the Abolition of which , a corrupt
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	intended to annihilate every Appearance of Freedom in
America	LOCATION	.

		Nor , are the Humanity and Politeness , with which you have treated those in your Power less illustrious
Instances of Magnanimity	ORGANIZATION	, than the Valour , by which you reduced them to it .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	utterly abhorrent from every Species of Cruelty to Prisoners , and determined to adhere to this benevolent
Maxim	PERSON	, till the Conduct of their Enemies renders a Deviation from it indispensible necessary , will ever applaud their Officers for beautifully blending the Christian with the Conqueror ; and never , in endeavouring to acquire the Character of the Hero , to lose that of the Man .

		The Victories already gained in
Canada	LOCATION	afford us a happy Presage of die Smiles of
Providence	LOCATION	on the farther Designation of the
Continental Arms	ORGANIZATION	in the
North	LOCATION	, and will in all Probability greatly facilitate the entire Reduction of the deluded Malignants in that Province to ー Liberty .

		These , Sir , are Exp ` loits so glorious in their Execution and so extensive in their Consequences , that the Memory of Genl
Montgomery	PERSON	, will doubtless , be of equal Duration , with the Remembrance of the Benefits derived from his Command .

		At the same Time that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	rejoice with you in the Success of their Arms under your more immediate Direction , they can not avoid expressing their Concern at the Intimation you give of your Intention to retire from the Service .

		They are sensible that the Loss of so brave and experienced an Officer will be universally regretted as a Misfortune to all
America	LOCATION	.

		But they still hope , that upon reconsidering the Matter , the same generous and patriotic Motives , which first induced you to take so capital a Part in opposing the unprovoked Hostilities of an unnatural Enemy , will prompt you to persevere in the Cause , and to continue gathering fresh Laurels , till you find our Oppressions reduced to Reason , and
America	LOCATION	restored to her constitutional Liberties .

		LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	TO MAJOR GENERAL
WILLIAM HOWE	PERSON	Dear General On board the
Ship William	LOCATION	off
Norfolk	LOCATION	in
Virginia	LOCATION	30th Novr 1775 The report here is that General
Gage	PERSON	is gone home , and that you are appointed to Succeed him , if so , from my heart I give you Joy , and am well persuaded you will soon evince to the World that you are well deserving the Honor conferred on you , by your Soverign ; I must inform you that with our little
Corps	ORGANIZATION	I think we have done wonders , We have taken and destroyed above four Score pieces of Ordnance , and by landing in different parts of the Country , we keep then in continual Hott Water , but as Captn
Leslie	PERSON	tells me he means to write to you on this Subject I have no doubt he will give you particulars enough so shall say no more on that Subject .

		Amongst the Prisoners we have taken are
Oliver Porter	PERSON	, and
Dean two Natives of Boston	ORGANIZATION	, the former was taken as you see by His own deposition -LRB- No 1 -RRB- bringing in Gun Powder to
North Carolina	LOCATION	, the latter was sent from
Boston	LOCATION	to inflame the minds of the People , in which he had been but too Successfull , he was taken from on board a Schooner going from this to the
Western Islands	LOCATION	to bring Powder to this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and the others have carried Arms against His Majesty in this Province , I have sent them more with a view of intimidating others , than to punish them , as they expect here that so sure as they are sent to
Boston	LOCATION	they are to be hanged , -LSB-
William -RSB- Robinson	PERSON	is a delegate of our Convention as you see by his deposition -LRB- No 2 -RRB- , -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Mathews	PERSON	was a Captain of their Minute men ; perhaps they may be of use to you in exchanging them for good men .

		There is a vacancy in the 14th Regiment by the Death of
Captn Blacket	PERSON	, I realy should not do them justice if I did not recommend it to you to let the promotion go in the
Corps	ORGANIZATION	, which I hope you will do .

		The Sloop not sailing so soon as I expected , 2 I have to inform you that on the 14th Ins -LSB- t -RSB- I had information that a party of about a hundred of the
North Carolina Rebels	ORGANIZATION	had marched to the Assistance of those in this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and were posted at a place Called the great Bridge , a very essential pass into this part of the Country , I accordingly embarked our little Corps of the 14th in Boats , in the Night with between Twenty and thirty Volunteers from
Norfolk	LOCATION	, we landed within four
Miles of the Bridge	LOCATION	, and arrived there a little after day light , but to our great mortification found the birds had flown the evening before ; but hearing that a body of between two and three hundred of our Rebels were within a bout ten
Miles	PERSON	of us , we determined to beat up their quarters , and accordingly proceeded about eight
Miles	PERSON	when they fired on our advanced guard from the Wood , on which I immediately ordered our People to rush in upon them , and at the same time sent a part of the Regulars with the Volunteers to out flank them , the Enemy immediately fled on all quarters , and our People pursued them for a Mile or more , killed a few , drove others into a
Creek	LOCATION	where they were drowned , took nine prisoners among which is one of their Colonels , we had only one man wounded who is recovering .

		I can not conclude without again informing you that my friends of the 14th both Officers and Soldiers have in this late as well as on all former occasions behaved with that good Conduct , and Spirit , becoming British Soldiers .

		Immediately on this I issued the inclosed Proclamation which has had a Wonderfull effect as there are not less than three thousand that have already taken and signed the inclosed Oath .

		The Negroes are flocking in also from all quarters which I hope will oblige the Rebels to disperse to take care of their families , and property , and had I but a few more men here I would March immediately to
Williamsburg	LOCATION	my former place of residence by which I should soon compell the whole Colony to Submit .

		We are in great want of small Arms , and if two or three light field pieces and their Carriages could be Spared they would be of great Service to us , also some Cartridge paper of which not a Sheet is to be got here , and all our Cartridges expended .

		Since the 28th of May last I have not received a Single line from any one in Administration , tho I have wrote Volumes to them in each of which I have prayed to be instructed but to no purpose , I am therefore determined to go on doing the best in my power for His Majesty 's Service , I have accordingly ordered a Regiment -LRB- Called the
Queens	LOCATION	own
Loyal Virginia Regiment	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of 500 men to be raised immediately consisting of a Lieutenant Colonel commandent , a Major and Ten Companys each of which is to consist of one Captain , 2 Lieutenants one
Ensign	PERSON	and 50 Privates with none Commissionerd Officers in proportion ; You may observe by my Proclamation that I offer freedom to the Slaves , -LRB- of all Rebels -RRB- that join me , in consequence of which there are between two and three hundred already come in and these I form into a Corps as fast as they come in giving them white Officers and Non Commissioned Officers in proportion , and from these two plans I make no doubt of geting men enough to reduce this Colony to a proper sense of their duty , but my next distress will be want of Arms Acoutrements and Money , all of which perhaps you may be able to releive me from , the latter I am sure you can as there are many Merchants here who are ready to supply me on my giving them bills on you which you will have to withdraw and give your own in their place .

		I hope this mode will be agreeable to you it is the same that General
Gage	PERSON	proposed ; I have now in order to carry on the Recruiting business victualing Cloathing & c & c & c drawn on you for five thousand Pounds Sterling , and have appointed a pay Master who will keep exact accounts .

		I wish you would by the return of the Sloop inform me what bounty Money may be given to those who inlist .

		Having heard that a thousand chosen Men belonging to the Rebels , a great part of which were Rifle men , were on their March to attack us here so to cut off our provisions , I determined to take possession of the pass at the great Bridge which Secures us the greatest part of two Counties to supply us with provisions .

		I accordingly ordered a Stockade Fort to be erected there , which was done in a few days , and I put an Officer and Twenty five men to Garrison it , with some Volunteers and Negroes , who have defended it against all the efforts of the Rebels for these eight days past , we have killed Several of their Men , and I make no doubt we shall now be able to maintain our ground there , but should we be obliged to abandon it , we have thrown up an Entrenchment on the Land side of
Norfolk	LOCATION	which I hope they never will be able to force here we are with only a very small part of a Regiment contending against the extensive Colony of
Virginia	LOCATION	; if you would but Spare me for a few Months the 64th Regiment now in the Castle and the remaining part of the 14th I realy believe we should reduce this Colony to a proper sense of their Duty .

Cambridge	LOCATION	1st Decr 1775 ー Your favour of the 27th came safe to hand at a time when we were all flush 'd with the agreeable Accot of Capt Manly 's having taken a prize of the utmost Consequence , which made us look over the Potatoes & turnips of Capt
Adams	PERSON	, but now being a little cool , I assure you I do not think
Adams	PERSON	bon fortune so despicable tho ' of little Value to us , it is depriving the Enemy of what to them , wou 'd be of Consequence , as to the Prisoners I wish you had kept or discharged them as in future , you will please to let the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	examine such as in these Circumstances may fall into your hands & they will Judge of the best Method of disposing of them ー the Money you advance must be a Charge against the Capture ー I doubt not of Captain
Adams	PERSON	's frugality & Attention , you will therefore Supply him with what Necessarys he Calls for , you will please to dispose of the Cargo by the
Rainbow	ORGANIZATION	, 2 & Lay up the Schooner until further Orders ー tho ' if a reasonable price can be got for her , you may dispose of her , this is left to your better Judgment ー I have Supply
Benja Chandler	PERSON	ten Dollars towards defreying their expence back , this must also become a Charge upon the Capture , I hope
Adams	PERSON	will soon take such a prize as Manly has , I realy believe the Cargo Cou 'd not Cost Short of # 10,000 Sterlg ー to us it is invaluable ー Adieu my dear Sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB- S. M ー 1 .

STEPHEN MOYLAN	PERSON	TO
WILLIAM WATSON	PERSON	Sir
Cambridge	LOCATION	1st Decr 1775 ー Your favours of the 23rd & 29th Ulto are come to hand ー Capt Coit 's Lieutenant has been here , gives an Account of his Schooner being so Old & Crazy as to be unfit for the Service She is imploy 'd in , if there was a possibility of fixing a better Vessel out , in Six or eight days & removing the guns & c from on board the Schooner , his Excellency wou 'd be glad it cou 'd be done , as there are Storeships & transports expected all this Month , but that Mutinous Spirit which reigns thro ' the
Marines & Sailors	ORGANIZATION	makes the General dispair of your being able to effect this to any purpose , so that I believe it is best to give the Affair up , & not put the Publick to an unnecessary expence , you must be the proper Judge in this matter , to you His Excellency Leaves it Adverting that if the Vessel Can not be fitted & Men willing to go in her , within the abovementioned time , you are to Lay the Schooner up , have the
Ammunition Stores	ORGANIZATION	& every thing on board Carefully Secured , a proper Inventory taken of them Signed by the proper Officers , & transmitted to Head Quarters , by first good Conveyance ー Should this be Necessary you will please to inform Captain Coit , that it is His Excellency 's Orders that he make what dispatch he Can to Camp with the Men under his Command ー As to Captain
Martindale	PERSON	's People , it is his Excellency 's Orders , that all such as are unwilling to proceed to
Cruize	PERSON	with him , be immediately sent to Camp to join their respective Regiments under the Care of an Officer , & if Captain
Martindale	PERSON	Can with your assistance get people to go with him , they shall Receive 40 / ,
LMo p Month	ORGANIZATION	, & One third of all prizes they may have the good Luck to Make ー divided agreeable to the instructions given unto the Captain , indeed the Shares I believe will be on a better Plan than therein Mentioned as it is now under
Consideration of Congress	ORGANIZATION	to allow one third of all Vessels & Cargoes to the Captors ー Should you & Captain
Martindale	PERSON	find it impossible to get Men on these terms in a reasonable time I must only say , that the deficiency of publick Spirit in this Country is much more , than I cou 'd possibly have an Idea of ー His Excellency has been abroad whilest I wrote the foregoeing ー it is his desire that as the Brigte 2 is So well fitted , that at all events she must be sent out to Cruize ー she is on the publick service , & Ceremony Must be waved , so that if Capt Martindale Can not get hands to go with him , you Must put in Captain
Coit	PERSON	or any one else that Can as his being detaind in Port now may be of the utmost Prejerdice to the American Cause , fourteen Transports with military stores
Saild in Company	ORGANIZATION	with one now taken by Capt Manly , of imense value his Crew will Make their fortunes by Manlys activity .

		I am Sorry to think that this is a qualification that
Martindale	PERSON	is defficient in , at Least he has given reason for the General to think so ー Coud not a Crew for the Brigte be picked out of both Vessels , in fine get her out , Let the expence be what it will , & put what Captain & Crew you think best for the good of the Service on board of her ー S.

Jeremiah Halsey	PERSON	arrived Express from
Canada	LOCATION	, to his Honor Governor
Trumbull	PERSON	, at
Lebanon	LOCATION	, with the following important and interesting Intelligence , viz. That on the Night of the 12th Instant General
Carleton	PERSON	, after having spiked up the Cannon , and drove Balls into the Muzzles , robbed the Merchants of what Quantities of Powder they were possessed off , shipped it and all the small Arms on board the Transports and armed Vessels ; and , with about 100 Soldiers , and as many Canadian Tories as were inclined to go , embarked and abandoned the City of
Montreal	LOCATION	.

		ー That on Monday the 13th , the Inhabitants , after being assured that they would be allowed the free Exercise of their Religion , and that their Property should not be invaded , opened the Gates , and gave Possession to our Forces , under the Command of General
Montgomery	PERSON	.

		It is imagined that General
Carleton	PERSON	will not reach
Quebec	LOCATION	with his Forces , and that he is only carrying down the Powder , small Arms , & c. to save us the Trouble ; as we have a Detachment of our Army at the Mouth of the River Sorrel , under the Command of Colonel

JOSIAH MARTIN Sir Cherokee Armed Ship in Rebellion Road	ORGANIZATION	1 Decr 1775 .

		In the present critical & distress 'd situation of Affairs I can not express how happy I think myself in meeting your Excellency in this Province a Pleasure I have long and ardently wished for .

		A mature consideration of the state of the two
Carolinas	LOCATION	and
Georgia	LOCATION	will I conceive make it very apparent that every rebellious measure which has been adopted in this part of the continent originated in
Charlestown	LOCATION	, and should we be able with our little Force to make any impression here I am convinced it would be attended with the best consequences , not only in this but in the neighbouring Governments .

		As this is my firm opinion I most sincerely hope that while we have any prospect of effecting this great point your Excellency will agree with me in thinking our Force should not be divided ; But should it be thought impracticable to do anything material in this Province , I shall not hesitate a moment in going wherever the King 's Arms can be employed to the greatest advantage .

		We are engaged , Sir , in one common cause and I have not a doubt but we shall maintain the most cordial Friendship , and you may command every information it is in my power to give that can assist you in judging on this occasion of the real State of this important Province .

		I am with the greatest esteem Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-

JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	TO LORD
WILLIAM CAMPBELL	PERSON	My Lord Scorpion Sloop of War in Rebellion Road , Decr 1st 1775 .

		I am honoured with your Excellency 's Letter of this Day 's date by the hand of Captain
Innes	PERSON	, and I feel myself sensibly obliged by your Lordships very kind & flattering expressions of your satisfaction on my arrival in this Province .

		The Pleasure I enjoy in meeting your Excellency in your Government I owe to the prevalence of your Lordship 's insistances with Captain
Thornbrough	PERSON	to order the Scorpion Sloop of War from her station at
No Carolina	LOCATION	to this place , that reduced me to the necessity of choosing between the alternatives of returning to my very inconvenient and streigtened quarters on board the Cruizer Sloop , whose little Force did not assure me of protection from the Rebels in that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, or of coming hither in the Scorpion , which I could not think myself justified in detaining there while I was taught to believe that danger so nearly impended , or rather so closely pressed , upon your Excellency and Captain
Thornbrough	PERSON	.

		Amidst this choice of difficulties , I determined on the latter part ; that the Scorpion might give such succour as your immediate exigencies should require ; and that I might at the same time concert some plan of operations for the restoration of his Majesty 's Government in both our Provinces , agree -LSB- a -RSB- ble to your Lordship 's proposition to me by your Letter of September , on being made acquainted with the foundation of it ; and make my representations to your Excellency , and to Captain
Thornbrough	PERSON	on the expediency of the Scorpion 's return to her appointed Station in
North Carolina	LOCATION	; where the posture of affairs is so critical and in a state promising so great advantages to Government as to demand every cherishing support and all my most vigilant attention .

		In this situation of things , your Lordship , I am persuaded will not be surprised , that my satisfaction on meeting you here is not without alloy , arising from the anxiety & solicitude , of which I can not possibly divest myself , while I am conscious of being out of the Sphere of my Duty to the King ; and when I consider , that I am remote from my proper station , which becomes every Day more interesting and important , and wherein I expect very soon to be enabled effectually to promote His Majesty 's Service .

		It can little avail your Excellency or myself to Enquire , or to know where the now generally prevailing
Spirit of Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	originated .

		It is a melancholy Truth , of which no Evidence is wanting , that at this Day it is spread almost universally over this Continent ; that both our Provinces have received the fatal contagion and that they are deeply involved in all the Criminality and Guilt belonging to it ; and I flatter myself your Lordship will do me the justice to believe , that I am most heartily willing , and disposed to cooperate with your Lordship for the restoration of His Majesty 's Government in the one & the other .

		My Duty to the King as Govr of No Carolina Your Lordship knows necessarily makes the reclaiming that Province to obedience to lawful authority the first object of my attention , next to that , my wishes would lead me to make myself as much , and as far useful as my humble abilities may render me to His Majesty 's Services in general ; and I should be particularly happy to find myself in any situation to be at all conducive to the success of Your Lordship 's endeavours to restore the authority of His Majesty 's Government in this Colony .

		An Impression made here or anywhere else My Lord at this time would produce extensive ; good effects without doubt , and no opportunity of making it ought to be neglected but I am not acquainted with any means your Lordship has to make impression here in the present moment and your Excellency must be sensible from my representations of the State of
North Carolina	LOCATION	how unfit and unbecoming as well as how unjustifiable it would be in me to desert my Post there and to turn my back upon all my fair prospects of reducing that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	to order , on pretence of watching in your Excellency 's Province and
Department	ORGANIZATION	for possible or even probable , remote , favorable contingencies , of which your Lordship expects to avail yourself for the restoration of the authority of Government here , & that I may sincerly hope may accomplish all your good wishes .

		As I do not understand that His Majesty 's Service can be at all promoted by the Scorpion 's stay here at this time and as my Duty indispensibly and pressingly urges my return to
North Carolina	LOCATION	, I have requested Captain
Thornbrough	PERSON	to order the Scorpion to repair to her Station , forthwith , lamenting that I have it not in my power to spend more time with your Excellency at present .

		I beg leave to repeat my assurances to your Excellency , that I shall be very happy on every occasion to cooperate with you for the advancement of His Majesty 's Service , and to maintain the kindest reciprocations of Friendship , by every means of communication and correspondence .

		I have the honor to be with the greatest respect My Lord -LSB- & c. -RSB- Jo :

GILBERT BARKLY	PERSON	TO SIR GREY COOPER -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RSB- 2d December 1775 Sir As the
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	is now entirely under the direction of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and all letters Oppned and read by a
Comittee	ORGANIZATION	appointed for that purpose , the outmost precaution is Necessary to keep my Intelligence from hence , from their knowledge , this and the importnce of the discovery I have made , Urged me to Apply to a man of who 's fidelity I have the best Oppinnion , to go Express with this by the Packet from
New York	LOCATION	.

		Tuo Ships , one , to carry thirty four guns , and the other thirty , with tuo briganteens to mount sixteen guns each , are fitting out at this Port with great diligence , the whole of them Extream fast sailing Vessels : 2 My outmost Efforts have been used to find out their destination which with much dificulty I have Effectuated by the force of money .

		They are to proceed to the Island of
Acention	LOCATION	, and Cruize betuixt it and the Island of
St Helena	ORGANIZATION	for the homeward bound
East India	LOCATION	ships , which they are to take and carry into the most Convenient Ports they can get to in this Country ; the great Object of this Expedition is in order to get possession of the salt petre generaly brought home by them , with the assistance of which their oun mills can make any quantity of gun pouder they require ; this discovery Sir I recone an object of the first magnitude , particularly as I flatter myself , it will arrive time enough for dispatching men of war to frustrate such an Arrogant designe .

		3 It is Very extraordinary that there has been no kings ships in this river for above three months past , many Vessells from hence are applying at foreign Ports for gun pouder and arms etc : I understand from some who arrived lately from
St Ustatia	LOCATION	, that there was none to be got at any price in that
Island	LOCATION	, nor can I learn of any got from the French Islands of late , which has mightely damped their sanguin expectations .

		There is 20000 barrels of flower just now ashiping off by order , and for account and risque of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, to go ahunting to different Ports for gunpouder , and Arm 's etc : the places of their destination , I can not learn , nor do I beleive they are yet fixed on , however if
Cruizers	PERSON	are appointed on this Coast early in the Spring , it will be deficult for them to get into Port .

		The Northern Assemblies are making Acts to encourage the fitting out Privateers and assuredly if they can only get gun pouder , -LRB- as they are making Cannon and ball -RRB- those Vermin will prove troublesome ... The great object they had in view by the Expedition to
Cannada	PERSON	is the expectation of geting Possesion of the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	military stores , of which I flatter myself they will be frustrated , gunpouder above all things is the article they are most in want of , and if they are deprived in Supply 's of that article , their great boastings will soon be at an end : much is expected from the Success of the Expedition I have mentioned , and in order to give it the Apperance of making a just Reprisall , they are gathering an account of the Value of the Howses , burnt at
Charles	PERSON	town by the
King	ORGANIZATION	's troops , and others destroyed by the
Kings Ships	ORGANIZATION	, as also the Value of the Vessells Caryed into
Boston	LOCATION	, etc. .

		by the men of war : this is adoing by express orders from the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		4 I am still of Oppinnion if a powrful army , and some men of war , was sent to this place in the Spring and a Royal Proclamation published , with the promjse of Pardon to those who would Join the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	standard , that it wou 'd have the best Effects : Should this happen they would disperss the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and thousands of those who are at present in
Army	ORGANIZATION	, would join the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	forces .

		I doubt not but the Vessells I have mentioned , will saill in less , than a month from this date as the utmost dilligence is used in fitting them out ... 3d December Since I finished my letter I am informed that a twenty gun Ship from
Road Island	LOCATION	is to join those fitting out at this place .

		5 500 Sea men are also coming from the Northeren Provences to man those Ships , and one million of dollars is to be struck for the avowed support of a
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, in short they are so daring in their designes , that unless great
Britain	LOCATION	exerts her self to strick an Effectual Stroke , and that Speedely , the Consequence may prove fatal ... It is thought that some of the ships who have sailled , and others who are ready to saill with
Flowr	PERSON	, are intended for
France	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	, in order to procure gunpouder and Arms , and I 'm told some
Vessells	ORGANIZATION	, are gone to
Denmark	LOCATION	, and
Sueden	PERSON	, on the same designe , in short every Effort they can think of is made use of to get provided in those Articles .

FRANCIS LIGHTFOOT	PERSON	LEE TO
ROBERT WORMSLEY	PERSON	CARTER Dear Sir -LSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, December 2 -RSB- 2 We have had nothing new since the reduction of
Montreal	LOCATION	, which I suppose you must have heard of .

		It is supposed
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	must be in possession of Quebec by this time , if he shou 'd be too weak to effect it ,
Montgomerie	PERSON	will join him from
Montreal	LOCATION	.

		At all events we have got the most valuable part of
Canada	LOCATION	, as it cuts off all communication with the Indians , & prevents inroads on our fronteers .

		It wou 'd give me infinite pleasure , if our affairs to the Southward wore as favorable an Aspect ; it will require very vigorous efforts , to put a stop to the proceedings of Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	.

		We are extreamly alarm 'd by an express from the Comtee of
Northhampton County	LOCATION	to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, informing that he has issued a Proclamation , declaring military Law in
Virga	PERSON	& offering freedom to all servants & slaves , who shall repair to the King 's standard , which he has erected ; That the inhabitants of
Norfolk & Princess Ann Counties	ORGANIZATION	have taken an Oath to oppose , to the last drop of their blood , any of their Countrymen who shall come in arms into their Counties .

		The
Comtee	PERSON	asks for assistance , being apprehensive that their people from their exposed situation , & the number of their slaves , will thro fear , be induced to follow the example of the other two Counties .

		We have got the Proclamation I have been thus full , least the letters from
Northhampton	LOCATION	to our Comtee of safety , shoud be intercepted ; which they were apprehensive of .

		this intelligence gives great concern to all the real friends of
America	LOCATION	; & subjects Your Countrymen to the sneers of its disguised Enemies , & the lukewarm Fatal consequences may follow if an immediate stop is not put to that
Devil	PERSON	's career .

		I shoud think a sufficient force of Militia or Minute men shou 'd immediately be sent to drive him & his adherent on board the ships ; The estates of the inhabitants of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, or elsewhere , who have taken arms agst the Country shoud be sequesterd for its defence .

		The proclamation burnt by the hangman , & heav ' y penalties inflicted on those who disperse them thro ' the Country .

		the patroles shou 'd be very diligent .

		will it not be necessary for the convention by a short Ordinance , to establish the present Laws & Judges ?

		It wou 'd contribute more than anything to the quiet & safety of the people , & security of our commerce in the spring , if the Convention wou 'd exert themselves in fitting out small armed Vessells , to prevent small tenders from infesting the bays & rivers ; if it can not be done in
Virga	PERSON	they might be procured here .

		probably
Virga	PERSON	might spare powder for this purpose , but without very bad fortune we shall soon have it in .

		it is inconceivable what good effects have been produced from such a measure to the Northward , not a tender dares to come from under the Guns of the large ships ; & the Vessells employ 'd by the
Army	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	to procure wood & provisions are every day falling into our hands .

		There are small guns in several parts of
Virga	PERSON	, a few at
Robb	ORGANIZATION	's hole , & Col.
-LSB- William -RSB- Fauntleroys	PERSON	.

		the furnaces shoud be set to casting them .

		God prosper your deliberations .

DIXON	PERSON	AND HUNTER 'S
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	GAZETTE , SATURDAY , DECEMBER 2 , 1775
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, December 2 .

		Since Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	's proclamation made its appearance here , it is said he has recruited his army , in the counties of Princess
Anne	PERSON	and
Norfolk	LOCATION	, to the amount of about 2000 men , including his black regiment , which is thought to be a considerable part , with this inscription on their breasts : ー `` Liberty to Slaves . ''

		ー However , as the rivers will henceforth be strictly watched , and every possible precaution taken , it is hoped others will be effectually prevented from joining those his Lordship has already collected .

		The army that went down last week , under command of Col.
Woodford	PERSON	, to obstruct
Dunmore	PERSON	's progress of enlisting men in the lower counties , fell in with a party of twelve or thirteen of
Dunmore	PERSON	's friends , and made them all prisoners .

		Lieut. Col.
-LSB- Charles -RSB- Scott	PERSON	, with the advanced guard , upon his arrival at the
Great Bridge	LOCATION	, found the enemy entrenched there , and it is said a smart firing began by some of the riflemen , which was returned , and continued a considerable time on both sides , but to what effect we know not .

		It is also said , that Thursday last -LSB- November 28 -RSB- was fixed upon by our troops to begin a general attack ; they were healthy ; in good spirits , and had great prospect of success .

		Some accounts from
Norfolk	LOCATION	are , that
Dunmore	PERSON	's party has demolished several houses back of the town , and fortified themselves ; also , that Col. -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Hutchings	PERSON	, and some other Gentlemen , their prisoners , had been removed to the ships on account of the gaol having been set on fire .

		Last Wednesday night -LSB- November 28 -RSB- some of
Dunmore	PERSON	's bandits , about 12 , mostly Negroes , came ashore , and went to the house of Mr.
Benjamin Wells	PERSON	, at Mulberry island ; after threatening and abusing him in a most infamous manner , they robbed him of all his most valuable effects , and carried off two Negro women .

		LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	TO MAJOR GENERAL
WILLIAM HOWE	PERSON	Dear General The bearer of this whose name is
John Eustace	PERSON	is the Son of an unfortunate widow Gentlewoman in this Country , I have had the Care of Him for these three Years past , and have given him the best Education this Country could afford .

		He is a very good latin scholar , of exceeding good
Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, & quick parts , of excellent temper , & good disposition , has conceived a great desire to go into the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, I have therefore to intreat you when an opportunity offers to give him a
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, & I think he will do me no discredit , & you much Service ; if you are kind enough to employ him , I should be much obliged to you if you would recommend him to some prudent Officer who would take the trouble now and then to give him a little good advice for the only fault I know in him -LRB- if it can be called one in a Boy -RRB- is that he is a little Volatile ; pray spare us some troops if you can possibly do it , consistant with your Orders , even the Recruits of the 14th Regt would be of service to us ; those ordered from
St Augustine	LOCATION	are not yet arrived , tho ' hourly expected , was the whole Regt here I think we should be able to do some good .

		I have sent you a Sloop 2 with some Indian Corn , Oats , & a few Irish potatoes , all of which he told me -LRB- I mean Major
Connolly	PERSON	-RRB- were much wanted , I could have sent you any quantity of Oats -LRB- such as they are -RRB- , if I could have got a larger vessel ; I wish to God I had some of your Light Horse here , this is a fine Country for them to act in , and food of all kinds in great abundance for both men & Horses ; a winter Campaign would reduce , without the smallest doubt the whole of this southern Continent to a perfect state of obedience , one esential service it would render you , which is that I could supply your
Army & Navy	ORGANIZATION	with every necessary of life & that in the greatest abundance , which is more than any other Colony on the Continent could do .

		CAPTAIN
MATTHEW SQUIRE	PERSON	, R.N. , TO VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES Sir Otter Sloop off
Norfolk	LOCATION	.

		2d Decr 1775 My Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	having a quantity of Corn ー which he understands would be of great service to , -LRB- and was much wanted for the Cavalry to the Northward -RRB- and beg 'd I would send some men in a Sloop to carry it to
Boston	LOCATION	, I have therefore for the good of the service , sent a Petty Officer and six of my People in the
Betsey Sloop	PERSON	for that purpose , In my last to you of the 13th September by the Mercury , I informed you that the People of this part of
Virginia	LOCATION	seem 'd to be peaceably inclined , but am sorry to say that for these two months past , they have taken every method to annoy the Kings Ships , Boats & Troops where-ever they see them , firing on them on all occasions .

		I some time since went in a Tender with three other Tenders in Company in order to prevent their sinking Vessels in the mouth of
Hampton Harbour	LOCATION	when they fired on me , and killed two of my People , and wounded two more , and from the imprudence of the Officer on board a small Tender running to near the town , their Musquetry was so great that several of my People swam from her to me , and the Rebels took the Vessel with four men , which Men they have since returned .

		On the 14 of last Month His Excellency Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, and the detachment of the 14th Regiment embarked in Boats from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, and went up a
River	LOCATION	near a place called the
Great Bridge	LOCATION	intending to dislodge some men that he had heard was there , whose intention was to stop Provisions coming to
Norfolk	LOCATION	.

		His Lordship from thence , in his March to
Norfolk	LOCATION	, was attack 'd and fired on by some Rebels whom he soon drove off , after killing one , and taking seven or eight Prisoners , with a Colonel
Lawson	PERSON	& Colonel
Hutchins	PERSON	men who have been very buisy in currupting the minds of the Poor deluded people of this Colony : His Lordship then issued his Proclamation -LRB- a copy of which I send you , -RRB- As Mr
John Atkinson	PERSON	the Petty Officer that brings you this , was a Volunteer with Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	on the expedition I refer you to him for more particulars .

		We have now a small fort at the
Great Bridge	LOCATION	, which the Rebels must pass to come to
Norfolk	LOCATION	.

		we have destroyed the Bridge , and for these ten days past , have kept a body of near nine hundred Rebels from passing .

		We have likewise entrenched the town of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, and I have great reason to suppose , & hope from their being such Cowards , and Cold weather coming on , that they will return to their respective homes , & we shall be quiet the remainder of the Winter .

		I am securing all the Provisions I can , for the King 's Ships and hope to get a sufficient quantity untill we can have a supply from the Northward .

		I must hope sir when in your Power to spare a Victualer you will send one .

		I by desire have sent two Prisoners taken by his Lordship no doubt but his Lordship has sent their accusations ; Two ー other Prisoners taken by
Captn Montagu	PERSON	the one
Captn Dean	PERSON	, whose accusation I here inclose , the other a Captn Porter 2 for bringing Powder and Shot for the Rebels , & in sight of the King 's Tenders throwing it overboard .

		Enclosed I send you the State and Condition of His Majestys Sloops Otter & Kingsfisher , with the demands for Stores from the Officers of the said Sloops .

		I am well convinced that had we a few more troops , and one or two more Ships , that the Rebels in these parts would be very soon quieted .

		Am also to acquaint you , that from the
Boatswain	PERSON	of the Otters frequently behaving in a tyrannical manner to the
Ships Company	ORGANIZATION	, often Insolent to the Officers , as well as neglecting his duty , I have thought proper to suspend him , and have given an acting order to one of my Seamen .

		Enclosed I send you three Letters , which I received from St Augustine to be forwarded to you , and am Sir with assurances that all that can be done for the good of the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	shall be done by Sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB- 1 .

		Orders were given that she should be unloaded with all possible Expedition & we have now the greatest Part of her Cargo safely housed in the Labratory here .

		Col.

Army	ORGANIZATION	been consulted they could not have made out a compleater

R.N. Sir Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	3 Decr 1775 , By the General

Jacob	PERSON	, and
Elizabeth Brigs	PERSON	, laden with Arms , Ammunition , Cloathing & c. for the

		Capt.
Hamilton	PERSON	writes me the disagreeable News that the Garrison of

Montreal	LOCATION	is invested and must soon surrender , it being a place of no Strength and in Want of Provisions ; that the Rebels are in possession of Point
Levi	PERSON	, and General
Carleton	PERSON	is on board the Gaspee coming to
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		It is more than ever necessary to keep Possession of and prevent the Rebels fortifying , the Sea Ports , and their getting Supplies of Provisions of any Sort to prolong the War .

		Inclosed you have an Order to detain the
Asia	LOCATION	.


New York	LOCATION	must at all Events be kept for the King .

		The short time the Ice is in the River you must bestow the Ships where you think best , and the moment you can place them before the Town let it be done .

		Intelligence this moment is received that the Rebels have a Frigate of 36 Guns , a Ship of 20 .

		and others nearly ready at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and that they design to attack the Kings Ships at
Virginia	LOCATION	; 2 therefore if the
Asia	LOCATION	and
Phoenix	LOCATION	can not safely winter at

Virginia	LOCATION	or send Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	, which ever you think best for the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	: but if both can remain at -LSB-

		I expect the
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	and one or two Sloops are at
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		The Raven will call there in her way to

DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Boston	LOCATION	, 3 December 1775 I learn the
Nancy Brigantine an Ordnance Transport	ORGANIZATION	ー having on Board 4000 Stand of Arms complete 100,000 Flints , a Thirteen Inch Mortar with other Stores in Proportion , was taken in the
Bay	LOCATION	last week by the Rebels Privateers , and affords an Instance for this Necessity .

		2 The Circumstance is rather unfortunate to us , as they are now furnished with all the Requisites for setting the Town on Fire , having got a large Quantity of round Carcasses and other Stores , with which they could not have been otherwise Supplied .

		The particular manner whereby she was taken is not ascertained , but so many Artifices have been practised upon Strangers , under the Appearance of Friendship , false Pilots , & ca that those coming out with Stores of any Kind can not be put too much upon their Guard .

		And I submit to your Lordship the Necessity there may be of supplying the Loss of Arms Flints , & ca suffered on this Occasion .

		The Admiral has informed me that , by a Letter received this Day from Captain
Wallace	PERSON	, of the Rose Ship of War , stationed at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, the Rebels give out they are to fortify the Heights above the
Town of Newport	ORGANIZATION	; also that they are fitting out an armed Ship at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to carry 36 Guns , and two or three more of a less Force , with a Design of Cruising to the Southward , and to take Lord

JOSEPH WARD	PERSON	TO
JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB- Camp at
Roxbury	ORGANIZATION	3 Decr .

		1775 The good success of our Privateers , which you will hear before this reaches you , is very encouraging , and , I hope it will stimulate the seafaring Gentlemen to greater exertions in that way .

		I think we have a prospect of important advantages from exertions by sea , and I hope , with you Sir , this will be done by the Colonies separately , as , for many reasons , that greater advantages will arise thereby to the great
Cause of America	LOCATION	.

		.

		.

		But very few Vessels have arrived at
Boston	LOCATION	from
Britain	LOCATION	for a long time , & by the best accounts , not more than 250 of the great reinforcement which the Enemy have so long talked of I believe 2300 is the most that they expect this Fall : The Troops in
Boston	LOCATION	continue sickly , & it is said they are not in so good Spirits as they were in the Summer : If we can obtain a supply of Powder I trust we shall give a good account of them before Spring ; if it be possible we must subdue the
Ministerial Fleet & Army	ORGANIZATION	which is in
America	LOCATION	this Winter , otherwise we may expect a strong reinforcement in the Spring .

		Should we conquer what are here , I apprehend the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	would not hazard another expedition , but if they should we might be able to resist all their force .

		I think we have nothing to fear but ourselves , and if we do our duty we may gain every political advantage the heart of Man can desire .

Halifax	LOCATION	ー 4th Decr ー 1775 I think it my duty to acquaint your Excellency that in compliance with your instructions I proceeded as far as
Annapolis Royal	LOCATION	in my way to
St John	PERSON	's River that during the course of seventeen days I repeatedly attempted to cross the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	but was each time drove back into the
Basin of Annapolis	LOCATION	by contrary winds ー that as the beginning of the Winter had been uncommonly severe from violent gales of wind blowing from the
North East	LOCATION	ー to the North West which had occasioned repeated Snow Storms and an intense frost ー which , from the best information I could receive , wuld render the navigation of the River St
John	PERSON	's impracticable till the middle of January ー I found it impossible therefore any further to attempt to penetrate to the Settlements of the Indians on
St. John 's River	LOCATION	and accordingly I left
Annapolis	LOCATION	on the 28th of
Novr	LOCATION	and returned to this place last night ー I think it also my duty to acquaint your Excellency that in compliance with your request ー I made it my constant employment , when on my journey to , & from
Annapolis	LOCATION	, to converse with many of the Inhabitants of the several Townships through which I passed ー in order to discover their Principles ー Views ー Sentiments ー Wishes ー Hopes ー & Fears ー Very sorry am I to report on this occasion that their Principles are Republican ー Their Views , to subvert the English Constitution in this Province ー Their Sentiments , taken generally , are , that there is too much power vested in the Governor , and speaking consequent -LSB- ly upon -RSB- Principles , they assert , that all his authority should -LSB- line missing -RSB- .

		Their Wishes are , that the Rebels of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, and
New England	LOCATION	may invade this Province in the ensuing Spring ー Their Hopes are , to profit by the confusion which they imagine will be the necessary consequence of the Invasion ー Their Fears are , least by mistake they should join the weaker Party & suffer with them accordingly ー Early in the Summer they refused to send any Provisions or Vegetables to the Troops in
Boston	LOCATION	ー they declared that they never would grant the least assistance to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	which was endeavouring to inslave their friends & Relations , meaning the Rebels , the people of
New England	LOCATION	, &
New Hampshire	LOCATION	ー But when the Tartar Frigate was stationed at
Annapolis	LOCATION	, the
Senegal	LOCATION	in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	ー and the Merlin in the Bas -LSB- in -RSB- of
Minas	ORGANIZATION	ー & seeing no probability of the Rebels making a descent into this Province ー they immediately dispatched m -LSB- any -RSB- Sloops & Schooners laden with Provisions to
Boston	LOCATION	for which they received exorbitant prices ー Yet they always abused the Masters of these Sloops & Schooners on their return to this Province , affirming that they were enemies to their Relations of
New England	LOCATION	, by selling to the Troops in
Boston	LOCATION	the very articles with which they had intrusted them to sell ー alledging that they should not have gone to
Boston	LOCATION	with the Provisions because they were Natives of New England ー I can assure your Excellency , upon my Honor , that in all the conversations which I had with several English Men settled in
Windsor ー Horton	LOCATION	ー Cornwallis ー Cumberl -LSB- and -RSB- & Granville Townships they universally agreed ー that all -LSB- line missing -RSB- &

Boston	LOCATION	ー that a respectable Force may be sent as early as possible in the Spring ー to
Annapolis ー Cumberland	LOCATION	, ー & Windsor ー in which Case they asserted that they would repair to those respective Detachments on the first Alarm of an Invasion ー ready to obey the Orders of the Officers respectively commanding ー As this is a Measure essentially necessary to the Safety of this Province , I think it incumbent on Me to request , that your Excellency may be pleased to grant the Petition of these EnglishMen ー they are loyal ー they are attached to their Country ー I sincerely believe that they will fight in defence of it ー Before I conclude this letter I think it necessary to observe that , as the Inhabitants of this Province are chiefly composed of the
Natives of New Hampshire ー New England ー & Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	ー whose Relations are now in actual Rebellion ー and as the same Principals reign -LSB- line missing -RSB- It would be imprudent in the highest degree to embody the Militia , even on an actual Invasion ー As nineteen out of twenty are Natives of
New England	LOCATION	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, or
Connecticut	LOCATION	, what dependence or reliance could your Excellency have in such Troops ?

		To put a Confidence in such Fellows , would be acting like the Man who cherished a Snake in his bosom , till heated with the warmth of his blood , it bit him to death .

Europe	LOCATION	, but that this Indulgence be not extended longer than 'till the first of April next .

		In the Shippers Letter they mention ー `` You must procure a certificate from the General and Admiral , of the Concords being in the
Government Service	ORGANIZATION	, such as the Glasgow Packet brought with her , which was of great service , procured a Liberty to Arm her which was refused us , also gave her a prefference for some recruits that went out in her . ''

		In another part of this Letter they say , `` Captain
Lowrie	PERSON	will deliver you the contract for the Coals , we gave it to him as perhaps might be of use as a certificate of his Ship being employed in the
Government Service	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Every Letter on board breaths nothing but emmity -LSB- enmity -RSB- to this Country , and a vast number of them there are .

		It is some time since I recommended to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that they would institute a Court for the Trial of Prizes made by the
Continental Armed Vessel	ORGANIZATION	, which I hope they have ere now taken into their consideration , otherwise I should again take the Liberty of urging it in the most pressing manner ... By the last accounts from the Armed Schooners sent to the
River St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, I fear we have but little to expect from them , they were falling short of Provision and mention that they would be obliged to return , which at this
Time	ORGANIZATION	is particularly unfortunate ; as if they chose a proper station , all the Vessells coming down that
River	LOCATION	must fall into their hands .

		The plague , trouble and vexation I have had with the Crews of all the armed Vessels is inexpressible ; I do believe there is not on
Earth	LOCATION	a more disorderly set ; every time they come into Port , we hear of nothing but mutinous
Complaints Manley	ORGANIZATION	's success has lately and but lately quitted his People the Crews of the
Washington	LOCATION	and
Harrison	PERSON	have Actually deserted them , so that I have been under the necessity of ordering the Agent to lay the latter up and get hands for the other on the best Terms he could .

		The House of Representative and the Honr .

		Board have sent me a vote of theirs relative to the Harbour of
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, copy of which you have herewith , I shall send an Officer thither to examine what can be done for its defence , tho ' I do not think I shall be able to give them such Assistance as may be requisite , for I have at present neither Men Powder or Cannon to spare .

		The great want of Powder is what the attention of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should be particularly applied to .

		I dare not attempt any thing offensive , let the temptation or advantage be ever so great , as I have not more of that most essential Article that will be absolutely necessary to defend our Lines , should the Enemy attempt to Attack them ... They are Arming one of the Transports in
Boston	LOCATION	with which they mean to decoy some of our Vessels , as we are apprized of their design , I hope they will be disappointed .

		the late Act & Resolve for fitting out armed Vessels in this

		Yesterday se ` nnight -LSB- November 26 -RSB- a large ship being near the Light off
Cape Ann	LOCATION	was struck with lightning , which set her on fire , and burnt to the water 's edge , 'till she sunk .

		A number of cannon were heard to go off , -LSB- while -RSB- she was on fire , and 't was thought -LSB- first that she was
Jat	ORGANIZATION	least a 20 -LSB- gun -RSB- ship ; but we have an account from

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 4 -LSB- December -RSB- .

		The Admiral wrote again Today to the same Officer 2 inclosing a Letter for Captain -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Bellow	PERSON	-LRB- or Officer commanding the
Kings Ships	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- at
Virginia	LOCATION	, to inform him of the foremcntioned naval Equipments of the Rebels at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the certainty of their hastening to equip more , and the confident Report of their Design to attack his Majesty 's Vessels and Sloops to the Southward ; bidding him therefore be upon his Guard , and keep the Kings Ships together until the Admiral could send him a Reinforcement .

		This Letter was under a flying Seal that Capt :
Parker	PERSON	might be apprized of its Contents , who was directed to forward it by the
Charlotte	LOCATION	, ordering her to return and receive his Dispatches .

		At the same time the Admiral acquainted Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	likewise by Letter with this Intelligence , with the foregoing News from
Canada	LOCATION	, his consequent Resolution to detain the
Asia	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	, and with the Directions he had given to Captain
Parker	PERSON	.

		The
Charlotte	LOCATION	directly sailed to the Southward with these Advices .

		The Hinchinbrook came up to
Boston	LOCATION	Yesterday from a Cruize .

		And late last Night all the Dispatches from the Admiral for
England	LOCATION	were carried aboard the
Boyne	LOCATION	, with Directions for her going forthwith to
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	, and carrying several Land Officers : The Admiral however had ordered 200 Barrels of Gunpowder , some of her Boats , and other Naval , and some
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	to be left behind : her Marines , by Admiralty Order , were wholely landed at
Boston	LOCATION	, notwithstanding the Ships at that time were many short of their Complement .

Halifax	LOCATION	with the
Amity Transport	ORGANIZATION	having on board 83 Seamen raised at
Newfoundland	LOCATION	by order of Rear Admiral -LSB-
Robert -RSB- Duff	PERSON	, upon my application to him of which I informed you by Letter dated 6th of September .

		Commodore
Arbuthnot	PERSON	has kept the Savage at
Halifax	LOCATION	and sent the Transport with part of the Men to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The
Fowey	PERSON	has the Remainder .

		If a Bounty could have been given Mr
Duff	PERSON	informs me many more would have entered , however these are a very good set of Men .

		The Ship Glasgow with 255 Emigrants from
Scotland	LOCATION	, consigned to a Mr
Buchanan	PERSON	-LSB-
Walter & Thomas Buchanan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- Merchant at
New York	LOCATION	, arriving there the latter end of October , Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	in pursuance of my Orders has sent her to
Boston	LOCATION	, where she arrived a few days ago .

		Whatever may be their pretext for leaving
Great Britain	LOCATION	it surely can never be right to continue peopling a Country in absolute Rebellion against us .

		Most of the Men will I believe enlist in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and upon consulting with General
Howe	PERSON	, we are of opinion the rest should be landed at
Halifax	LOCATION	, where a Provision is made by Government for their immediate Subsistance .

		As their own Victuals are expended I am under the necessity of supplying them till they can get to
Halifax	LOCATION	, for which purpose I have ordered the Naval Officer to muster them , and I shall order them to be furnished with as much provision as is requisite for the Voyage according to the allowance in the King 's Service ; and I hope this will meet their Lordship 's Approbation .

		I must intreat their Lordships will be pleased to direct the Commissioners of the victualing to send out Candles and Coals for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	to be supplied to the Pursers as was done last War to the Ships in the
Western Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, Basque Road & c. Ever since April last the prices of Wood , Candles and Coals have been gradually increasing , so that
Wood	PERSON	is here five times , and Candles upwards of three times , dearer than usual , and Coals in proportion , though often not to be had : this occasions great distress among the Pursers , and in the Ships who are but slenderly provided with these necessary Articles .

		I can not therefore avoid representing the peculiar Hardships the Pursers here labour under from the amazing Discount upon Bills ; and doubt not when the whole is properly laid before their Lordships they will obtain Relief .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO PHILIP
STEPHENS Sir Preston Boston Decr	ORGANIZATION	4 , 1775 , By the Sloop General
Gage	PERSON	who left
Quebec	LOCATION	the 9th of November , and arrived the 2d instant at Night , I received a Letter from Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Hamilton	PERSON	of his Majs Ship Lizard , containing very disagreeable Intelligence , of which I think proper to send you a Copy , exactly as represented to me : as I have not the least doubt of the Rebels attempting to take Possession of the Province of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, and seizing and destroying
Halifax Yard	LOCATION	this Winter or very early in the Spring , the
Somerset	LOCATION	can not go home this year , but must remain with the Roebuck for the protection of that Arsenal , until we can collect a greater Force there .

		It is extremely unfortunate that none of the Frigates are yet arrived at
Boston	LOCATION	, many of the Ships with me requiring to be careened and refitted , and some of them to be sent home ; but such is our Situation that it is impossible at present to part with one of them , except the
Boyne	LOCATION	, who draws too much Water for this
Harbour	LOCATION	, and at this Season I can not think of sending her to any other part of the Continent .

		I have this moment received Letters from Captain
Wallace	PERSON	at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, where I find there is a Body of 500 Men voted to be kept in constant Pay , these upon an Alarm to be supported by Minute Men about the Country ; the whole supposed to be about 1000 or 1500 Men , with some pieces of Cannon ; their head Quarters about two Miles from the Town .

		The Inhabitants have tried every method to get these Troops removed from the Island , but have only obtained Orders for their not coming nearer the Town , and for the Towns People to supply the Kings Ships with every thing they want .

		Captain
Wallace	PERSON	is satisfied 't is not in their Power to remove the Troops , who , it appears from many circumstances wish us to destroy the Town .

		Hostilities therefore are suspended against the Town only , and the Market boats are permitted to pass , otherwise the Ships could not be supplied .

		Captain
Wallace	PERSON	says there is certain Intelligence of a Frigate of 36 Guns and two of 20 being at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and that they purpose attacking the Kings Ships at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, then to go down and attack the Ships and Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	at
Virginia	LOCATION	; I dont imagine they will attempt all this , but they appear extremely desirous of doing something by Sea , as well as by La -LCB- id .

		The News Papers herewith transmitted contain very essential Information .

		It is evident from their making it Felony for any one to correspond with the Kings Subjects and other Laws , that they are reducing themselves to Form , with incredible Dispatch , and meditate the most determined resistance .

		The Attack on
Canada	LOCATION	and the Perfidy of the Canadians , who I am credibly informed carried the Cannon of the Rebels down the Rapids , leave no room to doubt their having many Friends in that Province ; it is said the Canadians were not a little influenced in the part they have taken by the Catholicks from
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		The Tempestuous Weather we have lately had ruins all the Ships cruizing on the Coast at this Season .

		It is however necessary to keep Ships out , though at a great risque , in order to protect the Transports , Victualers , Storeships and other Vessels coming with Supplies : but , notwithstanding our utmost Endeavours to the contrary , I fear the
Nancy Brig	PERSON	laden with
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	is taken .

		It is reported she was carried into
Cape Anne	LOCATION	.

		It is much to be lamented that a Cargo of such Consequence should be sent from
England	LOCATION	in a Vessel destitute of Arms even to protect her from a Row Boat .

		An Officer with a
Party of Men	ORGANIZATION	on board would have saved the Vessel .

		I beg humbly to propose that all
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	should come out in good
Ships of Force	ORGANIZATION	well appointed , and constantly have an Officer on board ; for the Ignorance and Obstinacy of Masters of Merchant Ships in disobeying Signals will ever prevent a Convoy keeping together , and too often they part by design , which I greatly fear has been the Case of this Brig , and that the Pilot -LRB- who I hear is an American -RRB- has either betrayed the Master or enticed him to go in with the promise of great Rewards .

		Their Lordships well know the Situation of this Coast in the Winter , the prevailing Winds SE and NW , hard Gales each way , and with the former thick Weather , Rain , Snow , and Ice , without a friendly Port to push for except
Boston	LOCATION	, the Entrance of which is narrow and dangerous ; In this Situation our Cruizers without Exception have been greatly harrassed to prevent being wrecked qr blown off the Coast .

		However their Lordships may be assured that whatever is possible shall be done .

		The
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	's false Keel we find to be athwart , and as it can not be remedied here I shall send her soon to
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		I have dispatched the
Charlotte	LOCATION	with Orders to detain the
Asia	LOCATION	, and have directed Captain
Parker	PERSON	, if both Ships can not lie at
New York	LOCATION	this Winter , to send the
Asia	LOCATION	or go himself to
Virginia	LOCATION	, which shall be found best for the Service .

		As the intended Reinforcements are not yet arrived and there is great Reason to imagine they will be blown off , I hope their Lordships will approve my not sending the
Somerset	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	this Fall .

		The Hope Schooner upon a Survey being taken on her , is found to be rotten and unfit for any further Service ; I have therefore taken the
Brig Sea Nymph	LOCATION	, one of those seized for the King , 2 and am now fitting her for an armed Brig , and shall give her to Lieutenant -LSB-
George -RSB- Dawson	PERSON	as a Reward for his great Diligence , Activity and Zeal for the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		I intended particularly to recommend him to their Lordships if he had gone home , but although his private Affairs press his Return to
England	LOCATION	yet at this time he prefers Serving to every other consideration .

		I can assure their Lordships the preservation of the
Glasgow	LOCATION	last Winter was entirely owing to his determined and Officer-like Conduct .

		The Brig Sea Nymph -LRB- now called the Hope -RRB- was built at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	for a Pacquet , is a remarkable good going Vessel : I beg their Lordships to allow her fifty Men to her Complement , at present I shall establish her like other Brigs with 30 , and lend her Supernumeraries until I hear their pleasure concerning her .

		General

		thus all our Sanguin hopes from

Genel Washington	PERSON	has offered a reward of Ten thousand Pounds to the Crew of any Vessel that brings her in , to any of their Ports .

		We are informed , that the Swan sloop of war , which arrived here from
Boston	LOCATION	yesterday week , lost her best cable and sheet anchor on
Nantucket	LOCATION	shoals , received considerable damage , and was very near foundering ; she was haled in to the wharf at

		MEMOIRS OF
WILLIAM SMITH	PERSON	-LSB-
New York	LOCATION	, December 4 -RSB- The
Council	ORGANIZATION	met on the 4 Decr ー The Business first broke respected the public Records .

		The Governor had already caused such as affected the Crown to be brought on Board Ship from the
Secretary 's Office	ORGANIZATION	as he said upon Intimation that Captain
Sears	PERSON	had formed a Design of carrying them into
New England	LOCATION	as a Pledge for or to compel the Fidelity of this Province in the great -LSB-
Continental -RSB- Association	ORGANIZATION	and he put the Question concerning the Removal of the Rest with strong Assurances , that all should remain sealed be accessible only to the Secretary & when the Danger was over be safely restored to the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		I was struck at this Information and instantly remonstrated against the Removal of any more of the Papers , declaring it was my Opinion that if any Man was hurt by the Loss of the Records the Authors of the Removal would be answerable in Damages and might be ruined .

		The
Council	ORGANIZATION	adopted my opinion but would not concur with another Part of my Advice which was that the Mayor should be apprized of
Sears	ORGANIZATION	's Design that Care might be taken of the Records in Time by the Magistrates if they should think fit to interpose ... Mr.
Tryon	PERSON	now informed us that he intended to acquaint the Public with his Design to return to
England	LOCATION	and that he had prepared a Paper for that Purpose giving Leave to propose Alterations .

		The Clerk read it .


De Lancey	PERSON	said it would neither serve King nor Country -LSB-

Oliver -LSB- Delancey	PERSON	-RSB- grew testy as over-ruled ー I promised nothing certainly from it disliking the Alterations he had made 2 ー It was copied and brought on Shore by the Clerk of the

WILLIAM TRYON	PERSON	TO WHITEHEAD HICKS Sir , Ship Dutchess of

New-York Harbour	PERSON	, 4th Dec. 1775 .

		I desire you will lay before the Corporation the inclosed Paper , containing my Sentiments on the present convulsed State of this Country , and that you will please to make the same public .

		I am , -LSB- & c. -RSB- Wm.
Tryon	PERSON	.

		To the Inhabitants of New-York .

		I Take this public Manner to signify to the Inhabitants of this Province , that his Majesty has been graciously pleased to grant me his Royal Permission , to withdraw from my Government ; and at the same Time to assure them , of my Readiness to perform every Service in my Power , to promote the common Felicity .

		If I am excluded from every Hope of being any Way instrumental towards the re-establishment of that Harmony , at present interrupted , between Great-Britain and her Colonies , I expect soon to be obliged to avail myself of His Majesty 's Indulgence .

		It has given me great Pain , to view the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	committed to my Care , in such a turbulent State , as not to have afforded me , since my Arrival , any Prospect of being able to take the dispassionate an ?

		deliberate Voice of its Inhabitants , in a constitutional Manner , upon the Resolution of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, for composing the present Ferments in this Province : A Resolution that was intended for the basis of an Accommodation , and if candidly considered , in a Way which it will be most probably Successful , and treated with that Delicacy and Decency , requisite to the Cultivation of a sincere Reconciliation and Friendship , might yet be improved , for the Purpose of restoring the general Tranquility and Security of the Empire .

		I owe it to my Affection to this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, to declare my Wish , that some Measure may be speedily adopted for this Purpose ; as I feel an extreme Degree of Anxiety , in being Witness to the growing Calamities of this Country , without the Power to alleviate them .

		ー Calamities that must increase , while so many of the Inhabitants withhold their Allegiance from their Sovereign , and their Obedience to the Parent Country , by whose
Power and Patronage	ORGANIZATION	they have hitherto been sustained and protected .

WILLIAMSBURG	LOCATION	CORRESPONDENT -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Great Bridge	LOCATION	, Dec. 4 , 1775 Since I wrote you , which was about two days ago , we have been well informed that we killed 16 negroes and 5 white men the first day we got to this place .

		The next day , lieutenant -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Tibbs	PERSON	, who had the command of the boat guard , about 5 miles from this place , was attacke.d by a party of the king 's troops , and several negroes , upon which some of our people gave ground ; but
mr. Tibbs	PERSON	, with 4 of his people , maintained his post until I reinforced him with 50 men under capt. -LSB-
George -RSB- Nicholas	PERSON	, who were obliged to pass through a very heavy fire from the enemy .

		Before they got to the place ,
mr. Tibbs	PERSON	had beat off the enemy , and killed 7 of their men , amongst whom was the commander of the party .

		We still keep up a pretty heavy fire between us , from light to light .

		We have only lost two men ; and about half an hour ago one of our people was shot through the arm , which broke the bone near his hand .

		Last night was the first of my pulling off my clothes for 12 nights successively .

		Believe me , my good friend , I never was so fatigued with duty in my whole life ; but I set little value upon my health , when put in competition with my duty to my country , and the glorious cause we are engaged in .

		The
Carolina	ORGANIZATION	forces are joining us .

		One company came in yesterday , and we expect 8 or 900 of them by to-morrow , or next day at farthest , with several pieces of artillery , and plenty of ammunition and other warlike stores .

		ー A gun fired ー I must stop .

		P.S. .

		Since I finished my letter , we saw a large pile of buildings at the far end of this town all in flames , between which and the fort we had 4 sentinels , who can give no account how it happened .

		As I mentioned above , the fire was discovered when the gun fired ; and by the time the men got paraded a volley of small arms was fired from the fort , mixed with now and then a cannon shot .

		About 11 at night it ceased for about half an hour , when , to our great surprise , we saw several other houses in a blaze , which are just now consumed .

		It is now 10 o'clock .

		I shall lie down till the next alarm .

		Sir ー Your letter of the 25th November brought to this board in the recess of -LSB- the Provincial -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, a paper containing `` Articles of agreement for the suspension of hostilities between the enemies of liberty on their part , yourself and Major -LSB-
James -RSB- Mayson	PERSON	on our part , done at Ninety-Six , the 22d of said month ... '' Major
Robinson	PERSON	's messenger , or a person who pretends to be the messenger , and calls himself
Floyd	PERSON	, has appeared before us , and declared that being drunk , he had lost all his papers at

		He was nevertheless extremely anxious to go on board the vessel in which Lord
William -LSB- Campbell	PERSON	-RSB- keeps his court , in order to inform his Lordship verbally all that he can recollect of the contents of the treaty and relative circumstances .

		As this man brought with him no credentials , we might without violation of treaty , not only have refused to grant his request , but also might have imprisoned him as a spy ; but unwilling to take advantages even of those who persevere in acting unjustly and cruelly towards us , we have consented that he shall go to Lord
William	PERSON	, upon this express condition , that his whole conversation with his lordship shall be in the presence and hearing of a witness whom we shall send for that purpose ー this will be no more than equal to unsealed dispatches covenanted for in the 4th article 1 .

SCHUYLER Holland House	LOCATION	Decr 5th near the Heights of

		My Dear General , I have been this Evening favoured with yours of the 19th ult and return you many Thanks for your warm Congratulations .

		Nothing shall be wanting on my Part to reap the Advantage of our good Fortune .

		The Season has proved so favourable as to enable Me to join Col.
Arnold	PERSON	at
Point Aux Trembles	ORGANIZATION	, where I arrived with the Vessels Mr
Prescot	PERSON	made us a Present of .

		They carried the few Troops about 300 which were equipped for a Winter Campaign with the Artillery & c Col.
Livingston	PERSON	is on his Way with some Part of his Regiment of Canadians .

		Mr
Carleton	PERSON	who is I suppose ashamed to
Shew	PERSON	himself in
England	LOCATION	is now in Town , and puts on the
Shew of Defence	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Works of Quebec are extremely extensive and very incapable of being defended .

		His Garrison consists of
McClean	PERSON	's Banditti , the Sailors from the Frigates and other Vessels laid up together with the
Citizens	ORGANIZATION	obliged to take up Arms , most of whom are impatient of the Fatigues of a Seige , and wish to see Matters accommodated amicably .

		propose amusing Mr
Carlton	PERSON	with a formal Attack , erecting Batteries , & ca but mean to insult the Works , I believe towards the lower Town which is the weakest Part .

		I have this Day written to Mr
Carlton	PERSON	, and also to the Inhabitants which I hope will have some Effect .

		I shall be very sorry to be reduced to this Mode of Attack , because I know the melancholy Consequences ; but the approaching Severe Season , and the Weakness of the Garrison together , with the Nature of the Works , point it out too strong to be passed by .

		I find Col.
Arnold	PERSON	's Corps an exceeding fine one , inured to Fatigue , & well accustomed to Cannon Shot -LRB- at
Cambridge	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		There is a Style of Discipline among them much superiour to what I have been used to see this Campaign .

		He himself is active , intelligent , and enterprizing .

		Fortune often baffles the Expectations of poor Mortals .

		I am not intoxicated with the Favours I have received at her Hands , but I do think there is a fair Prospect of Success .

		The Governor has been so kind as to send out of Town many of our Friends who refused to do military Duty , among them several very intelligent Men capable of doing me considerable Service .

		One of them a Mr
Antel	PERSON	-LSB-
Edward Antill	PERSON	-RSB- I have appointed Chief Engineer Mr
Mott	PERSON	& all his Suit having returned home .

		Be so good as to shew
Congress the Necessity	ORGANIZATION	I was under of cloathing the Troops to induce them to stay & undertake this Service at such an inclement Season .

		I think had their
Committee	ORGANIZATION	been with me , they would have seen the Propriety of grasping at every Circumstance in my Power to induce them to engage again .

		I was not without my Apprehensions of not only being unable to make my Appearance here , but even of being obliged to relinquish the Ground I had gained .

		However I hope the Cloathing & Dollar Bounty will not greatly exceed the Bounty offered by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whilst the Affair of
Chamblee	PERSON	was in Agitation , Major
Brown	PERSON	, as I am well informed , made some Promises to the Canadians who engaged on that
Service	ORGANIZATION	, which I believe , I must from Motives of Policy as well as Justice make good ー viz to share the Stores , excepting Ammunition & Artillery ー When Matters are settled I shall pay them in Money , it being inconvenient to part with the Provisions .

		Upon another Occasion also I have ventured to go beyond the Letter of the Law .

		Col.
Easton	PERSON	's Detachment at the Mouth of the Sorrel was employed on the important Service of stopping the Fleet .

		They were half naked , and the Weather was very severe .

		I was afraid that not only they might grow impatient and relinquish the Business in Hand , but I also saw the Reluctance of the Troops at
Montreal	LOCATION	shewed to quit it .

		By way of Stimulant , I offered as a Reward all public Stores taken in the Vessels , to the Troops who went forward , Except Ammunition and Provisions .

		-LSB-
Seth	PERSON	-RSB-
Warner	ORGANIZATION	's
Corps	ORGANIZATION	refused to march , or at least declined it .

		-LSB-
Timothy -RSB- Bedel	PERSON	's went on and came in for a Share of the
Labour & Honour	ORGANIZATION	.

		I hope the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will not think this Money laid out .

		With a Year 's cloathing of the 7th & 26th I have relieved the Distresses of
Arnold 's Corps	ORGANIZATION	, and forwarded the Cloathing of some other Corps .

		The greatest Part of that Cloathing is a fair Prize , except such as immediately belonged to Prisoners taken on Board .

		They must be paid for theirs as it was their own Property .

		We shall have more
Time	ORGANIZATION	hereafter to settle this Affair .

		Should there be any Reason to apprehend an Effort next Spring to regain
Canada	LOCATION	, I would not wish to see less than Ten Thousand Men ordered here .

		The Canadians will be our Friends as long as we are able to maintain our Ground , but they must not be depended upon , especially for defensive Operations .

		The great Distance from any Support or Relief renders it in my opinion , absolutely necessary , to make the most formidable Preparations for the Security of this important Province , What Advantages the Country below
Quebec	LOCATION	affords for Defence , I can not yet assert , but the Rapids of
Richlieu	LOCATION	some Miles above may be defended agt all the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	and all the military
Force of Great Britain	LOCATION	by such a Body of Troops as I have mentioned provided with sufficient Artillery Row Gallies , & proper Vessels fitted for Fire Ships .

		Some Time since you desired a Return from General
Wooster	PERSON	of the Men he has discharged between
Albany & Tyonderoga	ORGANIZATION	.

		I was afraid there might be something disagreeable to him in the Desire , & as it was too critical a Time to put any Body out of Humour , I therefore suppressed it .

		I shall now make him acquainted with your Pleasure on that Head .

		There are several Appointments I have thought necessary to make , which I shall soon make known to You .

		I hope the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will not yield to any Solicitations to the Prejudice of the Troops who have bore the Burthen of the service here .

		I have paid particular Attention to Recommendations of Col.
Arnold	PERSON	.

		Indeed , I may say , he has brought with him many pretty young Men .

		I do n't know whether I informed you that it was in vain to think of engaging the Troops for twelve Months .

		The 15th of April which allows them Time to plant their Corn upon returning home , was all I dared to ask .

		I hope the proper Measures will be taken for sending fresh Troops into the Country before that
Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		1775 My Lord Since my last letters , by this same conveyance , We have advice by the way of
Boston	LOCATION	, that
Montreal	LOCATION	is in the hands of the Rebels , that they were assisted by the Canadians in this attempt , and supplied by them with Provisions ; I have only to add , that
Canada	LOCATION	being in the hands of the Rebels , will deprive to Province of every resourse for supplying the
Army	ORGANIZATION	,
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and the Inhabitants of this Colony with Bread ; and the only supplies of Provision are to be had from
Great-Britain	LOCATION	, and
Ireland	LOCATION	, and your Lordship will be convinc 'd of the Rectitude of the Measure of sending the quantity of Provision , to arrive here early in the Spring ; which will be the safest time , and Vessels have arriv 'd here the beginning of March .

		My Reason for urging this Measure , is , that the Americans have fitted out Vessels of War , and have lately been cruising in these Seas , and intercepted sev eral Vessels , bound from
Europe	LOCATION	to
Boston	LOCATION	, two Arm 'd Schooners were for some time in the
Harbour of Canso	LOCATION	, and carried of -LSB- f -RSB- several Vessels belonging to this Province , whose Crews landed on the Island of St
John	PERSON	's , and carried off Mr Colebuck -LSB-

Island	LOCATION	, and several Officers of Government ; and I hear a twenty Gun Ship from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	has been Cruising in the mouth of St Lawrence Gulph between
Cape Breton	LOCATION	and

Times	ORGANIZATION	conversed with General Gates on the Subject & this Afternoon he promised that the Vessell should be compleated furnished with Cannon in abt 18 or 20 Days if I am not disappointed in this , nothing can prevent my going on with the Plan of arming the Schooner as I mentioned to you last Saturday ー Therefore would be glad you would inform me By the Bearer wether it would be agreeable to you to take about a sixth or an eighth Part of the Schooner ー 2 The amount of the Cost of the Vessell , arming & fixing of her compleately with 12 or 14 6 & 4

		The sales catalogue extract which President
Franklin D. Roosevelt	PERSON	acquired with the letter states that it relates to the '' Yankee Hero , '' the first privateer of the Revolution .

		However , it was not the first , nor is it likely that the vessel referred to in the letter became the Yankee Hero , as the latter was a brig , not a schooner .

		The Yankee Hero was not commissioned until January 13 , 1776 , and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	had privateers at sea during December 1775 .

		At the same time , it is clear that the group of which
Nathaniel Tracy	PERSON	was a part sent the Yankee Hero to sea .

		Thus , it would seem that the statement in the sales catalogue is not entirely in error since the efforts described did lead to the sailing of the
Yankee Hero	ORGANIZATION	.

		1775 The letter you did me the honor of writing me dated October 19th ー came to hand but a few days past ー the notice taken of me by the
Committee of Congress	ORGANIZATION	appointed to collect an account of hostilities & c. I own myself indebted to you for , and you may be assured that I shall do every thing in my power to forward that business : A
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of both Houses of which I am one has been appointed in consequence of the

Selectmen & Committees of Correspondence	ORGANIZATION	in the several towns where hostilities have been committed , that we may be able to furnish your
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, with a collected account of the damages sustained in those towns .

		Is a sea coast of above 2000 Miles extent from whence two hundred sail of Privateers might this winter by the way of foreign ports at least , be launched out upon the British trade , still -LSB- to -RSB- be held in a state of neutrality under a notion that we are opposing Ministry & not the People of
Britain	LOCATION	, while our enemies are employing the whole force of the Nation to plunder and ruin us ー If the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	remain silent on this head , will they take it amiss if a
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, the first in suffering as well as exertions , should grant letters of Reprisal to those Persons only who have had their property seized & destroyed by the Enemy .

		I some time ago ventured a prophesy , that it would not be long before we realized our importance as a Maritim power , and the success attending our first Naval enterprises , are very encouraging presages of what is yet to come ー but if weak nerves and large estates should opperate to the preventing the whole force of the Colonies being exerted against the common enemy , the issue of so unequal & unheard of a war , may be easily augur 'd .

JONATHAN TRUMBULL	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Decembr	PERSON	5th , 1775 .

		This Colony has now in the
River	LOCATION	fourteen armed Galleys , with near seven hundred men on board ; 2 and we are informed by their
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	, which has sat daily for the last six months , that their expenses have amounted to more than fifty thousand pounds , which they expect to bear as a
Colony	ORGANIZATION	charge .

		Should they alter their opinion , the expense of our Armed Vessels might then be urged for , with greater propriety ; indeed we consider it a probable method to have them paid for , to get them into
Continental	ORGANIZATION	service , but your Honor will remember , that , at the time they were applied for , they were reported to be unfit for the Eastern service .

		3 The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are now fitting out with all possible dispatch a number of armed Vessels , and though the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	have engaged the number already ordered , yet it is our opinion , more especially Mr.
Deane	PERSON	's , who attends that
Board	ORGANIZATION	, that if the Minerva shall be judged staunch and fit for service , that she may be employed by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Wish your Honor to write on this subject in your next , as the season advances , and our fleet must sail soon .

		Capt.
Whipple	PERSON	has joined them , this day , and is taken into
Continental	ORGANIZATION	service ... 4
The Naval Committee	ORGANIZATION	will be in want of seamen and marines : if therefore , the
Briga	PERSON	in Colony service will , on refitting , bear a survey , and can be warranted sound and staunch for service , Mr.
Deane	PERSON	thinks the
Naval Committee	ORGANIZATION	would employ her to bring round Seamen and Stores to this place ; but this must beresolved on immediately , as before hinted .

South West	LOCATION	and hazy Weather at 3 o'clock , p.m. they saw a schooner bearing
East South East	LOCATION	, laying by ; as soon as they perceived we discovered them , they made all the sail they could after us & came up with us very fast ; we tack 'd ship & stood to the southward , & they made after us , & then we discovered a large topsail schooner standing right across us , we being then in
Campa	LOCATION	with a
Briga	PERSON	commanded by

English Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and
Deponents	ORGANIZATION	then made all possible sail for the land ; abt 5 o'clock p.m. they made the Vineyard , the Tenders still chasing them , about 7 o'clock p.m. the water being shoal the Tenders were afraid to venture , & stood off again , Capt.
Kendrick	PERSON	's being so close that he came to an anchor , but these Deponents taking a Pilot from him , they beat off all night with the wind still at
South West	LOCATION	, & finding the Tenders waiting for their getting off into the sound , they , abt 5 o'clock a.m. bore away to go thro ' Marthas Vineyard and Miseket , so called , by which they expected to clear the Enemy ; abt 8 o'clock the Brige struck upon a
Shoal	ORGANIZATION	called Hoses Shoal ?

Bales of Cotton	ORGANIZATION	, ten Hogsheads of Rum , but lost all the Sugar ; wherefore these Deponents protest against the said English cruisers or Tenders as the sole & only cause of the said misfortune & further these Deponents say not ; and I the said Notary at the Request of these Deponents did & do hereby protest against the said Cruisers or Tenders by whomsoever they may be commanded in behalf of these Deponents & the Insurers , Passengers or Freighters , owner or Interested in the said

		The date on which the

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	, DEC. 6 . ''

		We have just to hand , by express from
Virginia	LOCATION	, that
Dunmore	PERSON	had issued a proclamation , declaring all Negroes and servants free that belonged to men in arms for the defence of their country ; 2 that he had beat the Provincials in two skirmishes ; the particulars are only known to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which we fear are not very favourable .

		Great numbers of people , white and black , had repaired to the King 's standard , which he had hoisted .

		As there are in
Norfolk	LOCATION	many of his sc -LSB- oundrel -RSB- ly countrymen , English Tories , and others , no better , and thro ' the country , in the neighbouring counties of Aromack -LSB- Accomac -RSB- ,
Hampton	PERSON	, and others on the western shore , many gentlemen wavering , we should not wonder at their being awed to follow this Jacobite Scotch fortunist to their ruin .

		Little do they or he know what force we are preparing .

		All the
Virginia	LOCATION	and
North Carolina	LOCATION	troops are in full march against him ; and for fear they may not be able to follow these vagabonds , traitors to their country , from river to river , as he may proceed with the assistance of his vessels , we are fitting out here a number of ships with the greatest expedition to attack him ; they will sail , or at least fall down the river in a few days , viz. .

		The
Black Prince	PERSON	, a fine vessel , I believe you know her well , she carries a flag , 3 and mounts from twenty to thirty twelve and sixteen pounders , besides swivels , and fights them mostly under deck .

		Two stout , fast sailing brigs , a sixteen gun sloop , just arrived from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, with one or two other ships not yet in commission ; the Admiral and Commanders are all determined on , but not publickly known .

		Other ships will join our fleet in
Cheropeak	LOCATION	-LSB-
Chesapeake	LOCATION	-RSB-
Bay	LOCATION	, from
Baltimore	LOCATION	town ... .

		there is but little doubt of our united forces soon giving a good account of
Dunmore	PERSON	, which we pray most ardently for .

		We have nothing to fear but from the
Asia	LOCATION	, a sixty gun ship , lying at
New York	LOCATION	, that the Captain may have information of the destination of our fleet , and endeavour to interrupt them at our Capes .

		Hell itself could not have vomited any thing more black than his design of emancipating our slaves ; and unless he is cut off before he is reinforced , we know not how far the contagion may spread ... .

		Though we look on ourselves quite safe here .

		Our frigates , and our fort , which is a regular one , on Mud Island , was planned , and partly executed by
-LSB- Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	's Engineer , Capt.
Montresure	PERSON	-LSB-
John Montresor	PERSON	-RSB- .

		Our ballast vessels and
Chevaux de Frise	PERSON	, at the narrows and flats , will be very sufficient to defeat any ship that may attempt to annoy us .

RICHARD HENRY	PERSON	LEE TO GEORGE

Philadelphia	LOCATION	6th Decr 1775 Dear Sir The inclosed letter from
Colo -LSB- Edmund -RSB- Pendleton	PERSON	came to hand two days ago , and as it will save a good deal of unneccessary writing , I send it to you .

		The proclamation there alluded to , we have seen .

		It proclaims martial law thro
Virginia	LOCATION	and offers freedom to all the Slaves , calling their Masters rebels & c ー It seems this unlucky triumph over -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Hutchings	PERSON	with his less than half armed
Militia	ORGANIZATION	, so dispirited the miserable wretches in that neighborhood , that many have taken an oath of Ld Dunmores prescribing , reprobating
Congress Committees &	ORGANIZATION	c ー Long before this ,
Colo Woodford	PERSON	with 800 good men , must be arrived in those parts , and I make no doubt has forced his Lordship on board his Ships again .

		All this would have been prevented , if our troops could have crossed
James River	LOCATION	in proper time , but they were obstructed & forced to march high up by the Men of War , and indeed , such is the nature of our water intersected Country , that a small number of men provided with Naval force , can harrass us extremely .

		I have good reason to hope , that in a few weeks , the state of things in
Virginia	LOCATION	will be greatly altered for the better .

		I thank you for your list of Armed Vessels , but at present no use can be made of them .

		I hope some of them will be fortunate enough to meet with prizes eastward .

		LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- No 34 -RRB- On Board the
Ship Dunmore	LOCATION	off
Norfolk Virginia	LOCATION	6th December 1775 My Lord Since my letter -LRB- No 33 -RRB- in which I informed your Lordship that Mr
Mitchel	PERSON	the Collector of the Lower district of
James River	LOCATION	had made his Escape to this place , Mr
Bradley	PERSON	the Comptroller has done the same , but Mr
-LSB- Archibald	PERSON	-RSB- Cary the Naval Officer has accepted of the Command of the Rebels at
Hampton	LOCATION	, and now Acts as such there .

		I have as I informed your Lordship I would , appointed one in his place , and Captain
-LSB- Edward -RSB- Foy	PERSON	is the person I have pitched upon , but he being now in
England	LOCATION	I have procured a proper person to Act for him in his absence , I hope Captain
Fay	PERSON	's former Services in
Germany	LOCATION	, as well as those he has rendered his Country here , will ensure him this
Mark of His Majesty	PERSON	's favour , I think at the same time my own Services gives me Sufficient reason to expect that my recommendation should have some Weight .

		On the 27th of October some of the King 's Tenders went pretty Close into
Hampton Road	LOCATION	, so soon as the Rebels perseived them they marched out against them , and the moment they got within Shot of our People Mr
George Nicholas	PERSON	, Lord
North	PERSON	's late Comptroller of the upper district of
James River	LOCATION	, who commanded the party of Rebels at that time at
Hampton	LOCATION	, fired at one of the Tenders , whoes example was followed by his whole party , the Tenders returned the fire but without the least effect , but next day the Tenders returned again to the
Creek	LOCATION	, and ran up very near to the Town , the Rebels being reinforced , and taking possession of the Houses , made a very heavy fire upon them , but only killed one or two of the men , and wounded several others , took a Pilot Boat , that the Gentlemen of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	had made a Tender of , and made Seven Men prisoners , belonging to the Otter that were in her , the loss of the Rebels must have been very inconsiderable if they suffered at all , the Tenders were towed out of the
Creek	LOCATION	by the boats with some difficulty .

		These overt Acts of Rebellion determined me to Issue the inclosed Proclamation , -LRB- No 1 -RRB- which however I postponed as long as possible , in hopes of having Instructions from your Lordship for my Conduct , in this as well as in many other matters I have so often prayed to be instructed in , for many Months past , but not one line have I had the Honor to receive from your Lordship since yours of the 30th of May .

		God only knows what I have suffered since my first embarking , from my anxiety of mind , not knowing how to act in innumerable instances that occur every day , being one moment deffident of my own judgement -LRB- and not having one liveing Soul to advise with -RRB- and then on the other hand fearing if I remained a Tame Spectator and permitted the Rebels to proceed without any interuption , that they would by persuasion , threats , and every other art in their power , delude many of His Majesty 's well disposed Subjects to their party , then again it occurred to me that should I be able to prevail on only a few to espowse His Majesty 's Cause -LRB- with the very small force I had to support them -RRB- I should only involve them in inevitable ruin , should the Rebels march a body against us that we were not able to withstand , in this Situation was my mind when I was informed that a hundred and twenty or thirty
North Carolina	LOCATION	Rebels had marched into this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, to a place Called the
Great Bridge	LOCATION	, about Ten Miles from hence , and a very Strong Post , in order to join some of ours assembled not far from thence , this I was determined not to Suffer , I accordingly embarked in the Night in boats , with all of the 14th Regiment that were able to do Duty , to the amount of 109 Rank and file , with 22 Volunteers from
Norfolk	LOCATION	, the
Carolina People	ORGANIZATION	had fled the Evening before , but hearing at the Bridge that there were between three and four hundred of our Rebels Assembled at a place called
Kemps	LOCATION	landing , Nine or Ten Miles from the Bridge , I was then determined to disperse them if possible , we accordingly Marched thither immediately , and about a Mile from the place our advanced party were fired upon by the Rebels , from a thicket , before our People discovered them , I immediately ordered the main Body , who were within two or three hundred paces to advance , and then detached a party with the Volunteers to outflank them , at the same time the advanced Guard with the Grenadiers rushed into the Woods , the Rebels fled on all quarters , we pursued them above a Mile , four or five were killed , a good many wounded and Eighteen taken Prisoners on that and the following day , a more particular Account of this is in the inclosed
Virginia Gazette	ORGANIZATION	, -LRB- No 2 -RRB- which is the first of our publishing , the good effects of this most trifeling Success was manifested strongly by the Zeal which the People shewed on this occasion to His Majesty 's Service when unawed by the opposite party , I was immediately determined to run all risques for their support , and on that very day ordered the inclosed Proclamation to be published , erected the Kings Standered -LRB- Alias a pair of Colours as I had no better -RRB- and the next day , I suppose not less than a hundred of those very Men who were forced into the field against me the day before , came and took the inclosed Oath -LRB- No 3 -RRB- -LRB- which I drew up for the occasion :-RRB- Your Lordship may observe that about three thousand have taken that Oath , but of this Number not above three or four hundred at most are in any degree capable of bearing Arms , and the greatest part of these hardly ever made use of the Gun , but I hope a Short time -LRB- if they are willing -RRB- will make them as good if not better than those who are come down to oppose them ; the Numbers of the Rebels now on their March , are uncertain ; the Bridge abovementioned is by Nature a very Strong Pass , and the only one by which they can enter
Princess Anne County	LOCATION	by land , and a great part of
Norfolk County	LOCATION	, I immediately ordered a Fort to be erected there , and put an Officer with 25 of the 14th Regiment to Garrison it , with about as many Volunteers , and about Fifty Negroes , whom I now Arm and discipline as fast as they come in ; the Fort has been beseiged by between Seven or eight hundred of the Rebels for these eight days past , without hitherto doing us the least damage , except wounding one or two Men very Slightly ; by the best Ac.counts I have been able to procure , the Rebels must have lost from 15 to 20 killed ; they have made many attempts to Cross the Branch on Rafts , but thank God we have hitherto always repulsed them .

		I am now endeavouring to raise two Regiments , one of White People -LRB- Called the
Queens	LOCATION	own
Loyal Virginia Regiment	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the other of Negroes -LSB- -LRB- -RSB- Called Lord Dunmores Ethiopian Regiment . -RRB-

		I wrote to your Lordship in one of my former Letters that I had taken Ships into His Majesty 's Service , as also Sloops and Schooners as Tenders , all of which I am now Arming as well as I can ; So your Lordship sees I am equiping a fleet , raising an
Army	ORGANIZATION	and all this without any order from your Lordship , or any other person , but if I have done wrong the blame must not be laid at my door , I have prayed and intreated your Lordship over and over again for Instructions , but not one Syllable from your Lordship for these Six Months past .

		Yes , sir .

		Mr.
Innes	PERSON	then addressed himself to Lord

		Lord

Lady William	PERSON	was denied to come down .

		And Mr.
Innes	PERSON	went on board the Scorpion .

		Mr.

William	PERSON	came upon deck , telling me , that he must detain me a little longer ; then he also went on board the Scorpion .

		After his Lordship had left the ship , the surgeon gave
Floyd	PERSON	and myself an invitation to walk down and drink somewhat ー but before we had drank ,
Floyd	PERSON	was sent for by Mr.
Innes	PERSON	, who was then alone in the cabin .

		I remained a few minutes with the surgeon , then went upon deck .

		In the mean time Capt.
Ferguson	PERSON	had gone down , who sent me an invitation which I accepted , and I remained in the cabin , with him , Mr.
Innes	PERSON	and
Floyd	PERSON	until Lord
William	PERSON	returned -LRB- with
Mr. Trail	LOCATION	-RRB- from on board the Scorpion about seven o'clock at night , or later ー when his Lordship came along-side , we all went upon deck .

		His Excellency immediately went down ー Mr.

Innes	PERSON	returned , saying to me , ` my Lord desires you will return , and inform the persons who sent you , that as the other person is a messenger from a friend to government , he must detain him until he had determined on a proper answer . '

		PETITION OF
PHILLIP CALLBECK	PERSON	AND THOMAS WRIGHT The Case of
Phillip Callbeck	PERSON	late commander in Chief of the Island St
John	PERSON	and
Thomas Wright	PERSON	one of the Council , Justice of the peace , and Surveyor General of said Island : ー Addressed to His Excellency General
Washington	LOCATION	ー That on Friday the 17th of November two armed Schooners or Privateers arrived at
Charlotte Town	LOCATION	the Capital of the said
Island	LOCATION	, immediately after Captain
Broughton	PERSON	and
Selmon	PERSON	who commanded said Vessels landed with two parties under their command ; ー That Mr Call beck met Captain
Selmon	PERSON	on his landing , who notwithstanding a very Civil reception immediately order 'd him on board his Vessel without permitting him to return to his
House	ORGANIZATION	though requested so to do .

		ー That as he was going on board one of the party insultingly without any provocation struck him .

		ー That immediately after Mr
Calbeck	PERSON	was conveyed on board he received a messuage from Captain
Salmon	PERSON	to send the
Keys of his house Stores	ORGANIZATION	& c otherways he would break the Doors open ー on the receipt of this messuage Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	instantly sent the Keys with one of his Clerks -LRB- who was detained a prisoner -RRB- that he might attend and opeh the doors of such places as the Captains choose to inspect , upon the Clerks informing him of Mr
Callbecks	PERSON	directions , the Captain told him he did not want his assistance , and desired him to deliver the Keys which he accordingly did .

		ー That Captains
Broughton	PERSON	and
Selmon	PERSON	with their party immediately proceeded to a Store in which were a large assortment of Goods all of which except some Earthenware they sent on board Captain 's Selmons Vessel after which -LRB- although they had the Keys of the doors -RRB- they broke open two other stores out of which they took the most Valuable articles together with the entire stock of provisions that Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	had provided for his Familys winter support and the Inhabitants immediately about him .

		ー After which they went into Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	's dwelling house where they examined all his private papers and broke the Bed chamber 's Closets and cellar doors open though they had all the Keys .

		ー In
Mrs Callbeck	PERSON	's bed room they broke open her drawers and Trunks scatter 'd her Cloaths about read her Letters from her Mother and Sisters , took the Bed and window curtains , also the Bed & bedding , and they or some of the party took
Mrs Callbeck	PERSON	's Rings Bracelets Buckles and Trinkets , also some of their Cloaths .

		After which they took the parlour window Curtains Looking Glasses Carpets and several articles of plate , and to accomplish the whole , they took out of Mr
Callbe	PERSON	-LSB- ck 's -RSB- cellar all his Wine , porter , Rum ,
Geneva	LOCATION	and Cordials ; except one cask of Wine which they stove the head in and drank the whole out ー They also took
Mrs Callbeck	PERSON	's little stores of
Vinegar Oil Candles	ORGANIZATION	, Fruit , sweetmeats , Hams ,
Bacon	PERSON	& c. ー Notwithstanding they having done what is here related , they next went to Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	's Office , from which they took two Trunks full of Goods .

		ー His Clerk 's Desk and wearing apparel ー After which they open 'd Mr
Callbecks Bureau	ORGANIZATION	and Desks read all his pap -LSB- ers -RSB- some of which were of great importance in his private connexions .

		They also took the province silver Seal weight 59 ounces , Gov -LSB- ernor -RSB- patterson 's Commission some of Mr
Callbecks Cloaths	PERSON	, all his Shoes & c That after they had ravaged Mr
Callbecks	PERSON	house and out Houses , they broke into Governor
Patterson	PERSON	's
House	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- in which no person resided -RRB- out of which they took his Window curtains , Carpets Looking Glasses , Cases of Knives & forks Silver spoons & c & c. ー Broke some of the
China	LOCATION	and suffer 'd their Men to drink what liquors they found in the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー That after they had accompliced thus far of their Cruelty , they took Mr
Wright	PERSON	into custody and brought him on board the Vessel where Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	was confined and to keep pace with their barbarity Captain
Selmon	PERSON	order 'd his party to go in to take Mr
Wright	PERSON	from the arms of his Wife and Sister , and insultingly smiled at the Tears and Lamentations of Women who were in the greatest distress , being seperated from their Husband and Brother .

		ー That after Mr
Wright	PERSON	came on board he and Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	represented the treatment they had received , the confidence they had that the Captains had no orders to commit such outrag -LSB- es -RSB- and they in order to justify themselves read your Excellencys instructions by which it appear 'd they were not directed to go to the Island and that your Excellency had particularly cautioned them not to abuse private property ; upon which Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	wi -LSB- th -RSB- Mr
Wright	PERSON	labour 'd all in their power to convince them of their not having in any respect conformed to their instructions , they further represented the Cruelty of taking them away for tho ' it was probable they would be imediately dismissed , yet it would be almost impossible for them to get back to the
Island	LOCATION	before the Winter set in , the Season being then so far advanced , notwithstanding they determined to take Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	-LRB- and his Effects -RRB- and Mr
Wright	PERSON	ー That Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	supposes they have in their custody of his property to the amount of two thousand pounds sterling ー to exaggerate the cruel treatment he has received is impossible and it is equally so even to give an exact detail of the injuries that have been offered to him and his property ー His papers all read some of which were of a very private nature ー Notwithstanding they had all his Keys , his Doors broke open , his Effects taken away the provisions and necessaries he had provided for his Families support taken away and , wantonly destroyed ー His Wife left destitute of every support , also between 70 and 80 people who were lately arrived on the
Island	LOCATION	and depended on Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	for their support during the Winter will in all probabillity Starve .

		ー By Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	's being taken away he is debarred from assisting
Mrs Callbeck	PERSON	who is left without any support , not so much as a Candle to burn beside the necessity of taking the necessary care of what remains of a shatter 'd Fortune ; what has been left of his property on the
Island	LOCATION	is in the hands of Servants who doubtless will be neglectfull and perhaps avail themselves under the depr -LSB- a -RSB- dations that has been committed on his property by alleging several of his effects which they will choose to plunder were taken away by the Captains ー The Captains by their conduct have left Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	open to these apprehensions for altho ' it was urged and requested by his Clerks that an Inventory should be taken of the Effects the Captains took away ー They would not permit it nor would they suffer the Clerks to stand by while they were taking the , things away , and to make the matter still more , doubtfull and to give the inhabitants an opportunity to plunder , the Captains after they apprehended Mr
Wright	PERSON	suffer 'd some of their people to remain on Shore -LRB- without an Officer -RRB- who broke a second time into Governor
Patterson	PERSON	and Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	's Houses and took out of them what they pleased , and finished what LiquGrs that had been left in both Houses .

		ー That during their Voyage some articles of Plat -LSB- e -RSB- and other of Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	's property were found in the custody of some of the Marines , so that even upon a supposition that Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	should be order 'd his property , he will doubtless be a considerable looser .

		ー That Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	and
Wright	PERSON	thus wantonly torn from their Families have been brought in a state of
Captivity	LOCATION	upwards of 600 Miles by Sea to this province , during their passage they nave suffer 'd many inconveniences and since their landing they have travelled 120 miles , part of which -LRB- from portsmouth to
Lyne	PERSON	-RRB- they travelld without any Guard .

		ー That at
Medford	LOCATION	the Officer who met them at
Lyne	PERSON	and was conducting them to your Excellency insisted that they should attend him as his Prisoners and if it was not for Colonel
Tompsons	PERSON	humane interposition , they suppose they would have been treated as Captives whose deserts merited the worst usage ー That Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	and
Wright	PERSON	have taken the Liberty to trouble your Excellency with the state of their Case , in order to be releived in such manner as to your Excellency shall appear reasonable which will confer a lasting obligation on them who are with respect ー Sir your Excellency 's -LSB- & c. -RSB-

BENJAMIN GALE	PERSON	TO
SILAS DEANE	PERSON	-LSB- Extract -RSB-
Killingworth	LOCATION	, 7th Dec. , 1775 .

		Dear Sir , ー According to your request I wrote you sometime since respecting our machine , 2 supposing it was gone to the eastward .

		On finding that on proof of the navigation one instrument failed performing what was expected from it I then by letter acquainted you the proceeding was delayed until that could be repaired ; which when done , another proof has been made which answers well , and every trial made requisite to the attempt respecting navigation , and everything answers well , but still , he fails on one account .

		He proposes going in the night , on account of safety .

		He always depends on fox-wood , which gives light in the dark , to fix on the points of the needle of his compass , and in his barometer , by which he may know what course to steer and the depth he is under water , both which are absolute necessity for personal safety of the navigator ; but he now finds that the frost wholly destroys that quality in that wood , of which he was before ignorant , and for that reason and that alone he is obliged to desist .

		He was detained near two months for want of money , and before he could obtain it the season was so far advanced he was , in the manner I have now related , frustrated .

		I write you this with two views , first that you and those to whom you may have communicated what I wrote , may not think I have imposed upon you an idle story , and in the next place to have you enquire of Dr.
Franklin	PERSON	wr he knows of any kind of phosphorus which will give light in the dark and not consume the air .

		He has tried a candle , but that destroys the air so fast he can not remain under water long enough to effect the thing .

		This you may rely upon , he has made every requisite experiment in proof of the machine , and it answers expectations ; what I mentioned above is only wanting ... The person , the inventor of this machine , now makes all his affairs a secret even to his best friends , and I have liberty to communicate this much from him only with a view to know if Dr.
Franklin	PERSON	knows of any kind of phosphorus that will answer his purpose ; otherwise the execution must be omitted until next spring , after the frosts are past .

		I am therefore to request your strictest silence in that matter .

		I am Sir , your humble servant

		We also took a view of
Pooploop	PERSON	's kill , and found its situation the best by much for any defensive works in the Highlands .

		A little to the north of the house on the hill , is a place where a battery of heavy cannon would obstruct an enemy 's coming up , as it commands the river , down and up , the length of point blank shot .

Charleston	LOCATION	-RSB- , Thursday Dec. 7th , 1775 .

		Mr President laid before the Council the following copies of letters which he had dispatched this morning , by
George Dittinger	PERSON	:
Charles-Town	PERSON	, Dec. 6th , 1775 .

		Gentlemen ー Having received information , that through sickness of some and absence of other members of your board , the intended repairs at
Fort Lytleton	LOCATION	are scarcely yet begun ; and knowing the necessity for putting that place in the best state of defence without further delay , we have judged it necessary , and have accordingly resolved , that Col.
Stephen Bull	PERSON	,
Thos	PERSON	.


Rutledge	PERSON	, and
Nath	PERSON	' l
Barnwell	PERSON	, esqs. , be added to your present number , which we desire you will immediately notify to those gentlemen , and summon a board in order to expedite the work above mentioned , and to carry into execution such other matters as we shall hereafter recommend .

		The Scorpion sloop of war lately arrived in
Rebellion-Road	LOCATION	, having under her command a large transport ship , has been at
Bermuda	LOCATION	, and at
Cape-Fear	LOCATION	, from each place she brought off all the cannon that could be taken , and we learn that Capt.
Tollemache	PERSON	has orders to seize the cannon wherever he can in all the colonies ; no doubt therefore , but that
Beaufort	LOCATION	will be the next visited , and we are the more apprehensive of this from a seizure of two
Bermuda	LOCATION	sloops , which was made yesterday by the commodore , one of which has hoisted a pendant , from whence we conclude she is put in commission .

		From these and other considerations , we recommend that without a minute 's delay you cause all the cannon belonging to the fort or town , to be secured by removing them to a distance out of the reach of a man of war 's guns and under the protection of a proper body of militia , or even by burying them , if the enemy suddenly approach .

		The King 's ships which are at present among us , have no men to spare for enterprizes on land , but if they can work under the protection of their own , they will certainly carry off your cannon .

		We also recommend , that you proceed with all possible dispatch to repair the fort according to the plan first adopted by the late
Council of Safety	ORGANIZATION	, by which the platform was to have been of pine plank , which will certainly be most expeditiously performed and expedition is aboslutely necessary ; you will erect platforms and mount gun after gun , as you shall be in readiness , two or three or even one of your heaviest cannon , we apprehend may be fired to such advantage as will deter a transport vessel , or even the Scorpion , whose cannon are very light , from attempting to , advance .

		Powder for immediate use in case of need must be had from the six hundred pounds lodged in the hands of the committee at
Beaufort	LOCATION	, and we hope that before you have mounted all of your cannon , we shall receive such supplies as will enable us to lay in a proper magazine for the fort 's use .

		By order of the Council of Safety .

		Your attention to this notice will be of great moment to the common cause , therefore 't is particularly enjoined and required .

Great Britain	LOCATION	, in order the more effectually , as you said , to execute the commission of shipping off the produce of this colony for continental service , and that such permission was peremptorily refused .

		We have therefore reflected upon your application for the same purpose to this board , and although we did not grant your request as being out of our department , we think it necessary to add , to such observations as were then made , our desire and injunction , that you will not attempt to clear out any vessel for
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, or the British West-Indies .
