GEORGE GERMAIN Camp	PERSON	on
Howe	PERSON	dated at
Howe	PERSON	's letter , it did not appear that he expected or called upon me for any immediate assistance at the opening of the Campaign , nor did he name either the time or place of joining him , but rather seemed on the contrary to intimate his wishes that some operations might take place in some of the Southern Colonies , and pointed out
Charles Town	PERSON	in the Province of
Sulivan	PERSON	's Island -LRB- the Key to
Charles Town	PERSON	harbour -RRB- were in an imperfect and Unfinished state , I was induced to acquiesce in a proposal made to me by the Commodore 2 to attempt the reduction of that Fortress by a Coup de main ; I thought it possible at the same time that it might be followed by such immediate Consequences as \ yould prove of great advantage to His Majesty 's service .
Howe	PERSON	with my whole Force , leaving however a Regt or two if the purpose therein referred to could be effected , '' and being of opinion that the object before e came within your Lordships description , and might be soon accomplished , I came to a determination to proceed .
Cornwallis	PERSON	agreed with me in opinion that he could not more effectually Co-operate with the intended movements of the Fleet than by taking possession of
Sulivan	PERSON	's Island by a ford passable at low water , and with the main by creeks navigable for boats of draft ; this was accordingly done and our whole force assembled there on the 18th of June excepting a few recruits , who were left on board the transports by way of deception .
Sulivan	PERSON	's Island , as I had not boats for above 6 or 700 men I was reduced to one attack , without being able to favour that by any diversion on the other .
Hedrall	PERSON	's point 3 by landing within 3 miles of it , laccordingly made my request to the Commodore that some frigates might be directed to cooperate with me in that attempt to which he assented , but as my Movements depended in great measure upon those of the Fleet it was impossible to decide possitively upon any plan .
Sulivan	PERSON	's Island ; an attempt Contrary I must Confess to every Military principle , and Justifiable only in Cases of the success of the
Ihope	PERSON	they will arrive in good time to do that service which from a Variety of have the honour to difficulties they were prevented from rendering here .

John Bradford	PERSON	,
Robert Campbell	PERSON	, affords a remarkable instance , and is a slight specimen , of what every American might expect , if ever these Colonies should again fall under subjection to the tyrannical power of
Robert Campbell	PERSON	, of
Robert Campbell	PERSON	, Master of the
-LSB- Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	, who sent for and examined him , looked over his papers and returned them , saying he would put an officer on board to keep the sloop by him , as he was going to
Campbell	PERSON	, that if his vessel had no powder on board , she should not be condemned .
Campbell	PERSON	was returned to his sloop , the man of war 's boat came again , with a message from Captain Graves , demanding Capt.
Campbell	PERSON	's sword and pistols , which the officer having received , took of his own accord a small box containing six bottles of castor oil , and a small cup of jelly - meanwhile the men were not idle , but like their officer , took many little things that lay in theytheircould conveniently hide from their superior thief .
Graves	PERSON	, as he way , and broke open a cask of sugar , from which they stole as much as proceeded in villany , growing more callous , now demanded and took away Capt.
Campbell	PERSON	perceived that neither of Graves 's men understood working the vessel , nor taking an observation , and told them that as they proceeded , they would never reach
Campbell	PERSON	to vote for the nearest port , which being agreed to , they sailed for
Campbell	PERSON	's best assistance , they arrived in St.
John	PERSON	's harbour , the 21st day of December last .
Campbell	PERSON	then entered his protest against Graves and the customhouse , for all losses , & c. occasioned by the detention , seizure , & c .
Campbell	PERSON	perceiving his vessel detained , and no likelihood of any redress , applied for advice , to a Lawyer , one
Philip Hicks	PERSON	, who on his behalf drew up and presented a petition to the Hon.
Robert Christian	PERSON	, Esq ; Judge of the Court of Vice-Admiralty for the Island of
Graves	PERSON	was arrived , and pretended the sloop
Proctor	PERSON	, of which letter the following is the su -LSB- b -RSB- stance , viz. .
Thomas Warner	PERSON	, Esq ; What can or shall we do with the vessel we have taken , brought into port and seized ?
Campbell	PERSON	and put it out of his power to prosecute his suit , two of his sailors ,
Thomas Pacey	PERSON	and
John Lawrence	PERSON	were tampered with , treated and intoxicated , when they were subborned to swear , on the 23d January last , before the same most conscientious Attorney ,
Proctor	PERSON	,
Thomas Warner	PERSON	, Esq ; at least so he certifies , that Captain
Campbell	PERSON	had , to each of them acknowledged , that since the rebellion in
Thomas Warner	PERSON	, Esq ;-RRB- issued a warrant , to
John Jackson	PERSON	, Constable , requiring him , to take up and keep in safe cus tody , rects .
Campbell	PERSON	, he was not immethe said Capt.
Campbell	PERSON	, till he should be dealt with as the law ditenour of the warrant , but suffered to go at large for several days , no doubt to give him an opportunity to go off , if he chose to do so , because , in that case , by the new act , the vessel and cargo becomes forfeited .
Campbell	PERSON	, aware of the snare , made no effort to go off , but , on the contrary , urged on his suit .
Campbell	PERSON	never went near him .
George William Jackson	PERSON	Register in Admiralty -RRB- Mr.
Hicks	PERSON	, -LRB- before mentioned -RRB- Captain
Campbell	PERSON	's Attorney , acquainted him by note , that he , -LRB- Mr.
Hicks	PERSON	-RRB- was employed to prosecute the claim of Mrs.
Alletta Heyliger	PERSON	, for 28 hogsheads of sugar , her property , -LRB- part of the 65 -RRB- on board the
Campbell	PERSON	to put in his claim , and give security as the law directs .
Isaac Harvey	PERSON	, that he had provided security for the vessel , and Captain
Campbell	PERSON	was at liberty to take every advantage , on that account , that the law would afford him .
Heyleger	PERSON	, that it was allowed , and her property ordered to be restored ; but that no other claim being made , the Court , as their definitive sentence , declared , the sloop
Heyleger	PERSON	's 28 hogsheads of sugar -RRB- to be condemned as lawful prize , for the use of the Captors .
Hicks	PERSON	, the Lawyer , who appeared to be very intimate with Mr. Christian the judge , was a long time in close conversation with him .
Hicks	PERSON	told Captain
Campbell	PERSON	, that he had said , if a claim for the vessel and remainder of the cargo should be made by Captain
Campbell	PERSON	, it would have been allowed in Court , and the whole restored ; butif it should be done , preparations were made to exhibit another Libel immediately on the new act , which would certainly have produced a condemnation of the vessel and cargo , at fifty or 100 pounds more expence ; so that by Mr.
Hicks	PERSON	's advice , Captain
Campbell	PERSON	thought proper to wa -LSB- i -RSB- ve his claim , and acquiesce in the judgment .
Campbell	PERSON	, and therefore he could recover no damage on that account ; and of the Captain of the man of war none could be recovered , because by the act , no damage shall be recovered of any person seizing vessels , though it should appear on trial that the seizure had been illegally made , and the vessel should be cleared .
Capt Campbell	PERSON	cut off from any redress , and after suffering a long and cruel imprisonment , and innumerable insults was obliged to acquiesce in the loss of vessel and cargo , without the breach of any law , even those oppressive and tyrannical laws of our enemies themselves.The following accounts were for charges on the imprisonment of his person .

Hampton	PERSON	we learn , that advice was brought there from the Eastern ashore in a squall of wind , five or six days ago , with 18 pirates onof a tender , mounting two carriage and twelve swivel guns , beingboard , among them mr.
James Parker	PERSON	, late of
Dunmore	PERSON	's pestilential fleet was seen last Sunday morning at themouth of Potowmack.The following is a particular account of the attack and rout of lordDunmore , with his piratical crew , from
Gwyn	PERSON	's island.We got to the island on Monday the 8th , and next morning , at 8o ` clock , began a furious attack upon the enemy 's shipping , camp , and fortifications , from two batteries , one of five 6 and 9 pounders , the other mounting two 18 pounders .
Andrew Snape -RSB- Hammond	PERSON	, of the
Andrew -RSB- Lewis	PERSON	announced his orders foi : attacking the enemy by putting a match to the first gun , an 18 pounder , himself ; and the
Dunmore	PERSON	being then nearest to us , at the distance of only 4 or 500 yards , the shot passed through her hull , and did considerable damage .
Dunmore	PERSON	was obliged to cut her cables and haul off , after receiving ten shot , some of which raked her fore and aft .
Samuel -RSB- Denny	PERSON	, who commanded the other battery , soon silenced the enemy at the point , knocking down several tents , which put their camp into great confusion .
Charles -RSB- Harrison	PERSON	, who had the direction of those field-pieces , began playing upon the tenders , which he galled so much , that the schooner ran up .
Gregory -RSB- Smith	PERSON	, of the 7th regiment , with his company , to man the canoes and board her , which was done with alacrity .
Smith	PERSON	, very prudently passing the tender , pursued them so close , that , before they could reach the shore , he exchanged a few shot with them , and took part of them prisoners .
Lewis	PERSON	then ordered 200 men , under col. -LSB-
Alexander -RSB- M'Clanahan	PERSON	, to land in the island , which was performed as expeditiously as our small vessels would admit of .
Gwyn	PERSON	's island , near 500 souls .
Dunmore	PERSON	, Otter , and many others , to the amount , it is supposed , of 12 or 1500 L. On their leaving the island , they burnt some valuable vessels , which had got aground .
John Grymes	PERSON	's effects on the island have fallen into our hands , consisting of 35 negroes , horses , cattle , and furniture .
Byrd	PERSON	, on the approach of our canoes to the island , was huddled into a cart , in a very sick and low condition , it is said , and carried down to Cherry point , where he embarked .
Dunmore	PERSON	receivedcut her boatswain in two , and wounded two or three others ; and she had scarcely recovered from the shock when a nine-pounder from the lower battery entered her quarter and beat in a large timber , from the splinters of which lord
Dunmore	PERSON	got wounded in the legs , and had all his valuable

Captn Hamond	PERSON	-LRB- who does all in his power -RRB- without more assistance , to prevent them from running small Craft , and sometimes larger into the Numerous Ports of these two Colonies ; They are now become so formidable , even by Water in this Bay , that they have actually drove all our Tenders up to the Fleet , and
Captn Hamond	PERSON	does not think it safe to trust one of His Majesty ` sSloops alone in the
Miles of the Fleet	PERSON	, We were then just turning down the River from Watering , the Roebuck , and
Fowey	PERSON	, both gave them chase , but they were so far to Windward , that they could not come up with them .
Morrow	PERSON	will clear us of every thing but the Ships of War and Transports ; but where we are to go , or what we can do next to render Service to His Majesty I own I am puzzled to know , and as I find there is now not even a Chance of our receiving any assistance , I realy am at a loss what to determine on , for next Month it will become very unsafe for the Ships to keep the
Cannon Shott	PERSON	of either Shore , Guns are immediately brought to bear upon us , which it is not in the power of the Ships to dislodge , as the
Sholes	PERSON	will not permit them to get near enough .
