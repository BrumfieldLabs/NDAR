Duncan	PERSON	amounting to 8-15-6 , which I doubt not will be duely Honour 'd .

		I must confess the low price I have got for my Tobo .

		does not afford me great encouragement to try the Port of
Bristol	LOCATION	as a Market for that Commody .

		especially when I consider that part of the same crop , & what was deem 'd Rather inferior in Quality Netted me Seven Pounds twelve & Sixpence from
Liverpool	LOCATION	, my intention was to encrease my
Commission	ORGANIZATION	to Yr .

		You will therefore excuse my not complying with yr .

		request to assist Capt.
Aselby	PERSON	in his Loading .

		I shd .

		have vested the small Proceeds in Goods .

		But the present political disputes between these Colonies & the Mother Country which threaten us with a deprivation of our Liberties and every thing that is dear to us , forbids such a step and induces us to exert every nerve to immitate the spider and spin from our own Bowels , altho the Webb shd .

		This is the determined resolution of every American as far as I can hear from

		the Corrupt Aristocracy which at present rules the British Councils persevere in their arbitrary Measures with respect to
America	LOCATION	God only knows this Part of the Continent tho Ardently desirous of a constitutional reconciliation are to a man , determined that that day which deprives them of their liberties , shall also deprive them of their existence .

Newport Harbour	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	12th December 1774 Sir , Yesterday I arrived in this port , with His Majesty 's Ship under my Command , from
New London	LOCATION	, on a cruise , of which I had the honour to acquaint You , the 8th instant .

		Since my absence from this Place , I find the Inhabitants -LRB- they say here of
Providence	LOCATION	-RRB- have seized upon the King 's Cannon that was upon
Fort Island	LOCATION	, consisting of six twenty-four
Pounders	ORGANIZATION	, eighteen eighteen
Pounders	PERSON	, fourteen six
Pounders	PERSON	, and six four
Pounders	PERSON	-LRB- the latter they say , formerly belonged to a Province Sloop they had here -RRB- and conveyed them to
Providence	LOCATION	.

		A procedure so extraordinary , caused me to visit upon the Govenour , 2 to inquire of him , for your information , why such a step had been taken .

		He very frankly told me , they had done it to prevent their falling into the hands of the King , or any of his Servants ; and that they meant to make use of them , to defend themselves against any power that shall offer to molest them .

		I then mentioned , if , in the course of carrying on the King 's Service , I should ask assistance , whether I might expect any from him , or any others in the Government .

		He answered as to himself he had no Power , and in respect to any other part of the Government I should meet with nothing but opposition and difficulty .

		So much for Governor
Wanton	PERSON	.

		Then I endeavoured to get the best information of what they were at , from all Quarters , and enclosed I send it to you .

		3 Among some of their votes you will find they intend to procure Powder and Ball and Military stores of all kinds , wherever they can get them .

		Now , Sir , I submit to your Consideration , as there are three large and distant Chanels to
Providence	LOCATION	the Place the most probable they will attempt to land them whether the Assistance of some smaller Vessels would not be necessary in order to prevent them .

		What can be done by the Rose shall not be neglected .

JOHN LAURENS	PERSON	,
LONDON	LOCATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Charles Town So Carolina	LOCATION	12 Decemr 1774 .

		p Mr.
Pringle	PERSON	in Capt White .

		After I had embarked on board Le Despenser the 7th Ulto I wrote you as well as circumstances would permit a few Lines in answer to yours of the 3d which reached me on the point of departing from
Falmouth	LOCATION	, my Letter was sent on Shoar to be put into the
Post	ORGANIZATION	office by persons who were Strangers to me , the Consideration of which had led me to this particular retrospect .

		I had in the general an excellent passage from
Falmouth	LOCATION	to the
Coast of Carolina	ORGANIZATION	, fair wind & pleasant mild air we got into sounding 15 fathms the 32d day but happened to fall in
Soward	PERSON	of the Bar which converted the fair into an adverse Wind & gave us the trouble of two Days beating up ー In the Evening of the Second an unskilful young Man was put on board our Vessel in Character of a Pilot & he took upon himself the charge of conducting her the next day into this Harbour but an hour before Midnight I felt a violent Shock in Bed which awoke & started me up ー Gracious God Said I , surely the Vessel struck Ground this Instant or I dreamt So , the murmur was Scarcely expressed , when I heard the Captain 's Voice , Oh , I Shall loose my Ship , My Dear Mr
Laurens I Shall	PERSON	loose my Ship !

		ー Ah Sir Ah Captain I answered I am Sorry for your loss but compose your Self & be Steady recover your Spirits & let us think of means for Saving Lives ー then I hastned upon Deck where the Wind blew Strong , it was freezing piercing Cold & a rough Sea but less so than it would have been had not the Wind blown from the Land Side ー uncomfortable weather for Swimming or attempting the escape of twenty one persons in two Small inconvenient Boats , Breakers to be encountered , ten or twelve Miles from
Shoar & Seven	ORGANIZATION	long hours of Night before us , perceiving the Commander continued wailing & discomposed I addressed by old acquaintance the Master
Talbot	PERSON	& his Brother the Mate both active Seamen admonished them to be Steady not alarmed ー the pilot I comforted dont be frighted pilot by the accident ー recollect your Self , think where we are & for means of getting us off again if possible ー I ran below & brought up two
Lanthorns	LOCATION	with Lighted Candles & prevailed on the
Boatswain	PERSON	to hoist them on the Ensign Staff to Shew our distress to Vessels which were following us in order to claim their Aid as well as to caution one in particular which was very near & coming hastily into the Same danger , this Step had the good effect of turning that Vessel instantly back again , in the mean time Master
Talbot	PERSON	his Brother & the sober young fellows under them were acting their parts with judgement & boldness ー do this ー do that
Said Talbot	PERSON	& he was obeyed , the Ship Struck about eleven times , the Scene was awful , a high Wind , excessively Cold thumping admist Breakers on a
Bank	ORGANIZATION	in the open
Ocean	ORGANIZATION	in the forepart of a long Night , Boats not good ー I then thought of a phrase in one of your last Letters , `` Stageless Voyage '' So descriptive of Eternity .

		I considered or rather the thought was introduced in my mind that I was born to Die & I did not find my Self miserable in the seeming extremity , I was a helpless hand & could do nothing more than to repeat & press my advice to those who were Skilful & could work , to be steady & undaunted which I perceived had a good effect ; the people were animated active and Calm , every proper means was used & it was fortunately from a flowing Tide , the Ship was got off & into deep Water again ー we narrowly & amazingly escaped ー I felt a humble thankful heart & retired to my Bed again ... next Morning that is to Say yesterday we took in another Pilot who brought our Vessel to anchor about Noon not far from opposite to Mr
Rose	PERSON	's Wharf where I landed & preceeded immediately to this House ... I have only learned Since my arrival what I Suppose you have known for a Month past I mean of our American public affairs , that the Inhabitants of 12
United Links	ORGANIZATION	of this Chain of Colonies from
New Hampshire	LOCATION	to
South Carolina	LOCATION	have unanimously determined to make a firm & Steady opposition to the Measures adopted by Administration for enslaving us & our posterity ー there is a Spirit here which Surpasses all expectation its continuance will depend upon the Wisdom & policy of those Resolutions & associations by which we are at present bound ー these I have not yet Seen , no doubt you have as they are before this day made public in all parts of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, fathom them & give me your opinion ー dont take either Side & form a partial opinion ー but reflect well before you write , I write this hint because I know you are an American Zealot & may be in good time an Enthusiast ー I am both where I see the way clear before me .

		ー therefore I am so in the grandpoints of our controversy .

		ー I look forward now & perceive more fully those impending distresses which I have often pointed out to you , as the certain consequences of tenacity on both parts , but many people here I fear are not aware of them ー I am not afraid of encountering even poverty ー if we are all of the Same opinion we Shall in ー time Surmount every difficulty ー but where am I running to ー the Vessel is to Sail toMorrow Morning ー I must conclude .

		1774 1 May it please your Excellency : I received your Excellency 's favour of yesterday , and -LSB- d -RSB- in obedience thereto kept a strict watch all night , and added two men to my usual number , being all I could get .

		Nothing material occurred till this day one o'clock , when I was informed there was a number of people coming to take possession of the Fort , upon which , having only five effective men with me , I prepared to make the best defence I could , and pointed some Guns to those places where I expected they would enter .

		About three o'clock the
Fort	LOCATION	was beset on all sides by upwards of four hundred men .

		I told them , on their peril , not to enter ; They replied they would .

		I immediately ordered three four pounders to be fired on them , and then the small arms , and before we could be ready to fire again , we were stormed on all quarters , and they immediately secured both me and my men , and kept us prisoners about one hour and a half , during which time they broke open the
Powder House	ORGANIZATION	, and took all the powder away , except one barrel , and having put it into boats and sent it off , they released me from my confinement .

		To which can only add , that I did all in my power to defend the Fort , but all my efforts could not avail against so great a number .

		I am your Excellency 's & c. cfffs : 1 .

Portsmouth	LOCATION	New hampshire 14th .

		Decr .

		1774 Sir It is with the utmost Concern I find Myself called upon by my Duty to the King to communicate to You a most unhappy Affair perpetrated here this Day .

		Yesterday in the Afternoon One
Paul Rivere	PERSON	2 arrived in this
Town Express	ORGANIZATION	from a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	to another
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in this Town , and delivered his Dispatch to Mr.
Saml	PERSON	.

		Cutts a Merchant of this Town who immediately convened a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of which he is one , and as I learn laid it before them .

		This Day about Noon before any Suspicions could be had of their Intentions , about four hundred Men were collected together , who proceeded to his Majesty 's
Castle William	PERSON	and
Mary	PERSON	at the Entrance of this Harbour & forcibly took Possession thereof notwithstanding the best Defence that could be made by Capt. -LSB-
John -RSB- Cochran	PERSON	-LRB- whose Conduct has been extremly laudable as You will see by the Inclosed Copy of His Letter -RRB- and by Violence carried away upwards of one hundred barrells of Powder belonging to the King deposited in the Castle ー I am informed that Expresses have been circulated through the neighboring Towns to collect a number of People tomorrow or as soon as possible to carry away all the Cannon & Arms belonging to the Castle , which they will undoubtedly effect unless Assistance should arrive from
Boston	LOCATION	in time to prevent it .

		This Event too plainly proves the Imbecility 3 of this Government to carry into Execution his Majesty 's Order in Council for seizing & detaining Arms & Ammunition imported into this Province without some strong Ships of War in this Harbour .

		Neither is the Province or
Customhouse Treasury	ORGANIZATION	in any Degree safe , if it should come into the Mind of the popular Leaders to seize upon them .

		The principal Persons who took the Lead in this extraordinary Proceeding are well known .

		And upon the best Information I can obtain , the Mischief originates from publishing the Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	's Letter & the King 's Order in Council at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, 4 prohibiting the
Exportation of Military Stores	ORGANIZATION	from
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the Proceedings in that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	in Consequence of it which have been communicated and circulated here by means of Mr.
Rivere	PERSON	and the Dispatch he brought with him before which all was perfectly quiet & peaceable in the Place .

		ー What black ingratitude to the parent state , who has nourished , protected and supported them from their infancy .

		ー What can these things indicate but a civil war ?

		Horrid reflection !

		and such as freezes the blood of every humane heart .

		There has been a most extraordinary movement here a few days ago .

-LSB- George -RSB- Vandeput	PERSON	I received Duplicates of your letters in the
Scarborough	PERSON	and their Lordships Orders to take the
Asia	LOCATION	,
Boyne	LOCATION	,
Somerset	LOCATION	and
Scarborough	PERSON	under my Command , as they arrive , and employ them in such manner as I shall judge best for his
Majesty 's Service	ORGANIZATION	; To hire two
Marblehead Schooners	ORGANIZATION	; to hasten the Hind to the
Leeward Islands	LOCATION	without appointing a Captain to her ; and containing their Lordships Orders about the
Marines	ORGANIZATION	, borne as Supernumeraries in the different ships , in Case the Service should require their being landed ... I beg you will be pleased to assure their Lordships , that I shall attentively observe all their Orders to me , And in every Event according to the best of my Judgment endeavour to act for the good of his
Majestys Service	ORGANIZATION	entrusted to my Care ... Upon the Arrival of the considerable Reinforcements their Lordships have been pleased to send me , I have entirely altered the former Disposition of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	.

		The large Ships with a Sloop and a few Schooners will I think be sufficient for the Service of this Harbour until the Spring ; And in the mean time what Ships or Vessels can be spared will be doing considerable Service by being spread along the Coast to the Eastward , at places either notorious for smugling , or where Arms and Ammunition are most ligelyto be thrown in during the Winter .

		In this idea I have order the Gaspee Brig , lately returned from protecting the Fisheries in the
Bay of Chaleur	LOCATION	and
Gaspee	PERSON	, with the
Halifax Schooner	ORGANIZATION	to be stationed from
Cape Elizabeth	PERSON	on one side of
Casco Bay	LOCATION	to
Passamaquody	LOCATION	harbour , and have given their Commanders Directions to take every opportunity of Winds and Weather to move suddenly fro place to place , without their Intentions being previously made known to any person , by which means they will in the Course of this Season visit the greater part of the Harbours within the Limits of their Stations ; and although they may not be successful in seizures , yet I apprehend the Knowledge of their being on the Coast may prevent considerable Importations of smuggled Goods and Arms and Ammunition .

		I have also sent the Canceaux armed Ship to lie at
Piscataqua	LOCATION	, and the Lively shall sail the first opportunity to
Salem	LOCATION	, where on Account of the considerable Commerce of that port , the presence of a Kings Ship , particularly at this Juncture , is highly necessary .

		As the Tartar has been a long time off the Ground I have ventured on this occasion to spare her to go to
Halifax	LOCATION	, as well to guard the
Arsenal	ORGANIZATION	, and assist in case of Accidents from fire or otherwise , as also that she may be cleaned and fitted early in the Spring to be ready to act upon any Emergency .

		If there should be no pressing occasion for her Service this way , I intend to station her in the
Gulph	LOCATION	and
River St Laurence	LOCATION	; She sailed accordingly from
Boston	LOCATION	last Monday -LSB- December 12 -RSB- , and , as the Weather has been Moderate and the Wind fair , I expect she is arrived at
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		Since the Swan has been under Orders to repair to
Boston Captain	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
James -RSB- Ayscough	PERSON	has made several Seizures , which have detained him at
New York	LOCATION	'till this time , and he has just informed me that he is quite ready to depart and will sail for
Boston	LOCATION	with the first fair Wind .

		2 The Kingsfisher is arrived at
New York	LOCATION	.

		3 The Hope Schooner went Yesterday to her Anchors after being repaired and sheathed .

		The great difficulty is procuring sheathing Board from the
Sons of Liberty	ORGANIZATION	and the bad Weather have occasioned unavoidable delays in her repairing ; however as she is now fit for a little longer service , I shall not send her to
England	LOCATION	directly , but keep her with me at
Boston	LOCATION	ready to depart with Dispatches upon any sudden occasion , till when she will assist in guarding this Harbour ... As I do not consider the
Magdalen	LOCATION	of sufficient force to examine the great number of Vessels that Navigate in the
Delaware	LOCATION	, I intend to send the
Scarborough	PERSON	there , but she is come from
England	LOCATION	so badly manned and is in other respects so unfit to sail immediately , that it will be some days longer before I shall get her to sea .

		I have heard nothing of the
Somerset	LOCATION	or Hind .

		The
Boyne	LOCATION	parted with the former in a gale of Wind off the
Western Islands	LOCATION	.

		I transmit Copies of two Letters from
Captn	LOCATION	-LSB-
William -RSB- Maltby	PERSON	of his Majesty 's
Ship Glasgow	LOCATION	, who had the misfortune in returning from
Halifax	LOCATION	to run upon
Cohasset Rocks	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston Bay	LOCATION	last Friday Morning the 10th instant -LSB- sic !

		, Saturday morning -RSB- before Day light ; although it was generally imagined impossible to save the Ship , I have the pleasure to acquaint you that through the speedy and great assistance she received from the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, we last night got her up to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I am exceedingly concerned that this Accident has happened to a dean Ship , compleatly stored and victualled , on account of the great Loss to the Crown in Stores and the Expence of Repairs , and of our being deprived of the Service of a good Ship .

		I shall immediately cause her to be surveyed to know the damage sustained , and have her repaired and fitted again with all possible dispatch .

		`` A FULL VINDICATION OF THE MEASURES OF THE CONGRESS , ETC. '' BY
ALEXANDER HAMILTON	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- New-York -LSB- December 15 -RSB- 1774 The only distinction between freedom and slavery consists in tis : In the former state , a man is governed by the laws to which he has given his consent , either in person , or by his representative : In the latter , he is governed by the will of another .

		In the one case his life and property are his own , in the other , they depend upon the pleasure of a master .

		It is easy to discern which of these two states is preferable .

		No man in his senses can hesitate in choosing to be free , rather than a slave .

		That Americans are intitled to freedom , is incontestible upon every rational principle .

		... It is no easy matter to make any tolerably exact estimate of the advantages that acrue to
Great-Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	and the West-Indies from their commercial intercourse with the colonies , nor indeed is it necessary .

		Every man , the least acquainted with the state and extent of our trade , must be convinced , it is the source of immense revenues to the parent state , and gives employment and bread to a vast number of his Majesty 's subjects .

		It is impossible but that a suspension of it for any time , must introduce beggary and wretchedness in an eminent degree , both in
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	; and as to the
West-India	LOCATION	plantations , they could not possibly subsist without us .

		I am the more confident of this , because I have a pretty general acquaintance with their circumstances and dependencies 1 .

King	ORGANIZATION	's powder .

		Yesterday numbers more assembled , and last night brought off many cannon , & c , and about sixty muskets .

		This day the town is full of armed men , who refuse to disperse , but appear determined to complete the dismantling the fortress entirely .

		Hitherto the people abstained from private or personal injuries ; but how long they will be so prevailed on , it is impossible to say .

		I most sincerely lament the present distractions which seem to have burst forth by means of a letter from
William Cooper	PERSON	to
Samuel Cutts	PERSON	, delivered here on Tuesday last P.M. , by
Paul Revere	PERSON	.

		I have not time to add further on this melancholey subject .

		P.S. .

		The populace threaten to abuse Colonel
Fenton	PERSON	, because he has to them declared the folly of their conduct , and that he will do his duty as a justice in executing the laws .

		They will never prevail on him to retract , if all the men in the Province attack him .

		If I had had two hundred such men , the castle and all therein would yet have been safe .

		At this moment the heavy cannon are not carried off , but how soon they may be , I can not say .

		A LOVER OF ORDER '' TO THE PRINTER OF THE
NEW HAMPSHIRE GAZETTE	ORGANIZATION	1 Mr.
Printer	PERSON	,
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, December 23 -LSB- 1774 -RSB- As the Affair of Removing the POWDER and some GUNS from the FORT , hath been a Matter of some speculation , I was determined to enquire and judge for myself ; and find upon critical Examination , that the People of the Province of New-Hampshire are well known to have supported the Character of loyal Subjects of his MAJESTY , and have been distinguished for their Obedience to all Subordinate officers , without carefully attending to the present popular Patriotism of this Country .

		So far from pushing themselves into the Front in the present unhappy Disputes , they have been blamed for falling too far in the Rear .

		ー But what will not the great Law of Nature , that
Law	PERSON	of self preservation , the Love of Life , and it 's dear Connections , at length effect ?

		Alarmed with the Tendency of the Quebec Act , with Accounts that the Canadians and Indians -LRB- confirmed by some late Depredations committed by the latter upon the Frontiers of a neighbouring Government -RRB- were to be call 'd forth to enforce the late Acts of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, so disagreeable to all the Colonies , long inured to defend themselves in the wide extended Frontiers of this Province , by their own Valour , against the restless and cruel Savages of the Wilderness without any other Aid , and while destitute of Arms necessary for such defence , finding that his MAJESTY IN COUNCIL , not knowing their peculiar defenceless State , had been pleased to prohibit the Exportation of Powder , Arms and other warlike Stores to the Colonies without special Licence .

		ー Some of the good People of this Province , in the wonted honesty and Simplicity of their Hearts , imagined that nobody would have just Reason to complain of their too great Forwardness , if they seasonably removed some of the
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	from the Fort nearer to their Frontiers , when the Fears of the Inhabitants were most excited and where they had too great Reasons to think such
Stores	ORGANIZATION	would be soon wanted .

		Which they accordingly effected , without any great Tumult or Opposition ; as it was not suspected that they had any disloyal or bad intentions .

		I give this simple Narrative of this Transaction , to prevent any Colouring or Exaggerations therein that may be made by the Foes of
America	LOCATION	.

		GOVERNOR
JOHN WENTWORTH	PERSON	TO VICE ADMIRAL SAMUEL GRAVES 1 -LRB- Copy -RRB-
Portsmouth	LOCATION	30th Decr 1774 Sir , Since I had the honor to write you of the -LSB- 20th -RSB- instant , the weather has continued excessively severe , I have however conferred twice with Captain -LSB-
Andrew -RSB- Barkley	PERSON	and Lieutt -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Mowat	PERSON	of His Majesty 's Ships Scarborough & Canceaux upon the best means of securing the
King	ORGANIZATION	's service & Servants in this Town , from any sudden attack , which may be too reasonably apprehended from the present disposition of the many People in the Country , Who , having already broken into outrage , in the late assaults upon the Castle are under less restraint , & more implicitly devoted to the will and orders of the faction in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Reprisals having been recommended by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, 2 I am convinced a Plan has been concerted to that purpose , which rests only untill any movement on the part of Government is made in
Boston	LOCATION	, or any malignant view of opposition , shall spring their latent designs into action .

		In which case , I apprehend , the two Ships already here , would be insufficient for protection , from the extent and form of this River ; but that if one Sloop of War was added , with Fifty additional Marines , The whole Service would be exceedingly advanced , and with eminent usefulnes .

		Without which aid , or at least the Marines , it is almost positively certain , that only the
Fort Wm & Mary	ORGANIZATION	can be safely covered , and that all the Town will be exceedingly exposed .

		Those Ships may be so disposed in good Water , out of the Tide and Ice , and distant from Wharves , where they might come to sail with any Wind from N.West to S.West , and be at Sea in forty minutes , with a moderate breeze .

		I can not conclude without expressing my Sensibility of Captain
Barkley	PERSON	's and Mr
Mowat	PERSON	's constant alacrity & readiness in the most obliging manner to co-operate with me in the King 's service , which yields me the amplest assurance , that I shall receive
Evry	LOCATION	assistance practicable , from the Ships under their Command .

NEW YORK	LOCATION	JOURNAL , THURSDAY , JANUARY 5 , 1775
New York	LOCATION	, Jan. 5 Several letters by the last vessels from
Great Britain	LOCATION	and other parts of
Europe	LOCATION	, inform us , that immediately after the King 's proclamation issued , prohibiting the exportation of arms and ammunition from
Great-Britain	LOCATION	, two men of war were ordered to the
Texel	ORGANIZATION	in
Holland	LOCATION	, in order to prevent the transportation of those articles in English bottoms to
America	LOCATION	.

		RIVINGTON 'S
NEW YORK	LOCATION	GAZETTEER , THURSDAY , JANUARY 5 , 1775 New-York , January 5 .

		As we thought it would be agreeable to our readers to know the particulars of what has passed in this city , since the seizure of arms , & c. lately made at this port , for want of Cockets ; we have been at pains to collect the following facts which may be depended upon .

		As soon as the seizure was made , the ten cases and three boxes were carried to the Custom-House , 1 and the barrel of powder ordered to the powder-house on the way , some people appeared and carried it off from the Waiter , who had it in charge ; ー this being reported at the custom-house , the Collector immediately went to the Coffee-house , and informed the merchants present , of the rescue , which they highly disapproved of , ー proper steps were immediately taken , and in a few hours the powder was lodged in the powder-house : ー to prevent any such attempts in future that might disturb the city , the boxes and cases were sent on board the -LSB- Kingsfisher -RSB- man of war .

		Some days after this removal of the arms , & c. the Collector received from the post-office the following Letter .

		Mr.
Elliot New-York	PERSON	, December 27th , 1774 .

		SIR , A Number of fire-arms of British manufacture , legally imported , having been lately seized by yo -LCB- ir orders and conveyed on board the man of war , by which arbitrary step you have declared yourself an inveterate enemy to the liberties of
North-America	LOCATION	; in this light we view you , and from you we shall demand those arms whenever they are wanted , which is probable will be soon .

		You will therefore , if you have the least regard to the safety of yourself or your servants , who seized them , be careful to prevent their being sent away , as you may depend upon answering for a contrary conduct with a vengeance .

		ー We thought that your former genteel conduct in your department , intitled you to this notice , otherwise we should have been silent till a proper opportunity had offered , in which we might have done our country justice , by wreaking our resentment on you in a private manner : Do not slight this admonition or treat it as a vain menace , for we have most solemnly sworn to effect it sooner or later , and you know that our nation are implacable , we would not have you imagine that it is in the power of any set of men , either civil or military to protect or shield you from our just revenge , which will be soon done ; and in such manner as not to be known till it is fatally experienced by you .

		From the
Mohawks	ORGANIZATION	and River Indians .

		The above was immediately copied and sent to the Coffee-house , where it was pasted up together with the Collectors answer , viz. The original , of which the above is a copy , Mr.
-LSB- Andrew -RSB- Elliot	PERSON	this morning received from the Post-office ; he is obliged to answer it in this public manner , being entirely unacquainted with the author .

		Mr.
Elliot	PERSON	calls upon the person to appear , that can in any instance accuse him of having acted either arbitrarily or illegally in his office , that he may have an opportunity of answering him properly .

		If the letter is wrote with a view to deter an officer from his duty , Mr.
Elliot	PERSON	assures the writer , that as long as he has the honour to act as Collector , of the port of New-York , he will exert the same attention and firmness , that has for ten years past , enabled him to give satisfaction to his superiors in office ; and to live happily among the inhabitants of this city .


ANDREW ELLIOT	PERSON	At the Coffee-house the letter was by all disavowed , and greatly disapproved of : The Collectors manner of treating it , met with the highest approbation , notwithstanding which that very night the following printed hand-bill was secretly conveyed into almost every house in town .

		To the INHABITANTS of NEW-YORK .

		My Dear Friends and Fellow Citizens , At a time when slavery is clanking her infernal chains , and tyranny stands ready with goads and whips to enforce obedience to her despotic and cruel mandates ; when oppression , with gigantic strides is approaching your once happy retreats , and her tools and minions are eagerly grasping , to seize the cup from the lip of industry ; will you supinely fold your arms ; and calmly see your weapons of defence torn from you , by a band of ruffians ?

		You , whose glorious and renowned ancestors , freely lavished their blood and treasure , to secure to you the full enjoyment of liberty , that greatest of all temporal blessings ; forbid it , Heaven !

		forbid it gratitude and honour !

		ー How long will you patiently bear insult and wrong ?

		Are you so callous and dead to every sense of honour , as to disregard your reputation ; and the taunts and scoffs , of your fellow subjects in the neighbouring colonies ?

		What is become of your former magnanimity and spirit ; you who dared to degrade the Governor of the province , and exhibit his effigy , under the very muzzle of his cannon ?

		2 Are you dwindled to such dastards and poltroons , as to suffer yourselves to be insulted , and robbed of your arms , by a few petty Custom-house officers , with impunity ?

		Methinks I hear you say , it can not , it must not be : ー Rouze then , my friends and countrymen , rouze and play the men upon this occasion ; convince the world that you are still possessed of the same noble spirit , by which you were actuated in former times , and that whoever injures you , shall not fail to feel the weight of your resentment ; your country has been basely robbed -LRB- by the officers of the customs -RRB- of a considerable number of arms , which were legally exported from
Great-Britain	LOCATION	, and imported here , in the ship Lady
Gage	PERSON	, 3 and therefore not liable to a seizure , upon any pretence whatsoever , as they are actually the manufacture of
England	LOCATION	: ー Those arms -LRB- I am credibly informed -RRB- are now on board the man of war , and are in a few days to be sent to General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, and of consequence are to be used for your destruction : Can you bear such a thought ?

		especially when you have it in your power to prevent it ; does not the bare idea of it , harrow up your souls ?

		In the name of Heaven , throw off your supineness ; assemble together immediately , and go in a body to the Collector , insist upon the arms being relanded , and that he must see them forth-coming , or abide the consequences ; delays are dangerous ; there is no time to be lost : It is not a season to be mealymouthed , or to mince matters ; the times are precarious and perilous , and we do not know but the arms may be wanted tomorrow .

		PLAIN ENGLISH Some people may endeavour to persuade you , that it would be improper to call upon the Collector in such a way , on account of his former polite behaviour to the mercantile body , but this objection has not the least weight in it , as he has shewn himself inimical to the liberties of
America	LOCATION	, and has therefore cancelled every obligation .

		Early next morning a number of the principal merchants assembled , waited on the Collector the
Customs House	ORGANIZATION	, and assured him of their intentions to support him in the legal execution of his duty .

		They then accompanied him to the
Coffee House	ORGANIZATION	, where he was met by numbers of the inhabitants of all ranks -LRB- among whom was a number of Masters of ships , with their men -RRB- who appeared , with readiness to shew how much they esteemed the Collector as a just and good officer .

		Some gentlemen then called upon the authors of the letter or hand-bill to appear , or any other person , and accuse the Collector of having , in any instance acted either arbitrarily or illegally ; that the writing such letters , or disturbing officers in their duty , must be abhorred by all men that wish the support of civil government and good order ; that in the present case it appeared the Collector had done nothing but his duty , and that it was therefore incumbent on the inhabitants to support him .

		The justness of this proposal , and the inclination of the people present to adopt it , was instantly testified by three cheers .

		ー The Collector then stepped forward , politely thanked the audience for their kind attention on this occasion ; assuring them that nothing could be more pleasing to him than this public testimony of their approbation , both as a fellow-citizen , and as an officer of government ; at the same time declaring his intention of steadily adhering to his former conduct .

		In the

New York	LOCATION	the 29th December 1774 . ''

		After quoting in full the article from
Rivington	LOCATION	's
New York Gazatteer	LOCATION	he continued : `` The Arms mentioned together with some Gun Powder was Seized by the Collector , as they were coming from on Board one of the
London	LOCATION	Ships , to be
Shipped on Board	ORGANIZATION	a Vessel for
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, the Reason of Seizure was , no Cocket appearing for them amongst the Ships Papers ... The Arms & ca were immediately sent by the Collector on board either the
Asia	LOCATION	or Phoenix Man of War to prevent their being rescued , as a Seizure of some Goods made a little before this time had been at noon Day taken out of the Custom House Cellar by the Mob .

		ー The Collector understands that the Arms were afterwards put on board the King Fisher Man of War ,
Captn -LSB- James -RSB- Montague	PERSON	, who carried them to
Virginia	LOCATION	, where they were opened by Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	and distributed among the People under his Command . ''


Elliot	PERSON	's memory was at fault as to the immediate disposition of the arms .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	1 Sir
Preston Boston January	PERSON	8th 1775 In a Letter dated the 19th of December , and sent by the Sloop Phoenix from
Salem	LOCATION	, I acquainted you with the Arrival of his Majesty 's Ship Somerset on that day from
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	.

		This Ship with the
Boyne	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	are now moored before the Town of
Boston	LOCATION	, and I have the pleasure to say their Companies are in general very healthy ; The
Somerset	LOCATION	was so leaky at Sea that two Hand Pumps were continually at Work , and it is the constant Employment at present of one hand pump to Keep her free .

		In consequence of a Letter from Governor -LSB-
John -RSB- Wentworth	PERSON	of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, which I received by Express on Friday Evening the 16th December , a Copy of which -LRB- Marked A -RRB- is inclosed .

		I ordered the
Canceaux	LOCATION	and
Scarborough	PERSON	to sail immediately for
Piscataqua	LOCATION	, And as the Governor had represented the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	and Province Treasuries to be in Danger I put a Subaltern Officer and twenty Marines on board the Canceaux who sailed that Night , and the
Scarborough	PERSON	on Sunday Morning , though the Weather was very severe .

		I gave Captain -LSB-
Andrew -RSB- Barkley	PERSON	Orders to afford the Governor , upon his requisition , every aid and assistance in his power , and to do his utmost to protect the
Kings Servants and Stores	ORGANIZATION	with his Majesty 's Ships under his Command .

		On the 24th following I received Letters from the Governor , Captain
Barkley	PERSON	, and Lieut. -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Mowat	PERSON	, Copies of the two first -LRB- marked B and C -RRB- are inclosed .

		You will perceive by those Letters that the sudden and unexpected appearance of the King 's Ships in the River prevented a great Number of Cannon being carried off , and all further riotous proceedings at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	.

		I transmit a copy of a Letter from Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	-LRB- marked D -RRB- .

		2 I declined complying with his Excellency 's Request for the Sloop of War and the Marines therein mentioned , and acquainted him that having a great extent of Coast to guard I could not conveniently spare so large a part of his
Majesty 's Squadron	ORGANIZATION	to be at one place , more especially as I was of opinion the
Scarborough	PERSON	and
Canceaux	PERSON	were fully capable of protecting the Treasuries , and of affording Refuge to his Majesty 's Servants should they at any time consider themselves to be in Danger .

		On the 18th instant I received a Letter from Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	of his Majesty 's Ship Rose with a Copy of his Letter to Governor -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Wanton	PERSON	on the riotous behaviour of the Mob at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		Copies of both Letters -LRB- marked E. F. -RRB- are in closed 3 Though I was highly pleased with the Spirit Captain
Wallace	PERSON	shewed on that occasion , I could not avoid expressing to him my satisfaction that the Mob declined putting their tarring and feathering Scheme into execution being apprehensive his waiting so long for their Approach was not strictly justifiable , and may have been attended with fatal Consequences .

		General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	having requested that the Supernumerary Marines on board the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	might be landed at
Boston	LOCATION	to be disciplined this Winter in a manner to enable them to act on Shore with the rest of the Kings Troops , and it being our opinion that whilst they are on shore they should be on the same footing with the rest of the Soldiers in regard to their pay and provisions , as they are all employed on the same Service ; I have in Compliance with his requisition disembarked all the Supernumerary Marines and ordered them to be discharged from their respective Ships ; And by desire of Major -LSB-
John -RSB- Pitcairne	PERSON	have also lent them three subaltern Officers and three Serjeants , part of the Complement of the Ships lately arrived from
England	LOCATION	... On the 20th of December I received by express from Captain
Wallace	PERSON	an account that the
William	PERSON	and
Ann Ordnance Transport	ORGANIZATION	from
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	, laden with five hundred Barrels of Gunpowder , bound to
New York	LOCATION	, had put into
Rhode Island	LOCATION	the 19th in great Distress , her Rudder lost , and her Mainmast disabled ; as the powder is consigned to the Commanding Officer of Artillery in
America	LOCATION	for the use of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, the General and Colonel -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Cleaveland	PERSON	have given directions concerning it ; In the meantime the Transport is assisted and protected by the
Rose	PERSON	, who by being at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	has most certainly prevented that powder from being seized and carried to
Providence	LOCATION	.

		The
Halifax Schooner	ORGANIZATION	is so very leaky and out of Repair , and is in such continual want of patching to make her swim , that she is totally unfit for any Service but to be at Anchor , which I have directed her to do this Winter , and in the Spring intend to have her surveyed ; she is a very bad low Vessel , and so extremely wet and uncomfortable to the Sea men that no consideration will keep them belonging to her .

		The Hope is in very little better Condition , and must go to
England	LOCATION	when the Season will allow me to venture her , therefore as there is an absolute necessity for good armed Schooners capable of performing real Service to the Crown , and one is at this time particularly wanted to guard one of the Channels at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	to prevent the unlawful Importation of Gunpowder Arms and Ammunition & c which from very good Intelligence I am told will be attempted in large Quantities at that place I have taken upon me to purchase the
Diana Schooner	PERSON	of 120 Tons , about eight Months old , so exceedingly well built that she is allowed to be the best Vessel of the Kind that has been yet in the Kings Service , her first cost is # 750 Sterling and as I have thought it best for his
Majesty 's Service	ORGANIZATION	that she should be an established armed Schooner , I have directed the necessary alterations to be made in her
Hull	PERSON	, and for her to be fitted in all respects like other Vessels of her Class ; She will have the
St Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	's Guns .

		On this Occasion I have appointed Lieut.
Thomas Graves	PERSON	of his Majesty 's Ship Lively to command the
Diana Schooner	PERSON	, and Mr
William Lechmere of the Preston	PERSON	to be Lieutenant of the Lively .

		The
Diana	PERSON	will soon be ready for Sea , and I shall send her to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		As I am extreemly desirous of carrying on the King 's Service with all possible frugality , I shall defer taking up the two Schooners their Lordships have directed me to hire for guarding this Harbour until the Weather being less severe than at present will admit of Vessels navigating : The Schooners then will be of great use , but at present only an unnecessary Charge .

		In consequence of their Lordships permission Signified to me in your Letter of the 14th of October to purchase a small Sloop to supply the place of the late
Jupiter	LOCATION	employed on the Survey under the direction of Captain -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Holland	PERSON	, I caused the Sloop Spinckes -LSB- Sphynx -RSB- of 46 Tons Burthen to be purchased for two hundred and twenty pounds Sterling and delivered to Lieut.
Mowat	PERSON	of the Canceaux for the above Service .

		I am sorry I am obliged to add that after having fitted and stored her properly for the Service she was intended , in going round to
Piscataqua	LOCATION	after
Canceaux	PERSON	, she ran ashore about
Cape Anne	PERSON	; I have sent a Sloop with a Number of hands to endeavour to save the Vessel , if that shall be impossible , to bring away the Stores .

		I omitted in a former Letter to acquaint you that a Vessel being to depart from this Harbour in Ballast to
New York	LOCATION	, I procured her to go to
Piscatagua	LOCATION	and take in Captain
Holland	PERSON	, his Instruments Servants and Baggage , and carry them to
Perth Amboy	ORGANIZATION	, as he desired , for # 50 Sterling , instead of hiring a Ship on purpose , which must otherwise have been done at a much greater Expence .

		The Weather has been lately so severe that we have not been able to get the
Glasgow	LOCATION	cleared for the Carpenters , neither is it possible till that is done and she is hawl 'd ashore to ascertain the damage she has received ; In the mean time her Sails and Rigging and all her other Stores are put in some Store house on
Noddle	PERSON	's Island ; which I have caused to be hired at the rate of # 40 per Annum for that purpose , and which shall be discharged when ever the
Glasgow	LOCATION	can receive her Stores again .

		The Lively got round to
Salem	LOCATION	the 30th of December .

		The Swan arrived here from
New York	LOCATION	the 18th and sailed again for
Rhode Island	LOCATION	the 6th instant .

		The Hope Schooner sailed for the same place on Christmas Day .

		On the 24th of December I received your Letter of the 2d of November concerning the Sloop
John David Fenton Master	PERSON	, and in obedience to their Lordships Directions I have given strict Orders to endeavour to intercept the said Sloop which I find upon Inquiry is , as well as the Master well known .

		I have lately heard from the Captains of all his Majesty 's Ships to the
Southward of Boston	ORGANIZATION	, and think it proper to transmit a Copy of the Tamers Defects for their Lordships Information .

		I transmit also the State and
Condition and Disposition of his Majesty 's Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under my

		Captain
Barkley	PERSON	sent every assistance in his power from the

Lieutt Mowat	PERSON	acquaints me that the Ship makes little or no Water ; and that he believes the only damage she has sustained is losing a part of her false Keel , and the part below the Iron Work on her Rudder a little shattered ; therefore as no immediate inconvenience attends this accident , the Canceaux shall continue before the Town of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	untill the Spring affords a proper opportunity to examine and repair her Bottom .

		p L Despenser & 8th p Capt. Mattocs to which please to referー On the 11th all the deputies from the Several parishes & districts in this province except a very few who were unable to attend , met in General provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Pike	ORGANIZATION	's long Room where C -LSB- harles -RSB-
Pinckney	PERSON	was called to the Chair & Election adjusted ー thence we adjourned to the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	's Room in the
State House	ORGANIZATION	& there have we Sat every day , Sunday not excepted , from Morning to Night ; my Dining hour was from 6 to 9 o'Clock & once after Midnight , during Eight days we performed a multitude of Speechifying & Some business with all the Solemnity & formality of a Constitutional parliament ー As the Copy of our whole proceedings can not be procured in time for this conveyance I will recount as well as memory enables me the principal articlesー The Journal of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	being read as a Report from our
Carolina Delegates	ORGANIZATION	, the conclusion of the 4th Clause of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	which excepts Rice from the intended Non exportation after the 10th September was arrested , great offence was taken much altercation ensued ー My Neighbour it Seems had originally opposed that exemption in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	& his acquiescence gained by expostulation ー he finding the measure was disgustful & that hard constructions were passed , attempted to exonerate himself & made Such a defence of his own conduct as fell little Short of an impeachment of that of his Colleagues who are much displeased with him , he confessed that he had acted against his judgement & as there was but one other Side which he could take ー his Interest ー he made upon the whole but an uncouth figure .

		ー Evil Spirits had Stirred up the Jealousy of the Indigo Planter who compiained that partiality had been Shewn to the Rice Maker , the alarm Spread through the
Several Classes of Tobacco Planter	ORGANIZATION	, Lumber Cutter ,
Tar Maker ー	PERSON	in short every Planter & Herdsman considered his Constituent as injured in the Supposed indulgence to
Rice	PERSON	, a general Murmur ensued , the Rice Maker dreaded a disunion & however he was persuaded that an exportation of
Rice	PERSON	would be of public benefit , might aid & could not possibly injure other planters , yet many indeed most of them expressed a willingness to forego the Seeming advantage or to make Some compensation to their Brethren the Supposed Sufferers ー Mr -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Lynch	PERSON	honestly assumed the blame if any for the obnoxious Act , he was joined by the Rutledges -LRB- Mr -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Middleton	PERSON	was not present -RRB- ー these three desired the merits might be tried & refused the thanks of the people before their conduct should be fully canvassed ; they defended their cause with equal Skill & candour nor were they unassisted & after near three days contest the exemption was confirmed by a Vote of 87 to 75 ー 2 Mr -LSB-
Christopher	PERSON	-RSB-
Gadsden	LOCATION	was upon the question in opposition to his Colleagues , I humbly think he was wrong on both Sides & his behaviour underwent much censure ー it Seems to have confirmed a Serious Seperation between him & the two Brothers ー in the course of his debate he made & repeated certain declarations which whatever might have been his private Sentiments , discretion Should have locked up in his own breast ー in full
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the hearing of a Crowd of Spectators he insisted that from the beginning his opinion was to prohibit the Merchants from paying their debts to
Great Britain	LOCATION	by any Remittances in
Bills of Exchange	ORGANIZATION	,
Gold & Silver	ORGANIZATION	or other Merchandize ー & that if his advice had been followed General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	& his Soldiers would have been Sent back to
England	LOCATION	immediately upon their landing at
Boston	LOCATION	ー I heard the first Scheme with abhorrence & did not fail to declare my Sentiments accordingly & for the latter I know how easy it was for that Gentleman to March through the
Cherokee Mountains	LOCATION	kill every Indian & return unscalped to
Charles Town	LOCATION	without moving one Step from his Fire Side ー Shipping of a veteran British General & three Thousand regular Troops with less trouble than he could Ship a Cargo ー of
Rice	PERSON	was an interprizing Reverie fit only to be laughed at .

		After that great affair of the Rice was decided on or rather as a means to get well over it , a plan was proposed for making compensation to the
Indigo Planter &	ORGANIZATION	others who by the
Association	ORGANIZATION	ate to be restrained from exportation , calculated as it appeared to me merely to Sooth the Complanants , I was of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	who formed the Scheme & uniformly opposed it in
Commee & Congress	ORGANIZATION	ー called it a play thing , a Rattle , declared that it was neither Just nor Wise nor Adequate to the purpose intended ー but it passed ... 1 .

Jamaica	LOCATION	, that a Vessel might be sent , to inspect along the
Coast	ORGANIZATION	; I also wrote , to Governor
Chester	PERSON	at
Pensacola	LOCATION	to apply to the Commander of His Majestys ships there , that no illicit trade might be carried on by the Spaniards , on the
Western Coast	LOCATION	of this Province .

		This was done , in consequence of reports made to me , by our Settlers at the Musketers , that the Spaniards came on our coast and into the Rivers , to entice away their Slaves .

		I informed all the Settlers , the moment they sent me intelligence , of the arrival , of any Spaniards , I would without delay , dispatch the Government Vessel , with proper Officers on Board , to examine the Spaniards , and warn them away ; but , I have had no report of any Spaniards , although I have constantly on every occasion inquired into it : the answer I receive is , that the Spaniards have not appeared this Year .

		The complaint I am very apt to think , was intirely , without real foundation , and calculated to serve some private purposes , which may perhaps hereafter appear .

		I also inquired , if any Slaves , had ever been taken off by the Spaniards ?

		I do not find , my Lord , that any Slave ever was taken .

		I have the honour to be with the greatest respect & c.

Marshfield	LOCATION	, about 40 Miles from this Capital .

		We are at a loss for the Occasion of this extraordinary Manoeuvre , as all our Accounts from
Marshfield	LOCATION	agree , that the People in that Vicinity were peaceable and no Injury had been offered to any of the Tories .

		A few Persons there it is said , who had rendered themselves disagreeable and contemptible to their Neighbours , had taken it into their Heads to make Application to General
Gage	PERSON	, for Military Protection : In this , they engaged a Number of idle young Persons and some Negroes to join them .

		The Letters from thence agree that the Number and Quality of the Petitioners are despicable .

		Some Inhabitants not unfriendly to the Tory Cause , signified their disapprobation of this Measure ; it was then however encouraged it is said , by a Mandamus Counsellor , lately belonging to that Place , and some of his particular Connections .

Veracity	PERSON	, who resides in the Eastern part of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and who Although a firm Friend to Government has been persuaded and indeed obliged to act such part in Training a Number of Men in the Indian way , as to gain the Confidence of the Sons of Liberty .

		He tells me that a Plot is certainly formed for destroying his Majesty 's Ship of which You have the
Command	ORGANIZATION	; and that the Leaders of the Expedition are appointed , but he knows not who they are .

		The Method for executing it is to be this , the Passage Boats to
Providence	LOCATION	often come close to your Ship , it seems , as they pass the
Harbour	LOCATION	, A proper Opportunity is to be Watched , when 100 Men properly Armed are to be concealed in the Hold , the
Packett	LOCATION	is to come alongside the Man of War , and they are to rise at Once and take Possession of the Ship .

		How far this is practicable I am unable to judge , but of this I am persuaded , that no project is too hazardous or too wicked for some of the Rebellious Fanaticks of
New England	LOCATION	to attempt .

		You will be kind enough not to make use of my Name at present in this Affair , You are undoubtedly a Stranger to my Character But Although I am not personally acquainted in

FRANCIS WELSH	PERSON	TO THE
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICERS 1 Gentlemen :
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, February 8th , 1775 .

		According to your Orders , on Wednesday the 1st Instant , I proceeded down the River in the small Boat , with four Boat men , and one Tidesman ; coming up with
Gloucester Point	LOCATION	, I went on board the Schooner
Isabella	PERSON	, where I found one
John Ritchey	PERSON	, who called himself the Mate of the Vessel , with five more Persons .

		I desired to know where he came from .

		He told me he came from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	,
New England	LOCATION	, and that he had nothing in but Ballast .

		I desired that I might search his Vessel ; his Answer was I should not , as the Captain was not on board .

		I then ordered the People to open the Hatches and search the Vessel ; upon which he directly took out a Pistol and swore the first Man that offered to open the Hatches , he would blow him to Hell .

		About five o'clock the same day , one
Matthew Strong	PERSON	, whom I found was a Pilot , desired that I would let our boat put him on Shore .

		My answer was , that I should not let the boat go from alongside .

		They then hoisted out their own Boat , and put him on Shore , which was about three miles from
Town	LOCATION	.

		I then went down into the
Cabbin	LOCATION	with said
Richey	PERSON	.

		He told me that the Vessel and Cargo belonged to Captain
David Campbell	PERSON	; that he was sole Owner , and what was on board was all he was worth in the world .

		I then desired him to tell me where they were from .

		He told me from
Dunkirk	LOCATION	in
France	LOCATION	, and was loaded with dry Goods I then searched under the Cabbins , where I found a parcel of Keggs , which he told me was
Geneva	LOCATION	, which I found afterwards was true , and likewise about thirty Pounds of Tea , done up in Bundles .

		I then asked him if there was anything else in the cabbin ; he then shewed me one Trunk of Goods , that belonged to the Captain , and another that belonged to a Passenger .

		I then sent Mr.
Powell	PERSON	to you .

		About eight or nine o'Clock in the Evening , Captain
Campbell	PERSON	, with the Pilot and two Gentlemen from
Town	ORGANIZATION	, came on board , and ordered the Anchor up immediately , and said he was bound to
St. Eustatia	LOCATION	.

		Soon after the Gentlemen went away .

		About an hour after there came another Boat , with three more Gentlemen , unknown to me , desiring that I would not pursue the Vessel , for it would ruin the Captain .

		They then presented me 25 Guineas , and said they would give me more on Shore .

		I told them that I would not accept any Money , but that I would do my Duty as an Officer as long as it was in my power .

		They then went away , the Vessel being under Sail going down the River .

		About two o'clock in the Morning , on the second Instant , I seized the vessel in the King 's name .

		I then told the Pilot to take charge of her in the King 's Name , and if he carried her away he must stand by the Consequences , for she was the King 's Vessel .

		I then ordered one of our People to take the Helm , and demanded of the Pilot to take her up to
Town	LOCATION	.

		Upon that Captain
Campbell	PERSON	said the King never paid for her .

		He then put a Pistol to the Pilot 's head , and swore by the eternal God if he did not carry her down , and not run her ashore , he would put him to Death .

		The next tide of ebb , we got down to
Chester	PERSON	and came to Anchor .

		I then went ashore , and Captain .


Campbell	ORGANIZATION	with me , to get somthing to eat , for he had nothing on board but Bread .

		I then enquired if there was any Justice in that Place .

		I was informed there was .

		I waited on Messrs.
Francis Richardson	PERSON	and
Henry Graham	PERSON	, the only two in the Plate , and demanded their Assistance in behalf of the King .

		Mr.
Richardson	PERSON	was sick , and Mr.
Graham	PERSON	said he had no Business to go on Board any Vessel .

		I then waited on Mr.
Vernon	PERSON	, a Sheriff , who told me he would go and get more help , and assist me .

		He went away and I never saw him any more .

		I went on board again without any Assistance .

		They then weighed anchor , and went down 'till they came to New-Castle , and then came to anchor again , as the tide would not serve them any further , which was about seven o'clock in the Evening .

		I went on shore with two of my People , and left two on board , and waited on Mr.
Montgomery	PERSON	, the Collector , and Mr.
Maurice	PERSON	, Comptroller , and acquainted them that I was Tide Surveyor of the Port of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and that I had seized a Vessel from
France	LOCATION	, and they had taken her away from me , and was going to carry her off , and I desired them to give me some Assistance .

		They answered they could not , for the Commissioners would not allow them any Men .

		I told them I wanted only their presence , and I would save the Vessel .

		The Collector said he would go if the Comptroller would .

		The Comptroller asked whether I wanted him to go ?

		I told him I did .

		He then said he would not go .

		I then demanded of him in the King 's Name , and as an Officer of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	to assist me in holding this vessel .

		He went into his
House	ORGANIZATION	and left me .

		Mr.
Montgomery	PERSON	, the Collector , then said he could not go himself , but would get me a pair of Pistols , which he did .

		I went on board again .

		As soon as they found I could not get help , they said it was all their own .

		They then weighed Anchor , and carried us about five
Miles	PERSON	from the
Cape	LOCATION	, when Captain
Ritchey	PERSON	ordered us into the Boat , and that without Delay , or he would put us to Death ; so we were obliged to get into the Boat , and they cast off , which was about one or two o'clock in the Morning , although I begged them for God 's sake to let us stay 'till Daylight .

		After about three hours ' rowing we got on Shore , and was taken up the next Day , about three o'clock in the Afternoon , by Captain
Allen	PERSON	, and brought up to town .

		I am & c.

PITCAIRN	LOCATION	,
R.M.	PERSON	, TO LORD SANDWICH 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Boston	LOCATION	, 14th February 1775 .

		I think many of the people of this country begin to think they have gone too far .

		The behaviour of the
New York	LOCATION	people will have a very good effect : the General thinks he sees it already , and all the friends to Government are of opinion that vigorous measures at present would soon put an end to this rebellion .

		The deluded people are made believe that they are invincible .

		A very impudent publication , lately came out , asserts that they are an over-match for all
Europe	LOCATION	in their own country .

		When this army is ordered to act against them , they will soon be convinced that they are very insignificant when opposed to regular troops .

		I have sent your Lordship enclosed with this the newspaper with the late resolves of the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, impudent enough they are .

		Your Lordship will observe by the return I have sent to the Board that I have but a small battalion on shore : there are still fifty of the supernumeraries that were ordered out on board ship , this hurts the appearance of the battalion greatly , as they are the best of our men and ten of them belong to our light infrantry company .

		I have spoken often to the Admiral about this , but to no effect ; it was much against his inclinations that he landed any of us .

		This distresses me greatly , as I have a great desire to convince everybody of the utility of keeping a large body of marines , who are capable of acting either by sea or land as the public service may require .

		One observation I beg leave to make to your Lordship at this place , which is that I am a good deal hurt and mortified to find the marines so much shorter than the men are in the regiments ー the men of the
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	division extremely short indeed .

		I wish the standard was raised : no marine , in my humble opinion , ought to be taken who is under five foot six inches , and even not at that size if above twenty years of age .

		I often march out with our battalion six or seven miles into the country .

		The people swear at us sometimes , but that does us no harm .

		I often wish to have orders to march to
Cambridge	LOCATION	and seize those impudent rascals that have the assurance to make such resolves .

		They sometimes do not know what to think of us ; for we march into the town where they are all assembled , but we have no orders to do what I wish to do , and what I think may easily be done , I mean to seize them all and send them to
Eengland	LOCATION	.

		To the PRINTER .

		Mr.
-LSB- James -RSB- Rivington	PERSON	having in his last paper promised , that in a future one , would be published , a narrative of the conduct of Capt.
Watson	PERSON	, of the ship
James	PERSON	, lately from
Glasgow	LOCATION	; and as I conceive , from the general tenor of the publications in his paper , that if therein the narrative should appear , it will give very little satisfaction to any of the parties concerned , or to the public , Therefore I desire you will , in your next , insert the following full and authentic account of that whole affair , as related by those who knew the truth of every particular .

		A. B. On Thursday the 2d instant arrived here from
Glasgow	LOCATION	, the ship
James	PERSON	, Capt.
Watson	PERSON	, with a cargo of coal and dry goods , but as she did not arrive within the time prescribed by the 10th article of the association of the continental congress , a strict watch was constantly kept , by some of the sub committee , and a number of inhabitants , to prevent the landing of any goods , in a clandestine manner ; and the Captain was requested to procure such necessaries , as he might stand in need of , and immediately quit the port ; with this request he seemed rather unwilling to comply , and was encouraged to hope , that his cargo would be landed , from the assurances of a number of ministerial tools , who promised to support him ; for which purpose they employed a few vagrants , to go on board the ship -LRB- which then lay in the harbour -RRB- and bring the colours on shore , with a view of raising a posse , to assist in landing the goods ; but the banditti that were collected for this purpose , were soon suppressed by the inhabitants , who are for supporting the association , and who began to assemble in great numbers ; upon which the Captain conceiving the ship to be in danger , he sent the Mate on shore , requesting assistance , to get her under sail , as the seamen refused to do their duty ; this request being complied with , they immediately got her under way , and fell down about 4 miles below the city , where she remained -LRB- attended by a boat , with a member of the committee , and some of the townsmen on board -RRB- till last Thursday night -LSB- February 9 -RSB- , when she was brought into the harbour again , by an officer , and a number of men belonging to his Majesty 's ship King-Fisher ; which ship it is supposed , came down from
Turtle Bay	LOCATION	, expressly for the purpose of protecting her , and intiuiidating the inhabitants : As soon as it was known that the ship was coming up again , the people were greatly exasperated , began to assemble together in great numbers , and immediately went to the Captain 's lodgings , seized him , and after conducting him through many of the principal streets , attended by a prodigious concourse of people , he was without suffering the least hurt or in jury put on board a boat , with some hands to row him , and sent off : His ship then lying at anchor , two miles below the town , he went on board the man of war , which lay in the harbour , where his own ship did not arrive till the next morning , when she came to anchor under the cannon of the King-Fisher .

		In this situation matters remained , till Saturday morning -LSB- February 11 -RSB- , when they began to unmoor the ship , intending to get under sail , but was prevented by the Lieutenant of the man of war , who hailed the ship , and demanded if they had a clearance , and on being answered in the negative , he ordered them not to unmoor ; this obstruction greatly exasperated a number of people , that were collecting together to see her get under sail , who went immediately in quest of the Captain of the King fisher , 1 to know by what authority he detained the ship , but they could not meet with him ; he was however soon after waited upon , by one of the gentlemen to whom she was addressed ; and on being informed of the Lieutenant 's conduct , and asked his reasons for detaining her , he replied that he had nothing to do with her , and immediately gave orders to the Lieutenant to let her pass ; she accordingly got under sail the next morning about 10 o'clock , accompanied by a boat , with two of the committee , and a number of inhabitants on board ; which boat -LRB- after taking out the pilot -RRB- left her at 2 o'clock P.M. about a league to the southward of
Sandy Hook	PERSON	, with a fresh gale , and at half past 4 o'clock P.M. she was out of sight ー As every artifice has been used , and a variety of manoeuvers put in practice -LRB- by a set of ministerial hirlings -RRB- in order to get the cargo of the above mentioned ship landed , it must give real pleasure to every lover of his country , to observe , that the good people of this city , are determined to support the association of the
general congress	ORGANIZATION	, at all events .

		MASSACHUSETTS SPY , THURSDAY , FEBRUARY 16 , 1775
Boston	LOCATION	, February 16 .

		A correspondent has sent the following , viz. The Lively frigate of war , is lately stationed at
Marblehead	LOCATION	irt order to harrass and impress the seafaring inhabitants of that town .

		It is said to be by order of Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Greaves	PERSON	in consequence of the misconduct of his purser ,
John Williams	PERSON	, who had two boxes consigned him in the ship Champion , Capt. -LSB- Gustavus -RSB- Fellows , which arrived there from
Great-Britain	LOCATION	between the first of December last , and July -LSB- sic January -RSB- instant .

		These packages , agreeable to the continental association , ought to have been reshipped , or delivered to the committee of inspection for sale , or to be stored during the continuance of the association ; but instead thereof
Williams	PERSON	utterly refused to comply with the association , and with some other inferior officers of the navy demanded the boxes , alledging that they contained candles for Admiral
Greaves	PERSON	; the committee as well as the town , thought the doings of the Continent too important to be thus treated by a common purser , and the matter was so regulated that the candles were detained , until application was made to the committee in the name of the purser , for selling the same , and the association was fully complied with .

		for this instance of fidelity in the committee and town , is that community consisting of about seven thousand inhabitants , mostly dependent on trade and navigation , thus arbitrarily treated ; which must convince the American colonies , that had they not nobly resolved to maintain and defend their rights and liberties , the most insignificant officers of the crown would have been authorized and encouraged to insult them .

		The crew of the Lively are not suffered to land by the inhabitants of
Marblehead	LOCATION	, who seem determined to defend themselves against these unjustifiable proceedings .

		MINUTES OF THE

		The Governor acquainted the Board that -- Waterhouse , Inspector of his Majesty 's
Customs	ORGANIZATION	, had represented to him that one of the Magistrates and the Sheriff of the County of
Chester	LOCATION	, had refused their Aid and Assistance to the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	Officers of this Port , in preventing the rescue of a seizure lately made by them in the
River Delaware	LOCATION	, of the Schooner
Isabella	PERSON	,
John Ritchey	PERSON	, Master , with contraband Goods from
Dunkirk	LOCATION	, and had requested his Honour would call these civil Officers to an Account for neglect of Duty , and likewise issue a Proclamation on the occasion ; and as a foundation for such Complaint , Mr.
Waterhouse	PERSON	had put into his Honour 's Hands , the Copy of a Letter from
Francis Welch	PERSON	, a Tide Surveyor for this Port to the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	Officers , which was laid before the Board , and follows in these words , viz : -LSB- Here is inserted
Francis Welsh	PERSON	's letter of February 8 , 1775 -RSB- Copy of a Register `` Schooner

David Campbell	PERSON	sole owner , dated
London	LOCATION	, October 6 , 1774 . ''

		The Governor having thereupon desired the Opinion and advice of the Board , the Council , on due consideration of the Matter , gave it as their opinion that the
River Delaware	LOCATION	not being included within the body of any County of this Province , The Jurisdiction of the County of
Chester	LOCATION	does not extend into the
River Delaware	LOCATION	, and consequently that the Magistrates and Sheriff of that County could not legally afford them any such Assistance as was required of them , and that , therefore , it would be improper to call those Magistrates and Sheriff to Account for any Misbehaviour ; and further , that as the Vessel and her Crew were gone to Sea , the issuing of any Proclamation upon this Occasion would be useless and improper .

Marblehead	LOCATION	on account of the detention of some wax-candles imported for his own use , and which were seized bythe
Committee of Inspection	ORGANIZATION	.

		At first the people of
Marblehead	LOCATION	had determined on rescuing any pressed men ; accordingly , after Mr.
-LSB- William -RSB- Lechmere	PERSON	, Lieut. of the Lively , had pressed two hands from on board a vessel coming in , on his return he was surrounded by eight or ten whale-boats manned and armed ; he called to them at their peril to keep off , which they did at a distance of two boats lengths ; they then asked him if he had pressed any men out of the vessel he had boarded , which he answered in the affirmative ; they bid him deliver them up without making any resistance ; on his refusal , they pointed their pieces into his boat , and Mr. L -- ordered his men to do the same ; one of the impressed men took this opportunity and leaped overboard ; Mr.
Lechmere	PERSON	snapped his piece at the man , which missed fire , and he was taken up by the whale-boats ; the other man was immediately secured , and without further opposition carried on board the Lively .

		From this time they continued pressing without molestation , when the Select-men of
Marblehead	LOCATION	seeing their trade distressed , obliged the
Committee of Inspection	ORGANIZATION	to write to Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	, in the most penitential manner , for having disobliged him , and laid the blame entirely on their Chairman , which the Admiral took not the least notice of .

		The Select-men were obliged to wait on him , and promised to return the candles , and pay all costs and damages , and there should never be in future any cause of complaint .


Lo	PERSON	!

		their prayers were heard , and the press-warrants ordered to be withdrawn , as soon as they had satisfied the purser , whom one of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	waited upon , and paid him betwixt four and five pounds to defray the expence he had been at in going to demand them , and told him the candles were at Mr. -- house , and would be delivered on his sending for them ; this the purser refused , and insisted on their being laid within the threshhold of his door , which was punctually complied with .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	, SECRETARY OF THE BRITISH ADMIRALTY 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Preston Boston	PERSON	20th February 1775 Sir On the 25th of last December Lieut.
-LSB- George -RSB- Dawson Commander of the Hope Schooner	PERSON	sailed from hence with Orders to look into
Swansea	LOCATION	in this province , and upon not finding there any illicit Traders , or Vessels with Arms and Ammunition contrary to
Law	PERSON	, to proceed to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and put himself under the Command of Captain -LSB- Jams -RSB-
Wallace of the Rose	PERSON	, who had my directions to employ the Hope in guarding one of the passages to the Town of
Providence	LOCATION	.

		With the Hope sailed a small Schooner Tender -LRB- belonging to Lieut.
Dawson	PERSON	-RRB- who got safe to
Newport	LOCATION	.

		The Officer in her .

		Reports that he parted Company with the Hope among the Shoals in a very hard Snow Storm , which began the second day after they sailed from
Boston	LOCATION	; And that being thus separated he was obliged to run at all hazards in a very strong
Gale	PERSON	and thick Snow ; Fortunately the Tender drawing little Water got clear over , tho ' frequently in imminent Danger among the Breakers and in very shoal Water a considerable time .

		I have until now declined mentioning my apprehensions for the fate of Lieut.
Dawson	PERSON	, flattering myself the Hope might have providentially escaped ; but not hearing the least account of her since she parted from her Tender , I conclude she is irrecoverably lost .

		The hired Sloop that I sent to the assistance of the Canceaux 's Tender Spinckes -LSB- Sphynx -RSB- , driven on shore at
Cape Anne	LOCATION	as mentioned in my Letter of the 8th instant brought that Vessel round to
Boston	LOCATION	very much damaged in her Hull ; her Rudder , Cables , Anchors and some other Stores lost , two of her Sails blown to pieces , and her rigging greatly damaged .

		I have had her repaired and new fitted , and she is now again ready for service .

		The Northerly winds have blown lately at full and change and occasioned such low Spring Tides that we have not yet been able to get the
Glasgow	LOCATION	upon the Ways .

		In the mean time she is receiving such Repairs as in her present Condition can be given to her ; I inclose a Copy of the Damage she has sustained , so far as the Carpenters have been able to examine her .

		The Ships with me at
Boston	LOCATION	are beginning to be sickly , they have lately lost several men by deaths , and as desertions happen , nothwithstanding the utmost care is taken to prevent it , I have ordered the
Scarborough	PERSON	at
Piscataqua	LOCATION	, and the Lively at
Marblehead	LOCATION	, to raise men for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	; and have directed Captain -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Bishop	PERSON	of the Lively to press thirty Seamen , if that Number of Volunteers can not be procured .

		Necessity obliges me , contrary to my inclination , to use this method to man t_he Kings Ships , and as it shall be done with all possible moderation , though at a place extremely violent in supporting and carrying into execution the Resolutions and Directions of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	respecting the Non-importation Agreement , I trust their Lordships will not disapprove thereof .

		Upon application to the General and myself from the Inhabitants of the Town of
Marshfield	LOCATION	and its Neighbourhood in this province for Assistance and protection , apprehending themselves to be in danger from the violent threatenings of a considerable Body of People ill affected to his Majesty 's Government , the General sent them a Detachment from the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, part of which at his Excellencys request went in the
Diana Schooner	PERSON	, whom , after remaining eight days in
North River	LOCATION	, I have ordered to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	at the desire of the board of
Customs	ORGANIZATION	to bring from thence a considerable Sum of Money belonging to His Majesty 's Revenue .

		I transmit a Copy of a Letter and its inclosure received from Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	of his Majesty 's Ship Rose ; 2 the Scheme therein mentioned has not yet been attempted , probably they suspect that Captain
Wallace	PERSON	is apprized of their intentions ; but , let that be as it may , I have cautioned him to be upon his Guard against a set of
Fanaticks	PERSON	, who will without scruple basely destroy the Kings People or Property whenever it can be effected with impunity or little Risque to themselves .

		With regard to the disposition of his
Majesty 's Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under my Command it remains nearly the same as when I wrote my last Letter dated the 15th of January I am & c.

MURRAY	LOCATION	,
SANSOM	PERSON	& COMPANY AND
WILLIAM M. BUSSELL	PERSON	TO THE
NEW YORK	LOCATION	GENERAL COMMITTEE 1 Gentlemen We being the sole owners of the Ship Buelah from
London	LOCATION	do propose -LRB- with your approbation -RRB- that the Ship be regularly entered at the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	, In which case we pledge to you , our word and honour that no part of the Goods shall be Landed in this Province but the same shall be forthwith reshipped and sent off in some other Bottom .

		If it shall be thought more satisfac tory we consent that any Number of your Body be on Board the Ship while here to see that the above engagement is strictly observed This proposition we think must appear reasonable as being not inconsistent with the Resolution of the -LSB- Continental -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and therefore we are lead to hope it will meet not only with your approbation but that of the inhabitants of this City in general .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	having been silent as to what Bottom the Goods shall be returned in probably meant to expose the Owners of the Ship and Cargo to as little Inconvenience as possible by leaving that Matter to their Discretion which from the Terms in which their Resolve is Expressed seems evidently to be the Case their Words are ー -LSB- '' -RSB- If any Goods Wares or Merchandizes shall be Imported after the first Day of February the same ought forthwith to be sent back again without breaking ahy of the Packages thereof -LSB- '' -RSB- ー This we conceive manifestly declares that the Goods -LRB- which are the object of this Resolve -RRB- are to be Imported after the first Day of February but as there can not be a legal Importation without an Entry at the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	it follows that such Entry is presupposed and implied in their Resolutions and the more especially as they direct that the Packages shall be sent back unopened for as opening the Packages without an Entry would make the Ship Liable to a Seizure .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	could hardly have thought such rash conduct in the Owners to be probable and therefore from this prohibitory Clause they must have considered the Goods as in a Scituation in which the Packages might be Lawfully opened which plainly includes the Idea of a previous entry at the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	ー By permitting therefore such Entry under the Guards proposed We think that not only the Letter but the Spirit and Intention of the Resolutions of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will be fully compli 'd with .

		It has and probably may again be insisted on against this Construction of the Resolve that the first Article of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	prohibits the Importation of goods from
Great Britain	LOCATION	& c. after the first Day of December and therefore that it must be absurd to suppose that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	could intend an Importation after the first day of February in the sense we contend for as it would imply a Contradiction ー Whatever force there may appear to be in this Argument at first View it is entirely taken off by the Explanatory Clause in the Tenth Article which declares that in Case any Merchant Trader or other Persons shall Import Goods after the 1st Day of December and before the first Day of February the same ought forthwith at the Election of the Owners to be either Reshipped or delivered up to the
Committee of the County & c	ORGANIZATION	.

		That an Importation in the proper and Legal Sense of the Word is here meant can not admit of a Doubt since neither of the Alternatives imposed on the Owner of Reshipping or delivering the Goods to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	can possibly take place without an actual unloading of the Cargo for which purpose an Entry was absolutely necessary and therefore must have been intended by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	As to the objection that proper Evidences can not be given to the Neighbouring Colonies that the Goods are sent back unless they go in the same Bottom We think it must be effectually removed by having the matter Transacted under the Inspection of some of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in the way we propose .

		Besides we can not help observing that the Grand Object of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	seems to have been the sending the Goods back and as it must be immaterial in what Vessel they are carried this may well account for their Leaving that Circumstance to the Discretion of the owner ー And as we are disposed to comply not only with the Express Words of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	but likewise with the very Spirit thereof ー We shall therefore think ourselves ill used if we are obliged to carry the goods back in the same Bottom which will be laying a very heavy Burthen on that we and many more believe was not intended by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have no objection to your publishing this Letter as we are free the Public should have an opportunity of Judging thereof ー We may further inform you that the proprietors of the Goods are quite free that they be Reshipped in the manner here proposed .

New York	LOCATION	20th Febry 1775 Sir You will perceive from the Public Prints that the Assembly of this Province refuses to adopt the measures of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, & takes the lead towards a recon ciliation between
Great Britain	LOCATION	& her Colonies , Tho this be a true sense of a great Majority of the people , & of men of the best Fortunes , Yet we have among Us a set of violent Spirits of the lowest Rank , and desperate fortunes , countenanced by a few of superior condition , who lay hold of every occasion to rouse Mob & excite Sedition ; On the side of Government are the moderate men , who by all means avoid disorder & Confusion which gives an advantage to the hot heads on the other side .

		It seems reasonable that the friends of Government should be as much protected , as His Majts more urgent Service will permit ; Ever since the last War we have had a Regiment quartered in this place : We have now only 100 men .

		The Colonies to the Southward threaten this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, & declare they will join the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, Tho I can not believe that there is any other design than to bully .

		Yet as no man can tell which men in a Phrenzy may do -LRB- which seems to prevail over the Continent -RRB- it will be no excuse not to be prepared against every Event , especially after it is threatned ;
Hudsons River	LOCATION	must be passed before any body of men can join
Massachusetts	LOCATION	from the Southward of
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		For upwards of one hundred miles above this place there is not less than twenty four feet water in the Channel of that River , as I am informed by a Gentleman who carried a Mastship of Six hundred Tons up that distance last Summer .

		Now Sir I must leave to your Judgment whether it may be for His Majts Service to send a large Man of War ー to this port , which can on occasion put two or three hundred men on shore ; and to send small Vessels to obstruct the Passage of the River , if it afterwards should be thought expedient .

		On last Thursday night -LSB- February 16 -RSB- , the ship
Beulah	LOCATION	, Captain
William M Bussell	PERSON	, arrived at the Watering place , about three leagues from this city , in nine weeks from
London	LOCATION	ー The Pilots , we are informed , were ordered not to bring her up , lest her being in the harbour should give uneasiness to the city .

		The same night , a sloop with some members of the Sub-committee of Observation and other Citizens on board , went down and anchored near the said ship to observe her conduct , and they will continue there , till she departs ー The ship wants a new bowsprit , when she is furnished with this and other necessaries for her voyage , she will be dispatched without delay .

		ー She has neither entered nor broke bulk , and we are informed will be ready to sail about Sunday next .

		`` THE FARMER REFUTED , ETC. '' By
ALEXANDER HAMILTON	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- New-York -LSB- February 23 , -RSB- 1775 With respect to the justice of submitting to impositions , on our trade , for the purpose of raising a revenue , to support the -LSB- British -RSB-
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, by which it is protected , I answer , that the exclusive regulation of our commerce , for her own advantage , is a sufficient tribute to Great-Britain for protecting it .

		By this means , a vast accession of wealth is annually thrown into her coffers ... It will be impossible for the ships of
Britain	LOCATION	, to line the vast extended coast of this continent , in such a manner , as to preclude the admission of foreign aids and supplies .

		After every possible precaution against it , we shall still be able to get large quantities of goods from
France	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	... Great-Britain can never force us to submission , by blocking up our ports ; and that the consequences of such a procedure to herself ,
Ireland	LOCATION	and the
West Indies	LOCATION	, would be too fatal to admit of it ... A more desirable object , to
France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	, than the disunion of these colonies from
Great-Britain	LOCATION	, can not be imagined .

		Every dictate of policy and interest would prompt them to forward it , by every possible means ... With respect to
Holland	LOCATION	, notwithstanding express engagements to the contrary , her merchants , during the last war -LSB- Seven Years War -RSB- , were constantly supplying the French and Spaniards , with military stores , and other things , they had occasion for .

		The same , or perhaps , more powerful motives , would influence them to assist , us , in a like manner .

RICHARD HENRY LEE	PERSON	TO
ARTHUR LEE	PERSON	,
LONDON	LOCATION	1 D -LSB- ear -RSB- A -LSB-
Chantilly	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	-RSB- ,
Feby	PERSON	24th 1775
All America	ORGANIZATION	has received with astonishment and concern the speech to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		The wicked violence of Ministry is so clearly expressed , as to leave no doubt of their fatal determination to ruin both Countries , unless a powerful and timely check is interposed by the Body of the people .

		A very small corrupted Junto in
New York	LOCATION	excepted , all
No America	LOCATION	is now most firmly united and as firmly resolved to defend their liberties ad infinitum against every power on Earth that may attempt to take them away .

		The most effectual measures are every where taking to secure a sacred observance of the Association ー Manufactures go rapidly on , and the means of repelling force by force are universally adopting .

		The inclosed Address to the
Virginia	LOCATION	Delegates published a few days since in the Gazette will shew you the spirit of the Frontier Men ー This one
County	LOCATION	of
Fincastle	LOCATION	can furnish 1000 Rifle Men that for their number make the most formidable light Infantry in the world .

		The six frontier Counties can produce 6000 of these Men who from their amazing hardihood , their method of living so long in the woods without carrying provisions with them , the exceeding quickness with which they can march to distant parts , and above all the dexterity to which they have arrived in the use of the rifle Gun .

		Their is not one of these Men who with a distance less than 200 yards or a larger object than an
Orange Every	ORGANIZATION	shot is fatal .

		The
Virginia Colony Congress	ORGANIZATION	meets the 20th of next month for the appointment of Delegates to the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	in May next , and for other purposes of public security .

		The
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	who are both foolish and wicked , think by depriving us of Assemblies to take away the advantage that results from united and collected counsels .

		But they are grievously mistaken ー In despight of all their machinations , public Councils will be held and public measures adopted for general security .

		Still we hope that the proceedings of the last
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	when communicated to the people of
England	LOCATION	will rouse a spirit that proving fatal to an abandoned Ministry may save the whole Empire from the impending destruction .

		The honorable
Colo Lee	PERSON	of
Stratford	LOCATION	was buried this day , he died the 21st Ultimo after a months painful illness .

		He is a public loss , and if the Ministry go on filling up these vacancies in the
Council	ORGANIZATION	with raw boys and hotheaded senseless people , the affairs of
Virginia	LOCATION	must be in perpetual confusion , altho the present dispute should be accomodated It is absolutely necessary that some grave sensible Men should now be placed there in ordei : to temper the present body .

		The pamphlet entitled an Appeal & c is , I think , the best I have read on the subject amidst such a variety of finely reasoned ones Farewell P.S. By authentic accounts just come to hand all the Ministerial efforts with
New York	LOCATION	and the Jersey Governments have failed , both Assemblies have highly approved the proceedings of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, thanked their Delegates and appointed them to represent their respective Colonies in the next May
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		From
N. York	PERSON	they have lately sent back a Ship from
Glasgow	LOCATION	with goods that arrived after 1st of Feby scarcely allowing the Vessel time to get fresh provisions .

		2 It is now therefore certain that without a redress of Grievances ,
G. Britain	LOCATION	must prepare to do entirely without the N. American trade , nor will the
British Isles	LOCATION	in the
W. Indies	LOCATION	get their usual necessary supplies from the Continent .


Georgia	LOCATION	has acceeded to the
Continental Association	ORGANIZATION	and we understand
Canada	LOCATION	will have Delegates in the next
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		You will oblige me greatly by giving my boys advice and pressing to diligent application as often as you have leisure to do so .

		3 You never say whether or when you take the Gown and where you propose to practice .

		4 Farewell 1 .

		NARRATIVE FOUND IN THE FAMILY PAPERS OF MAJOR
JOHN PEDRICK	PERSON	1 On the 26th February , 1775 , General -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	received information that cannon and military stores were to be deposited at
Salem	LOCATION	and he sent Lieut. Col.
-LSB- Alexander -RSB- Leslie	PERSON	with one hundred and forty soldiers in a transport to seize them ; fortunately , they were discovered in the act of landing at
Marblehead Neck	LOCATION	; a man went around to the church doors with a drum beating `` To arms !

		to Arms ! ''

		It was during service .

		Major -LSB-
John -RSB- Pedrick	PERSON	hastened out and was told that the British had landed on the Neck ; at once he understood their object , hastened to his residence , had his parade horse saddled , rode away with the utmost speed , and met a person who said the troops had formed their ranks on
Bubier	PERSON	's Plain and were marching on towards
Salem	LOCATION	.

		He quickly followed , heard the drum and fife playing
Yankee Doodle	ORGANIZATION	; when he had so gained upon them he leaped his horse over a wall which brought him to a steep hill leading to
Gardner	PERSON	's Mills , which was so steep in descent it was looked upon as a breakneck place and really safest to go down at a gallop .

		At the bottom of the hill he came upon Col.
Leslie	PERSON	, with whom he was well acquainted and who at that moment was in the rear of his troops .

		They exchanged a military salute and
Leslie	PERSON	ordered his men `` to file to the right and left and give Major
Pedrick	PERSON	the pass . ''

		This pass was a narrow wooden bridge over a river which emptied into the sea and near which was a great -LSB- grist ? -RSB-

		; leaving the bridge , the river wound around a sharp point of land , so that after a few yards were passed he was concealed from the observation of any one upon the bridge .

		Major
Pedrick	PERSON	thanked Col.
Leslie	PERSON	for his courtesy , passed between the files of soldiers , and while in view of them rode slowly ; but , once around the point of land , put spurs to his horse , went to
Salem	LOCATION	with all speed , stopped at the door of the
North Church	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- it was during the time of service , being Sunday -RRB- explained Col.
Leslie	PERSON	's object , then dashed down to
Spike	PERSON	bridge to have the draw raised so as to prevent the passage of the `` Regulars . ''

		Rev. Mr.
-LSB- Thomas -RSB- Barnard	PERSON	and others followed as quickly as possible and it was arranged that Mr.
Barnard	PERSON	was to remain in charge of it .

		Major
Pedrick	PERSON	said to Mr.
Barnard	PERSON	that Col.
Leslie	PERSON	would order the draw to be lowered in the `` King 's name ; '' that he could reply it was not the `` King 's '' highway , but a private road , and requested him to parley with him and resort to all expedients to delay him until a message should come from Major
Pedrick	PERSON	to say that the cannon were safe .

		Col.
Leslie	PERSON	threatened that they would cross the river in boats and was told they would be sunk if it were attempted : as it was , they did destroy a few .

		The militia assembled and the Regulars were so exasperated that it was with difficulty the gentlemen present prevented bloodshed .

		On his return to the bridge , Major
Pedrick	PERSON	heard Col.
Leslie	PERSON	say that his orders were `` to cross the bridge , '' and he would do it at all hazards .

		Major
Pedrick	PERSON	then requested Mr.
Barnard	PERSON	who was on the same side of the bridge with Col.
Leslie	PERSON	to say to him that if it were a `` point of honor '' with him to do it , that the draw should be lowered for him and his men , to cross over and to march so many paces beyond ; provided that being accomplished they would return to their place of embarkation .

		After some consultation with his officers this was agreed to by Col.
Leslie	PERSON	, and being done the troops wheeled round and the music played by the band was `` The world turned upside down . ''

		Immediately upon Col.
Leslie	PERSON	's accepting the terms , Major
Pedrick	PERSON	rode a short distance away , as he felt it would be uncourteous to remain and witness his annoyance ; as in yielding the pass to him he had missed the opportunity of carrying the object for which he had been sent .

		I am however of opinion that he will do what you wish him , to do , if I can form any Judgement from Conversations I have had with him of the Propriety of the Measure .

		The Conduct of your Assembly gives fresh spirits to the Royalists in this Province , who wait with the greatest Impatience to hear the Fate of the Buelah .

		If she lands her Cargo it will be the means of inducing other Ports in every Province to do the like .

		We have yet had no Tryal of the kind in this Province , but I think if any ship arrives with a resolute Master that he will carry his Point , particularly at
Marblehead	LOCATION	; where they have appeared the stoutest and most insolent if you judge of them by their Resolves .

		But the
Committee of Inspection	ORGANIZATION	there has been roughly handled lately on account of a seizure , and have acted with more meekness than was expected from them by the
Rebel Party	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Admiral has threatened the Town and pressed some of their People , and I have declared I would apprehend them if they presumed to touch any man 's Property .

		I sincerely pray that
New York	LOCATION	may continue to pursue the

MARSHFIELD	LOCATION	.

		Gentlemen , The warmth with which you declare your principles of loyalty to your Sovereign and his constitutional government , can not fail of being grateful to the mind of every lover of his country : And it is much to be wished , that the uniform propriety of your conduct will extend its influence , to the removal of those groundless jealousies , which have unhappily warped the affections of too many of your countrymen from the parent state , and which are now tending to raise violent commotions , and involve in ruin and destruction this unfortunate province .

		The approbation you are pleased to express of his Majesty 's appointment , at this critical juncture , to the command of his
American Fleet	ORGANIZATION	, is flattering ; and you may be assured that my countenance and support shall never be wanting to protect the friends of the British Government , and reduce to order and submission those who would endeavour to destroy that peace and harmony which it is the end of good legislation to produce .

Boston Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	, February 27 , 1775 .


ESSEX GAZETTE	ORGANIZATION	, TUESDAY , FEBRUARY 21 TO 28 , 1775
Salem	LOCATION	, February 28 .

		Last Sabbath -LSB- February 26 -RSB- the Peace of the Town was disturbed by the coming of a Regiment of the King 's Troops , the Particulars relative to which are as follows .

		ー A Transport arrived at
Marblehead	LOCATION	, apparently manned as usual .

		Between two and three o'Clock -LRB- as soon as the People had gone to Meeting -RRB- the Decks were covered with Soldiers , who having loaded and fixed their Bayonets , landed with great Dispatch ; and instantly marched off .

		Some of the Inhabitants suspecting they were bound to
Salem	LOCATION	, to seize some Materials there preparing for an Artillery , dispatched several Messengers to inform us of it .

		These Materials were on the North Side of the
North River	LOCATION	, and to come at them it was necessary to cross a Bridge , one Part of which was made to draw up , for the Convenience of letting Vessels pass through .

		The Inhabitants kept a Look-out for the Appearance of the Troops .

		The Van Guard arrived , and took their Rout down in Town as far as the
Long-Wharf	LOCATION	; perhaps to decoy the Inhabitants thither , away from the Place to which the main Body were destined .

		The main Body arrived soon after and halted a few Minutes by the Town-House .

		It is said Inquiry was immediately made by some of the Officers for a Half-Brother of Col.
-LSB- William -RSB- Browne	PERSON	, the Mandamus Counsellor .

		1 Be this as it may , he was very soon whispering in the Colonel 's Ear , 2 in the Front of the Regiment ; and when he parted from the Colonel , the Regiment marched off with a quick Pace , in a direct Course for the
North Bridge	LOCATION	; just before their Entrance upon which , the Draw-Bridge was pulled up .

		The Regiment however pushed forward till they came to the Draw-Bridge , not observing -LRB- as it seemed -RRB- that it was drawn up .

		The Colonel who led them expressed some
Surprize	LOCATION	; and then turning about , ordered an Officer to face his Company to a Body of Men standing on a Wharf on the other Side the Draw-Bridge , and fire .

		One of our Townsmen 3 -LRB- who had kept along Side the Colonel from the Time he marched from the Town-House -RRB- instantly told him he had better not fire , that he had no Right to fire without further Orders , `` and if you do fire -LRB- said he -RRB- you will be all dead Men . ''

		The company neither fired nor faced .

		The Colonel then retired to the Center of his Regiment , assembled his Officers , and held a Consultation : Which being ended , the Colonel advanced a little , and declared he would maintain his Ground , and go over the Bridge before he returned , if it was a Month first .

		The same Townsman replied , he might stay there as long as he pleased , no Body cared for that .

		That HalfBrother before mentioned -LRB- it is said -RRB- made towards the Bridge , but seeing the Draw-Bridge up , says , `` It is all over with us . ''

		He has since disappeared .

		Mean while two large Gondolas that lay aground -LRB- for it was low-water -RRB- were scuttled , lest they should cross the Channel in them .

		But whilst one Gentleman with his Assistants was scuttling his own Gondola , a Party of about twenty Soldiers jumped into it , and with their Bayonets charged against our unarmed Townsmen -LRB- some of whom they pricked -RRB- compelled them to quit it ; but before this a sufficient Hole had been made in the Bottom .

		This Attack of the Soldiers , and some other Occurrences , occasioned a little Bickering , but by the Interposition of some of the Inhabitants the Disputes subsided .

		At length some Gentlemen asked the Colonel what was his Design in making this Movement , and why he would cross the Bridge ?

		He said he had Orders to cross it , and he would cross it if he lost his Life with the Lives of all his Men .

		And now -LRB- or before -RRB- asked why the King 's Highway was obstructed ?

		He was told it was not the King 's Road , but the Property of the Inhabitants , who had a Right to do what they pleased with it .

		Finally the Colonel said he must go over ; and if the Draw-Bridge were let down so that he might pass , he pledged his Honour he would march not above thirty Rods beyond it , and then immediately return .

		The Regiment had now been on the Bridge about an Hour and an Half ; and every Thing being secured , the Inhabitants directed the Draw-Bridge to be let down .

		The Regiment immediately passed over , marched a few Rods , returned , and with great Expedition went back again to
Marblehead	LOCATION	, where they embarked on board the Transport without Delay .

		The Regiment brought with them Lanthorns , Hatchets , Pick-Axes ,
Spades	LOCATION	, Hand-Spikes and several Coils of Rope .

		When all the Circumstances are considered , there can remain no Doubt that the sole Purpose of this Manoeuvre was to steal away the Artillery Materials before mentioned .

		In the first Place the Regiment was taken from the Castle , so that the Inhabitants of
Boston	LOCATION	might be prevented giving us any Intelligence :
The Transport	ORGANIZATION	arrived at
Marblehead	LOCATION	a considerable
Time	ORGANIZATION	before the Regiment was landed , but the Men were kept snug under the Hatches : As soon as the Inhabitants of
Marblehead	LOCATION	had got to Meeting , the Troops landed , and pushed on their March to
Salem	LOCATION	, and proceeded to the very Spot where the Materials for the Artillery were lodged .

		But meeting with this sad Rebuff , and finding their Plot was discovered , they then made a Retreat .

		ー 'T is regretted that an Officer of Colonel
Leslie	PERSON	's acknowledged Worth , should be obliged , in Obedience to his Orders , to come upon so pitiful an Errand .

		Various Reports were spread abroad respecting the Troops , ー the Country was alarmed ; and one Company arrived in Arms from
Danvers	LOCATION	just as the Troops left the Town .

		We immediately dispatched Messengers to the neighbouring Towns to save them the Trouble of coming in ; but the Alarm flew like Lightening -LRB- and Fame doubtless magnified the first simple Reports -RRB- so that great Numbers were in Arms , and some on the March , before our Messengers arrived .

Boston	LOCATION	March 1st 1775 Sir The 15th .

		February at three O'Clock in the Morning I sailed from
Cranberry Harbour	PERSON	, with His Majesty 's Schooner the
Halifax	LOCATION	, intending to put into
Machias	LOCATION	to take a Pilot for Passamiquody , the Pilot we then had Onboard not being acquainted with the Coast further than
Machias	LOCATION	; At half past twelve the Pilot being deceived in the Land , run the Schooner upon a Ridge of Rocks off
Sheep Island	LOCATION	, three Leagues from
Bucks Harbour	LOCATION	near
Machias	LOCATION	, the Vessel going at that time seven knots and a half with a fresh
Gale	PERSON	at W.S.W. ー the Rudder was immediately knocked off on the Vessel striking ー I then ordered the Mainsail to be lowered down , hoping to force her off with the Head Sails ; upon Sounding we found she had sued three feet forward and surrounded with Rocks , that had three feet less Water on them than She drew ー I then ordered the Sails to be furled and the Boats hoisted out , to save what Provisions and Necessaries we could for our Subsistance ー At six found the Tide had left the Vessel dry upon the Rocks , with her Starboard Side bulged , seeing it was impossible to save her , we with much difficulty got ashore upon
Sheep Island	LOCATION	where we encamped , at seven came on a very hard Gale of Wind with Frost and Snow ; ー At 8 .

		the Sea broke over the Mast Heads and overset the Vessel .

		We saw no more of her till day break , when we found she was beat to pieces , nothing but the Masts appearing upon the Water , we at the same time saw the Yawl was stove to pieces on the Rocks ; ー At 8 in the Morning it was more moderate , and finding we were upon an uninhabited Island , I thought it necessary to embrace the first Opportunity of sending the Boats to the Main to endeavour to find some Vessel or Boat , to carry us off the
Island	LOCATION	, having but one Boat , the loss of which must have cut Us off from any resource , and the Master being an entire Stranger on the Coast , did not think it prudent to risque the Boat without the Pilot , who I ordered to go , cautioning the Master at the same -LSB- time -RSB- to prevent his escape from him ー At nine the next Morning the Master returned with A Small Schooner from
Buck 's Harbour	LOCATION	, where he informed me the Pilot made his escape from him , at half past ten embarked for
Bucks Harbour	LOCATION	.

		As a Detail of what occurred afterwards would be too tedious to insert at present , I must beg leave to refer to the enclosed Journal of our Proceedings from the time we left
Cranberry Harbour	LOCATION	, to our arrival in this Port .

DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
New York	LOCATION	1st Mar 1775 Two vessels have arrived here since the first of February one of them from
Glasgow	LOCATION	has been obliged to depart with her Cargoe to
Jamaica	LOCATION	.

		2 Neither the Master of the Ship nor the merchant to whom the Cargoe was consigned , would demand any assistance , or shewed any inclination to have the goods landed .

		It was not therefore possible for Government to interfere with any propriety .

		The second ship is from
London	LOCATION	; she still lies a few miles below the
Harbour	LOCATION	, and it is said is to carry her Cargo to
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		Neither the master nor owners of this shipor Cargoe , have made any application to Government .

		The success , my Lord , which the violent
Party	ORGANIZATION	have had in preventing there vessels from Landing their Cargoes here , has given them great spirits , and it a strong counterpoise to the conduct of the Assembly ー Your Ldp .

		will beleive it has chagrined me a good deal ... We have had , my Lord , only one hundred men of the Royal Irish Regiment in this City for several months past , and the
Kings Fisher Sloop of War	ORGANIZATION	in the harbour .

		The moderate Inhabitants have constantly expressed a wish that we had a more formidable Power in the Place to awe the licentious & encourage the freinds of Government .

		convinced that it would be for His
Matys Service	ORGANIZATION	, I wrote to Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	on the 20th Ulto and suggested to him the utility of sending one of the large Ships from
Boston	LOCATION	to this Place .

		I mentioned of what consequence it would be to keep the command of
Hudsons River	LOCATION	which must be passed by the Southern People before they can join the Eastern .

		The Idea of their really fighting the
Kings Troops	ORGANIZATION	, is so full of
Madess	LOCATION	and folly , that one can hardly think seriously of it ー yet my Lord a neglect of proper precautions may encourage wild enthusiasts to attempt what they would not otherwise venture upon .

		Except the measures that are pursued in support of the non importation association , the people of this Province are in other respects very quiet and shew no inclination to copy the extravagant Plans of their neighbours 1 .

		His Excellency General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, having information that some brass cannon were deposited in or near

Marblehead	LOCATION	last Sunday -LSB- February 26 -RSB- at 4 o'clock in the afternoon , and marched immediately to
Salem	LOCATION	; where they were informed by the officer sent forward , that he had been in the place where the cannon were supposed to have been concealed ; but found none : But the commanding officer having received intelligence that some trucks were seen going out of
Salem	LOCATION	that morning , he continued his march the road they were said to have taken ; but coming to a draw-bridge over an arm of the sea , he found the people on the opposite side had taken it up to prevent his passage : He desired it might be immediately let down ; but they refused ; saying it was a private road , and that he had no authority to demand a passage that way : On this he determined to ferry a few men over in a gundola -LRB- which then lay on the bank -RRB- as soon as it could be got afloat ; the people discovering this intention , immediately jumped into her , and with axes cut through the bottom ; Col.
Leslie	PERSON	seeing this , ordered a party to drive them out of her , some of the people however , having obstinately refused to quit her , the soldiers were obliged to use force ; upon this a clergyman 1 complained of the usage .

		the inhabitants were receiving , when Col.
Leslie	PERSON	told him , that if the bridge was not immediately let down , they might expect worse treatment ; the clergyman than prevailed with the proprietor to let down the bridge , and the troops marched on , leaving a party in possession of the bridge till they returned which they soon did it being dark , and hearing nothing more of the trucks they went in search of , they then went back to
Marblehead	LOCATION	, and embarked on board the transport between eight and nine o'clock that night , and returned next day to

Authority	ORGANIZATION	should be good , but I must wait some favourable Opportunity to inform Your Lordship from whence and by what Means the
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	has been obtained .

		The Circumstance of the Eight Field Pieces at
Salem	LOCATION	led us into a Mistake , for supposing them to be brass Guns brought in from
Holland	LOCATION	or some of the foreign
Islands	LOCATION	, which Report had also given Reason to suspect ; a Detachment of two hundred Men under Lieut Colonel
-LSB- Alexander -RSB- Leslie	PERSON	was sent privately off by Water to seize them ; the Places theywere said to be concealed in were strictly searched , but no Artillery could be found .

		And we have since discovered that they had been only some old Ship Guns which had been carried away from
Salem	LOCATION	some time ago .

		The people assembled in great Numbers with Threats and abuse , but the Colonel pursued his Orders , and returned to
Marblehead	LOCATION	where he had first disembarked his Detachment ... 1 .

Boston	LOCATION	4th March 1775 .

		Sir I have the satisfaction to acquaint you with the Arrival of Lieut -LSB-
George -RSB- Dawson	PERSON	in his Majesty 's Schooner Hope from Bermudas whither he was obliged to put in , after being blown off this Coast the latter end of December , which I mentioned in my last Letter to you dated the 20th of February , and my fears thereupon : Lieutenant
Dawson	PERSON	informs me that going into Bermudas unacquainted , and no Pilot appearing , the Schooner struck upon a Rock about four Leagues S.S.E. of the West end of the Island and received some damage , but with the help of Boats , which soon came to his assistance , they got into Safety , and after repairing the Schooner Lieut.
Dawson	PERSON	sailed from Bermudas the 18th of February and arrived here the 28th following .

		I have now ordered him to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	to bring to
Boston	LOCATION	some Marine Cloathing , Camp and Tent Equipage , left on board the
Rose	PERSON	by his Majesty 's Ship Hind .

		Last Saturday Sen Night the 19th February Lieutenant -LSB-
William -RSB- Hunter	PERSON	in the
Gaspee	PERSON	returned suddenly from his Station to
Boston	LOCATION	and acquainted me that on the 13th lying at
Falmouth	LOCATION	in
Casco Bay	LOCATION	, four Seamen belonging to the Brig took the Boat from alongside and rowed towards the Shore , and that upon the Master and himself firing at the Boat to make them return , having in vain called to them for that purpose and received very abusive answers , one Man was wounded , the other three rowed the Boat ashore and deserted at
Falmouth	LOCATION	where the wounded man died ... I have ordered the
Gaspee	PERSON	to return to
Falmouth	LOCATION	and endeavour to prevail on the select men and the Inhabitants to give up the three Deserters , and , after cruizing in the Neighbourhood 'till April , to proceed to
Halifax	LOCATION	, there clean and refit ; and afterwards attend the Fisheries in the
Bay of Chaleur	LOCATION	and
Gaspee	PERSON	, and on the
Coast of Nova Scotia	ORGANIZATION	& ca I inclose the Copy of a Letter from Lieut. -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Nunn	PERSON	2 who came to
Boston	LOCATION	on the 28th of February in a hired Sloop with twenty of the Officers and people belonging to the late
Halifax Schooner	ORGANIZATION	under his Command , whose Vessel is totally lost near
Machias Harbour	LOCATION	, near the entrance of the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	.

		I also enclose a Copy of a Letter to me from Lieutenant Governor
-LSB- Cadwallader -RSB- Colden	PERSON	, to whom I sent in answer that as I had for some time past intended to send one of tbe large Ships to
New Yark	LOCATION	, as early in the Spring as possible , I should now hasten the departure of the
Asia	LOCATION	, whose Captain would cooperate with him in all things for the good of his Majesty 's Service .

		The Merchants of
New York	LOCATION	seeing so considerable a
Naval Force	ORGANIZATION	before the City will I hope be induced to import as usual , notwithstanding any illegal Combinations to oppose it , as they may be sure of their Trade having , upon their Application for that purpose , all the assistance and protection that the Kings Ships can afford ; And as the Lieutenant Governor is of opinion the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	at
New York	LOCATION	are inclined to take the Lead in endeavouring to effect a Reconciliation between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her Colonies , I shall be extremely happy if the
Asia	LOCATION	, by assisting the
Civil Government	ORGANIZATION	and protecting the property of well disposed Merchants , contributes in any respect to so desirable an Event ... The Rose and Swan in the different passages to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	have lately seized several Smugglers but we have not yet been so fortunate as to take any Arms or Ammunition .

		The
Glasgow	LOCATION	is at last got upon the Ways and will be repaired with all possible Dispatch ; about the end of next Month I hope she will be fit for Service .

		I have heard lately from all his Majesty 's Ships and Vessels under my Command to the Southward of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The Kingsfisher is removed from
Turtle Bay	LOCATION	, where I ordered her to remain during the Severity of the Winter , and by desire of Lieut. Governor
Colden	PERSON	lies in the
Stream	LOCATION	near
New York	LOCATION	.

		As Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	acquaints me there is no likelihood of dangerous Ise , being in the River this Season , I have sent him directions to remain there as long as he shall find it to be necessary for the Kings service .

		MAJOR
JOHN	PERSON
PITCAIRN	LOCATION	,
R.M.	PERSON	, TO LORD SANDWICH 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Boston	LOCATION	, 4th March 1775 .

		My Lord I had the honour to write to your Lordship about three weeks ago : nothing very material has occurred since .

		The battalion of marines are getting the better of their drunkenness .

		I hope we sha 11 be all well soon .

		I assure you my Lord I have had a disagreeable time of it : I have lived almost night and day amongst the men in their barracks for these five or six weeks past , on purpose to keep them from that pernicious rum .

		I would not have your Lordship think from this that we are worse than the other battalions here , the rum is so cheap that it debauches both navy and army , and kills many of them .

		Depend on it my Lord , it will destroy more of us than the
Yankies	ORGANIZATION	will .

		The Admiral distresses me much .

		He keeps fifty of the best men that came out with me ; forty of them are from the
Chatham	LOCATION	division , both the men and the non-commissioned officers belonging to them were volunteers , and who I was exceedingly desirous of having as they would take care of the rest and be an example to them .

		I have great use for such men , for those sent me from
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	are by no means good in any respect .

		This my Lord is not the only thing wherein the Admiral behaves strangely to me .

		Yesterday morning he sent for me and told me that I must embark such a number of marines on board the
Asia	LOCATION	.

		I told him that I should do it with the utmost pleasure , if it was in my power , but I was absolutely under the command of General
Gage	PERSON	and could order nothing but as he directed me ; that if I did , I was liable to be tried and broke for it .

		It is needless for me to tell your Lordship how he talked to me and what he said ; but be assured that nothing he says or does shall make me deviate from the rules of politeness and the respect due to an admiral and commander of a squadron .

		I waited on the General and told him what had passed : he was greatly surprised at it and could scarce believe me .

		He told me the Admiral was with him the day before , asking for those men ; that he told him he could not spare them , administration had wrote to him that there were five hundred marines sent as a reinforcement to him , and that he had not got four hundred ; and as he was every day threatened with being attacked by many thousands , he could not part with any of his troops .

		I should not have troubled your Lordship with this affair if the Admiral had not threatened to represent me to the
Board	ORGANIZATION	; and as he may , I thought it necessary in this private letter to make you master of the whole story .

		Permit me once more , before I have done with this affair , to assure your Lordship that nothing shall make me behave with incivility or want of respect to any admiral or commanding officer .

		Orders are anxiously expected from
England	LOCATION	to chastise those very bad people .

		The General had some of the Great Wigs , as they are called here , with him two days ago , when he took that opportunity of telling them , and swore to it by the living God , that if there was a single man of the King 's troops killed in any of their towns he would burn it to the ground .

		What fools you are , said he , to pretend to resist the power of
Great Britain	LOCATION	; she maintained last war three hundred thousand men , and will do the same now rather than suffer the ungrateful people of this country to continue in their rebellion .

		This behaviour of the General 's gives great satisfaction to the friends of Government .

		I am satisfied that one active campaign , a smart action , nd burning two or three of their towns , will set everything to rights .

		Nothing now , I am afraid , but this will ever convince those foolish bad people that
England	LOCATION	is in earnest .

		What a sad misfortune it was to this country , the repealing of the Stamp Act ; every friend to Government here asserts in the strongest terms that this has been the cause of all their misfortunes .

		The General had intelligence that there was at
Salem	LOCATION	some brass field pieces .

		He sent Colonel
Leslie	PERSON	with four companies of the 64 -LSB- th -RSB- in a transport to
Marblehead	LOCATION	.

		The Colonel landed , and marched with great expedition to
Salem	LOCATION	: the people beat their drums , rung their alarm bells ; but the Colonel saw none in arms but five , and those took care to get out of the way as fast as they could .

		The people behaved as I suppose they will ever do , made a great noise when there is nobody to oppose them , but the moment they see us in arms and in earnest they will talk very differently .

		The Colonel found no guns ー it is supposed a false information .

		He marched back to
Marblehead	LOCATION	and embarked for this place .

		The moment he left
Salem	LOCATION	, I am told the people got arms and paraded about , and swore if he had stayed half an hour longer they would have cut him to pieces .

		If he had continued there till now , none of them would have dared to have appeared in arms .

		I am & c.

FRANCIS LEGGE	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF NOVA SCOTIA , TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LRB- No. 33 -RRB-
Halifax	LOCATION	March 6th , 1775 My Lord ー I have not presumed to write your Lordship upon the present Commo tions in
America	LOCATION	, as I have had no particular informations , but what might be Col lected from the public Prints , and his Majesty 's Officers , & Governors in
America	LOCATION	have without Doubt given your Lordship a full & Adequate State of the matters within their respective Commands .

		But as the resolutions of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	t
Philadelphia	LOCATION	have been adopted by several Provinces ; one of which resolutions is to have no Trade with any of the Colonies that do not adopt their measures , and to induce the people of this Province to comply the
Congress Transmitted	ORGANIZATION	their resolves and their other proceedings to the Speaker of the Assembly here , but no Answer has been given them , nor any Notice taken of their Transactions , in this Province .

		This I am informed has been resented , and the Trade of this Province with them is like to be suppressed , We have had but one small Vessel twice this Winter to Trade with us ; but have been in no want of a Supply of all kinds of Necessary Provisions , Bread kind only excepted , & that in this Town only , the Country raising a sufficiency for the Supply of themselvesー As their resolves equally affect the
West India Islands	LOCATION	, as well as this Province , I have been inquiring carefully how they may in some measure be remedied
Canada	LOCATION	at present raises greater Quantity 's of Grain than they Consume , & they now export the greatest part for
Europe	LOCATION	,
Portugal	LOCATION	or
Spain	LOCATION	, haveing there a better price , & an easier Navigation than to our
West India Islands	LOCATION	; but as the produce of their Cargo 's is often returned in the produce & Manufactures of Foreign Countries , ` tho ' it might Benefit the Canadians ; is Disadvantageous to the British Tradeー I beg leave to observe to your Lordship that whilst
Canada	LOCATION	was in the Hands of the French , that Government were careful to Oblige all their Colonies to exchange their respective Products one with another , & interdicted all Foreigners from any Trade with them , & for this purpose the Town & Port of
Louisburg	LOCATION	was made an intermediate Port between
Canada	LOCATION	& their
West India Islands	LOCATION	, by which means the Navigation between
Canada	LOCATION	& the French
West Indies	LOCATION	, was made safe and Commodious .

		The
River St Lawrence	LOCATION	is shut up by Ice from the middle of November , and the
Gulf	LOCATION	full of Ice 'till May & sometimes to the end of that Month , & all Navigation totally suppressed , yet in the Summer Months not less than one Hundred Sail of Vessels were employed in carrying Provisions from
Canada	LOCATION	to
Louisburg	LOCATION	, & receiving such supplies as their wants called for , by this means also the French Established a very great Fishery at
Louisburg	LOCATION	, and a large
Trading Town	LOCATION	without haveing ten
Farmers	ORGANIZATION	on the
Island	LOCATION	.

		I am therefore fully of Opinion if the Port of
Halifax	LOCATION	was Established as an intermediate Port between
Canada	LOCATION	& the
West Indies	LOCATION	it would greatly advance the Trade and Interest of both these Provinces , & be a means of Assisting , and making up in some measure the disadvantage that will arise from the supplies being with-held from them by the rest of the Colonies .

		But to promote this effectually it will be Necessary to prevent the Canadians from sending their produce usually exported to the
West India Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, to any part of
Europe	LOCATION	except
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, the rest will follow of course , for the
West India Islands	LOCATION	will take of all their produce , & instead of Brandy , Oil & ca they will have in return Rum , Sugar , & Sundry other Articles , a mutual & Reciprocal Exchange of their own Commodities.ー The Port of
Halifax	LOCATION	being on every Account the best Port in
America	LOCATION	for safety & Convenience , accessable at all Seasons of the Year , is in its situation in respect to the
West Indies	LOCATION	, so placed that a Direct course may be made to any of the
West India Islands	LOCATION	, & in generall shorter passages than from any other Port in
America	LOCATION	, here the Canadian comeing from the
West Indies	LOCATION	may safely resort till the Navigation of the
Gulf	LOCATION	and River becomes open & Safe.ー I beg leave further to Observe to your Lordship , that the Fishery carried on by the Inhabitants of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
New Hampshire	LOCATION	is principally on the Coasts of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	; few Fish are caught to the Westward of
Cape Sables	LOCATION	; by this Fishery they are inabled from these Colonies to supply
Spain	LOCATION	&
Portugal	LOCATION	, & other European Powers in the Mediterranian , the principal returns from thence are the products and Manufactures of those Powers which are imported into their Provinces by which means they are fully Supplied with those Goods prohibited by Acts of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, to be imported directly from thence into any part of
America	LOCATION	: by the Multiplicity of their ports , and the great propensity of the Inhabitants in general to that Trade Notwithstanding the Number of Officers there to prevent it , & a Number of Cruizers , they find means to elude all their Vigilance.ー As the
Port of Halifax	LOCATION	is situated in the center of the Fishery , it might have been conjectured , that it would in time have Drawn the Principal part of the Fishery into this Port , but Unfortunately for us , we have had no other Fishermen that has resorted and settled here , but the very refuse of the Fishermen who could not get an employ at
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, and the
Contraband Trade so Beneficial	ORGANIZATION	to the other Colonies , & which has given them so great an Advantage , has prevented .

		a resort of Industrious Fishermen from
New England	LOCATION	.

		The remark I would observe to your Lordship on this Head , is , That if the
Port of Halifax	LOCATION	, was for a limitted Time Established as the only intermediate Port between the European Powers and the Colonies for the importation of such of their Products as
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	might allow on the Payment of certain Duties , a very Considerable Revenue would be secured to the Crown .

		The Fishery be Transferred from
New England	LOCATION	to this Province ; The very Funds of that Contraband Trade Distroyed , and the illegal Importation of Foreign produce more effectually suppressed.ー I am fully persuaded if these measures could be carried into Execution , it would make a Material Alteration in favour of these two Colonies , & be much more advantageous as well to the
West India Island	LOCATION	, as the
British Trade	ORGANIZATION	, all which I humbly Submit to your Lordships Considerationー I have the Honour to be with the great Respect My Lord -LSB- & c. -RSB- Fran s

		Sir / A Vessel being turn 'd out of the harbour with Kings Provisions May and certainly will put us to great difficultys to Obtain others for the like services .

		the last was procured from a Gentm in

		I conceive Vessels loaded with no other Cargoe but for the use of Government have by the Act of parliament a right to come into the Harbour ; I now send you the Names of two Vessells daily expected with Provisions from
New York	LOCATION	, one Sloop Susanah Stephen Weeks Master , & Sloop Speedwell Thomas

Boston	LOCATION	7th March 1775 I had the Honor of your Excellency 's Letter of yesterday , and beg leave , in answer , to represent to you that The Act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	allowing no Supplies of Provisions or Fuel , to be brought for the Inhabitants of
Boston	LOCATION	but such as are cleared at
Marblehead	LOCATION	, and Stores for the Use of Government only in Vessels Commissioned by or in the immediate pay of the King ; 2 My orders to the Captains of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Ships under my Command are consonant to these Regulations , and nothing is permitted to pass in or out but as the Law directs ; except by License under My hand and Seal which has always readily been granted when the King 's Service would suffer by too strictly following the Letter of the Law ; and I am greatly chagrined to find that in doing our Duty afloat We have occasioned any embarrassments in Your Excellency 's
Military Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		However I can not help thinking this Might have been avoided by the Contractor 's acquainting your Excellency , at an early period , that he expected this Vessel to arrive from
New York	LOCATION	; Your Excellency may be assured that I have great satisfaction in facilitating rather than impeding the Entrance of Supplies for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, where the Act is defective or not sufficiently explicit ; And whenever Your Excellency is pleased to send Me the Names of Vessels bringing Provisions or Stores for the

		From the situation of the times & the distance of the place I was , to escort them to Singly you will suppose the attempt in this rebellious place must have been attended with the greatest hazard of my life , but as the object of His Majesty 's Service -LRB- which I 've much at heart -RRB- by shewing a precedent , I should be wanting in duty upon so urgent , an occasion was I not to exert myself , were the consequences attending be of the utmost Injury to my personal safety , in this
Providence	LOCATION	interfered when I add no man was ever nigher suffering Publick Execution , when I felt the inhumane barbarity of an incensed Mobb upwards of three hours from whom I experienced the utmost Brutality without the least lenity whatsoever .

		The appointment of Surveyor sure was never intended I should fall a victim in a Country without any support , where the Civil Magistrate dare not execute his authority , as every man here is upon an equallity , in this what can an Officer do who is bound by Oath to perform the trust reposed in him when I assert this and assure you I am the first ever executed his Commission here as being the first resident ever here before from your Honours Candor I doubt not you will pitty my situation which I affirm is in the utmost danger , when I say this & can hardly get a house to receive me since I made the Seizure what must you imagine I undergo when I experienced those unhumane hardships.ー That your Honors may not be further deceived in the appointment I affirm it unnecessary , tho ' the Smugling Trade carried on here is very extensive particularly between this & the Province of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, where Ships I am well informed touch in at
Duck Creek Land	LOCATION	what they have for this Province to avoid the
Customs &	ORGANIZATION	so proceed up
Delaware	LOCATION	to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	some part below which place lyes a Sloop of War which should prevent it , if His Majesty 's Officers do not exert themselves , where they have protection what am I singly to do unsupported in an inland Country abounded daily with Counterband trade.ー From these Circumstances Honble Sirs it is impossible to act , nor at the same time can I think of perjuring myself by overlooking things I 'm bound to prosecute , but
Cheerfuly	PERSON	will I execute his
Majestys Interest	ORGANIZATION	provided assistance notwithstanding the Consequences for the present it is impossible nor dare I return as yet to my station from apprehensions of a further assault in this I must beg my speedy removal elswhere or leave of absence to return to
Europe	LOCATION	which I doubt not your Honours will immediately comply with.ー I 'm here now seeking an Asylum under the Governor till other measures are adopted for my Security in whom I find everything I can expect from the times & from the barbarous treatment I 've met with am mostly confined to my bed which is very expensive exclusive of my private Losses which I 've no prospect of ever regaining except thro ' your Honors benevolence & good offices in my behalf when I remind you its hard I should suffer in my person exclusive of property in prosecuting what I was bound to perform , should I meet with no other attonement , I flatter myself from the Deposition you will approve of my Conduct , & that you will never have reason to Censure me in the execution of my Office hereafter notwithstanding this Miscarriage by a Superiour force it may have a little effect by the issue of a Proclamation .

Waggoners	ORGANIZATION	put their Horses expeditiously too and drive off ー that this Deponent being almost sensless from the pressure of their Bodies when the Cry of Tar and Feathers echoed , he attempted to struggle hard to avoid the Operation and could perceive them brought from the Mill of said
Gallop	PERSON	, who by this time had absconded , and that after putting a quantity on his Head and
Cloaths	PERSON	they dragged this Deponent several times on the Ground to the danger of his Life , that they threatened to Drown him if he would not drink with them which he reluctantly comply 'd with .

		At this time they were dragging this Deponent to a Pond that afterwards they got a Horse saddled and mounted this Deponent several times with his Face to the Horses Tail shouting Liberty and driving him about said
Mill Yard	PERSON	.

		that at Intervals this Deponent had several Swabbs of
Tarr	PERSON	put upon his Cloaths and
Stockings	PERSON	, that he several times cried out , not to Murder him & particularly to the
Miller Gallop for Assistance	ORGANIZATION	, and requested him to admit this Deponent into his
House	ORGANIZATION	which was refused , tho ' he promised faithfully not to pursue the Waggons , they said they would take care this Deponent should not ー That they then , by
Force	ORGANIZATION	, mounted this Deponent several times on a raft of Wood supported by a number of People on their Shoulders carrying him about in that brutal Manner ー That this Deponent often intreated Mercy , and accused them of robbing him , but in return received the most opprobrious Language ー That this Deponent being almost exhausted , with the Treatment he had received , begged a drink of Water several times which was refused him .

		ー that he often entreated several People on Horseback to intercede for him , who at first he imagined were only Spectators , but found himself mistaken as they seemed to be abettors of the Treatment he received .

		that after this they conducted him , or rather dragged him to another
Pond of Water	LOCATION	, as this Deponent imagines to be about a Mile from said Mill , where they were going to execute more of their Barbarity here this Deponent was so exhusted he was obliged to intreat Mercy on his Knees most fervently , that this Deponent received several Kicks on the Feet , some violent Pressures and a little Tar , continually insulting him and speaking Words tending to high Treason ー They then conducted this Deponent about a Mile further upon the main Road leading to George Town ー and struck off into the
Woods	PERSON	, he believes about half a Mile from the Road , damning him repeatedly , shouting Liberty and
Duck Creek	LOCATION	for ever ー , That after hauling this Deponant some distance , several Motions were made against this Deponents Life , threatening to Execute him , or at least tye him to a Tree til Morning if he did not comply with the following infamous Requisitions , on compliance with which this Deponent was to be set at
Liberty	ORGANIZATION	ー Who gave him This Commission ?

		Immediately to quit the Province , and inform -LSB- Lord -RSB- North if he had been in his place he would have met with worse Treatment , never to accept the like
Office	ORGANIZATION	again , with many other Words tending to the same Purport all which this Deponent peremptorily refused , alledging they had treated him so very inhumanly that he disregarded his Life as not worth holding on such Terms and was now resigned to suffer such further Punishment as his Fate decreed ー The Speaker for the Mob upon this Occasion -LRB- who this Deponent believes belonged to the Mill -RRB- made a motion for conducting him to
Duck Creek	LOCATION	in order that he might undergo another new Suit , and led him from the Woods back in the same cruel Manner , escorted as before , to the main Road , but this Deponent could observe that many of the Former Horse Men had absconded & others coming from the
Cross Roads	ORGANIZATION	shouting & Whistling ー That this Deponent being so very Weak , from the barbarous Usage , often intreated to sit down a Minute but was refused ー that they then dragged this Deponent through a Pool of Water on the Road & that , from Appearance , many of them were Men of Property ー This Deponent being certain of further Injury to his Person , as Horsement were passing & repassing continually being then near
George Town	LOCATION	this Deponent intreated Releasement but was refused , alledging he was to be given up a Second time to the Brutality of another set of Men ー This Deponent approaching the Town he began to apprehend his Life in the utmost Danger , the People assembling and crying out an
Informer Tar & Feathers	ORGANIZATION	that this Deponent providentially seeing Light in the House of one
Pillotson	LOCATION	in
George Town	LOCATION	cried out incessantly Murder , upon which his
Mouth	PERSON	was attempted to be stopped , which brought forth numbers of People with Lights ー The Assailants crying Out Lights & dragged this Deponent along ー he then made a vigorous Effort & pushed amongst some Gentlemen whose Protection he implored , that he believes he was upwards of three Hours in the Hands of a Mob suffering the most inhuman Treatment ー Notwithstanding this Deponents sufferings , his Lodgings were surrounded all Night & he was apprehensive of being again Attacked .

		he therefore stood on the Defensive 'til almost Morning , that on the ensuing Day he received frequent Information of another Assault being intended that Evening by a Number in
George Town	LOCATION	, which caused this Deponent to retreat to the
Woods	PERSON	and secret himself until the Fifth ー That
George Town	PERSON	being in his District & where his Duty may frequently call him , this Deponent apprehends from the Language of the People if he returns he is not to exp : : : ct Lenity , nor can he think of returning to his Department 'til proper Measures are adopted for his Security in prosecuting His Majestys Service ー That this Deponent has reason to believe said
Oliver Gallop	PERSON	was concerned in this Deponents barbarous Treatment for Reasons assigned before ー That this Deponent has never as yet received any of the Stolen Goods but has received Information that the Names of the
Waggoners	ORGANIZATION	are Shahahan & White the former a Strong looking Man & the latter lower Sized and that they both belong to

Robert Stratford Byrn	PERSON	has received as an Officer of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	from a licentious Mob , renders it absolutely necessary that you should as speedily as possible be furnished with a clear and precise Account of the matter , for which purpose we beg leave to transmit a Copy of his Deposition , taken before a Provincial Magistrate , the original will be forwarded by the Governor as soon as he shall have laid it before the
Council	ORGANIZATION	in order that a Proclamation may issue for apprehending and bringing to Justice the parties concerned within this Government .

		It is unfortunate for Mr.
Byrn	PERSON	that he can not particularise a single offender except two
Waggoners	ORGANIZATION	, who are both non Residents .

		So soon as Mr
Byrn	PERSON	related his unhappy situation , no time was lost before two Magistrates were called upon , who immediately declared their readiness to exert themselves in his behalf , in case he could name any of the Inhabitants within their County who had committed such a daring and outrageous breach of the Laws .

England	LOCATION	which will enable him to lay his sufferings before the Lords of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー at his request we also inclose , for your perusal , his Letter to the Collector , written immediately after his releasement from the Mob .

		We take the liberty of intimating to your Honors , that we have reason to believe , from the Tenor of Mr
Byrne	PERSON	's past Conduct , that his Finances will not admit of his departure from this Province with Reputation .

		Should you think proper to point out any different mode for us to pursue than those already adopted , as matters arc now circumstanced on this Continent , you will please to signify your pleasure therein .

Williamsburg	LOCATION	, March 10 .

		This day the libel exhibited against the schooner
Wray	PERSON	galley , laden with 84 hogsheads of tobacco , by
Henry Collins	PERSON	,
Esq	PERSON	; commander of his Majesty 's armed schooner
Magdalen	ORGANIZATION	, came on to be heard in the court of Admiralty .

		The cause of seizure alledged was a supposed violation of an act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, in not having given bond , before any tobacco had been taken on board , that the same should be unladen in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the town of
Berwick	LOCATION	upon Tweed , or some British plantation .

		Upon consideration of the arguments , the Judge determined that no country craft was required to give such bond ; & therefore , the libelled vessel being in that predicament , was acquitted .

		The prosecutor has entered an appeal ; and probable cause of seizure being certified , the respondents were ordered to pay costs .

Samuel Lee	PERSON	, a Boatman of this town , employed and accompanied by
Ichabod B. Barnet	PERSON	, Esq ; -LRB- son in law to
Robert Murray	PERSON	-RRB- appear from very strong circumstances , to have been the persons concerned in that affair , who went from
New York	LOCATION	on Monday last -LSB- March 6 -RSB- to the ship .

		We have had
Lee	PERSON	before us , he appears greatly perplexed , but can not be persuaded to give any clear information of the matter , he being under an apprehension that he by that means may be the ruin of some particular persons in
New York	LOCATION	.

		ー The said
Barnet	ORGANIZATION	was also before us , but refused to answer the questions proposed to him ; he only offered to swear -LRB- if it would be any satisfaction to us -RRB- that no goods from the
Beulah	LOCATION	were landed at this town , which , however , we did not accept .

		And there is reason to believe that
Lee	PERSON	would have given information , had it not been for said
Barnet	ORGANIZATION	, who , it appears , has prevented him from making the desired discovery .

		We have only to add that the boat employed on this occasion , is the property of
Isaac Woodruff	PERSON	,

Samuel -RSB- Greaves	PERSON	now at

Taylor	PERSON	too , and on boarding him demanded what he had on board , to which he answered only rum and limes , but civilly told them they might go down and look ; they then demanded his papers , which were produced authentic , but this not satisfying them , they entered the cabbin , wherein were several hundred pounds cash , which
Taylor	PERSON	, no doubt , justly thinking proper to have his eye toward , went after them to the cabbin , door without going down ; whereupon he was immediately menaced and insulted , as suspecting the honour of the king 's men , and although he made no other than a moderate civil reply , as several passengers on board can testify , he was immediately furiously attacked and knocked down , where he was beaten in a most inhuman manner till the deck was besmeared with blood , and at the same time shamefully insulted with the infernal language common to such crews , -LRB- and which but for offending the civilized ear might be repeated -RRB- they then threatened to throw him overboard and drown him , took the command of his boat , and after gratifying their malice by towing her about in the river , took her along side the schooner , where the illustrious Captain detained her a considerable time , insulting and abusing the skipper , and justifying and applauding the conduct of his heroic men , who ` had thus brought him a common shallop with two or three men on board , without the least appearance of clandestine conduct ; after the gallant Captain with his crew had somewhat glutted their rancour , they dismissed the shallop , but
Taylor	PERSON	was so wounded and abused that he was not able to conduct her , yet , bythe assistance of those on board she was got up to this city , and he afterwards conveyed home to

JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF
NORTH CAROLINA	LOCATION	, TO GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	1 Sir ,
North Carolina	LOCATION	New Bern March 16th 1775 I should have paid my respects to your Excellency oftner since your return to your command in
America	LOCATION	if I had not been restrained by the consideration of your having your hands too full of employment to admit of complimentary intrusions .

		The state of this Province has been till lately so perfectly like that of the neighbouring Colonies that I have had nothing material to communicate to your Excellency in relation to it , and in your present circumstances I thought it unavailing to detail to you the growth and progress of sedition and revolt in this Country that hath been in no sort particular , while I was assured your Excellency could afford me no effectual remedy against the present Spirit of Licentiousness The case Sir is now altered ; the people in some parts of this Country begin to open their eyes and see through the artifices and delusions by which they have been misled , and they discover good dispositions to renounce the power and authority of the committees that have been appointed by the recommendation of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	which have proceeded in some instances to arbitrary and intolerable exertions of power , and they appear inclined to disengage themselves entirely from the bondage which those little combinations seem to be preparing for them .

		Many of the Inhabitants in several Counties of this Province have already by their addresses to me disclaimed all obedience to those illegal tribunals and expressed in the strongest terms the most loyal and dutiful attachment to his Majesty and the firmest resolution to maintain and defend the Constitution and Laws of their country .

		I have given every encouragement in my power to these good presages and I have no doubt that the people in the Western Counties of this Province , which are by far the most populous , will generally unite in support of Government in this case , and with the aid of a considerable Body of Highlanders in the midland counties who have already given me the best proofs of their attachment to government and in whose zeal and steadfast Loyalty I can safely confide if your Excellency shall assist me with two or three Stand of arms and good store of ammunition , of which last we are totally destitute , I will be answerable to maintain the Soverignty of this Country to his Majesty if the present spirit of resistance which runs high in
Virginia	LOCATION	and has infected many parts of this Colony should urge matters to the extremity that the
People of New England	ORGANIZATION	seem to be meditating if any credit may be given to the insulting Gasconading of their abettors among us .

		As the movements of this part of the continent will be governed by the impulses of the people of
New England	LOCATION	your Excellency by your observation of them will be a judge of the proper season to strengthen the hands of the friends to Government here with the aids I have mentioned .

		I am told it has been moved in one of the Committees to attack
Fort Johnston	PERSON	, but the motion was overruled and I believe they will think of it often before they execute such a design .

		If contrary to my expectations however an attempt of this sort is made , it will be to be lamented that the Fort is totally unprovided with powder but I am sure under every circumstance I may expect the most resolute defence of it from the Gallantry of Captain -LSB-
John A. -RSB- Collet	PERSON	ー to whom I wish your Excellency may think it expedient to send a supply of powder .

		Mrs
Martin	PERSON	desires to join me in best Compliments to your Excellency and to
Mrs Gage	PERSON	and your Family I have the honor to be & c.

		Not that the place is an object to Government but upon the whole Burthensome nor will it be ever possible where a Country is so divided for honest Men to Act without the Assistance of a Military force , as nothing dwells amongst us in the Shadow of Magistry notwithstanding the prodigious Counterband Trade carried on here between the two Provinces which they have enjoyed without Molestation a Centry past & should not other measures be adopted to prevent it rest assured Honble Sirs it will be ever claimed as their Birth right This I affirm by a watchful Observation ー My private Losses sustained by this Barbarous affair in
Cloaths Money New Fuzee &	ORGANIZATION	ca may amount to about # 20 Sterling exclusive of other Expences in coming here & Doctors attendance nor dare I return to get some Necessaries in dread of another Assault when Fled leaving every thing I possessed behind ; Compassionatly I entreat your Honors benevolence that you wont see me a Sufferer as the Losses I sustained was in the execution of my Duty From your Honors Candor you must Suppose my stay here at this Juncture attended with many Inconveniencies & ca I can not be of Service to the State at present from the low State of my Health owing to the unhumanc Treatment I recieved I must entreat your Honors permition of returning to
Europe	LOCATION	for 2 years or till such times as the Temper of the People are abated that I may return with safty again & as I am unfortunately involved on my
Department	ORGANIZATION	to about # 60 Sterling I must beg your Honors indulgence to advance it on my pay that I may quit them more Honourable than they treated me which should I be unfortunately ordered to my
Department	ORGANIZATION	again may make me meet with a more favourable reception I rely on your Honors good officrs in endeavouring to bring the Delinquents to

SOUTH CAROLINA GAZETTE	ORGANIZATION	, MONDAY , MARCH 27 , 1775
Charlestown	LOCATION	, March 20 .

		Last Tuesday -LSB- March 14 -RSB- Mr.
Robert Smyth	PERSON	, Merchant ,
Master Smyth	PERSON	, his son , and
Master Ward	PERSON	son of
John Ward	PERSON	,
Esq	PERSON	, returned here from
London	LOCATION	, in the snow Proteus , Capt.
Papley	PERSON	, having touched at
Falmouth	LOCATION	and St.
Christopher	PERSON	's by the Way .

		The said Vessel having on board -LRB- besides 7
Cases of Merchandise	ORGANIZATION	, said to be Globes and mathematical Instruments consigned to Mr.
Robert Wells	PERSON	, 1 hogshead , 1 Puncheon , 7 casks , 13 Cases , 5 Crates , and 1 Bottle , said to contain Drugs and
Medicines	ORGANIZATION	, consigned to Mr.
Edward Gunter	PERSON	-RRB- 2 Puncheons , 1 Box , 1
Tierce	ORGANIZATION	, 40 Bundles , 9 Cases , and 7 Hampers , said to contain
Household Furniture	ORGANIZATION	, and 2 Horses , belonging to Mr.
Smyth	PERSON	, all which he declared , were brought out by him on the Supposition that it was not meant , by the
Continental Association	ORGANIZATION	, to prohibit the Importation of such Articles , and had been in Use in his Family in
England	LOCATION	; and the
Committee of Observation	ORGANIZATION	requested the Sense of the
General Committee	ORGANIZATION	respecting said Horses and Furniture .

		This matter accordingly came under the Consideration of the
General Committee	ORGANIZATION	on Wednesday Evening , 33 Members present ; when , after a long Debate , whether the landing the said Horses and Furniture , might not be construed a Violation of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	, there appeared to be an equal Number for and against that Opinion , and the Question was put , Whether Mr.
Smyth	PERSON	's Horses , under the Circumstances they had been represented , might be Landed , it was carried in the Affirmative by the Chairman 's casting Vote .

		It was at the same
Time	ORGANIZATION	resolved , without a Division upon the Question , that such Part of Mr.
Smyth	PERSON	's Furniture as , upon inspection by the
Committee of Observation	ORGANIZATION	, should appear to them , to have been in Use in his family -LRB- but no other -RRB- might also be landed .

		The next Morning a great Number of the Inhabitants appeared extremely uneasy , lest , from the Admission of the Horses , it should be suggested , that there was an Inclination in this Colony to depart from the
Association	ORGANIZATION	; they feared , that the Conduct of the People , which had always been consistent , and who continued remarkable strict in their Adherence to the Resolves and Recommendations of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, might in this Instance , be misrepresented abroad , their Zeal for the Reputation of their Country threw them into great Agitation ; none meant the least Reflection on the Conduct of their
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, but all wished that the two Horses might not be landed ; yet they were then at a Loss what Measure might be most proper to pursue .

		On Friday Morning , however , a Petition was agreed on , and , after having 256 Names subscribed thereto , presented to the Chairman of the
General Committee	ORGANIZATION	, in the following Words : `` We , a Number of the Inhabitants of Charles-town , conceive , that our Liberties at this Time depend on our Unanimity and Confidence in our Committee , who , we doubt not , in all things , will act according to the best of their Judgment for the
Publick Good	ORGANIZATION	.

		But your Petitioners are informed that , by a Vote carried by a very small Majority , divers Horses and Furniture are permitted to be landed ; which many persons , who have the liberty of
America	LOCATION	much at heart , think an infringement of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	entered into by the
General Congress	ORGANIZATION	: In order , therefore , to quiet the Minds of the People , we pray that there may be a Reconsideration of the said Matter in a full Committee . ''

		In consequence of this Petition , the said
Committee	ORGANIZATION	was summoned to meet that evening ; but no more than 42 Members then attending , it was thought advisable to adjourn till Monday morning , 9 o'Clock , in order that , if it should be thought necessary to reconsider the Matter , it might be done at a very full Meeting .

		Accordingly this Morning a very full Committee met , not less than 70 members being present , when the above Petition was taken into Consideration ー the Resolves of Wednesday , respecting the Horses , rescinded , by a majority of one vote ; and a Resolution entered into , that they should be sent back , with the Merchandise and Furniture -LRB- if any -RRB- that should appear not to have been in Use .

		A general satisfaction was expressed upon this Occasion , and the Quiet of the community seems to be perfectly restored .

		MINUTES OF THE
NORFOLK	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF OBSERVATION 1
Committee Chamber	ORGANIZATION	,
Norfolk	LOCATION	,
Va.	LOCATION	, March 21 , 1775 .

		To the Publick .

		We , the
Committee for Norfolk Borough	ORGANIZATION	, find ourselves under the disagreeable necessity of publishing to the world the conduct of Captain
Sampson	PERSON	, Master of the
Snow Elizabeth	PERSON	, from
Bristol	LOCATION	.

		It is not in one instance alone that he has discovered his opposition to the measures adopted for the security of our rights and liberties , nor can he , on any account , justify his repeated prevarications .

		It is not our business to take notice of his passionate and disrespectful behaviour towards this Committee , nor his indiscret conduct without doors .

		We shall confine ourselves to the relation of the following facts : On the 13th day of February he informed the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of his arrival with a quantity of Salt , that his Snow wanted repairs , and as he should find it necessary to heave her down here , he demanded the consent of this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to store the Salt till the Snow could be refitted .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, after careful inquiries , -LRB- some of his answers to which we find to be false , -RRB- did , at length , consent , upon condition the Salt should be taken on board again as soon as possible , which Captain
Sampson	PERSON	promised to do .

		Thus matters rested till the 8th of March , when this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	were surprised with information , that he had given bond at the Custom-House , and was taking in Lumber without the Salt .

		He was sent for , and after discovering a great degree of heat , did , at length , give his repeated promise to take the Salt on board as soon as possible , and that he would begin the next day .

		More than a week , however , has elapsed , and he has as yet complied with no part of his promise , nor taken any of the Salt on board again , but has actually applied for protection to the Ship-of-War now in this harbour , under whose stern the Snow lies , where it appears he intends to load with Grain .

		2 We , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, do therefore declare Captain
Sampson	PERSON	a violator of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	, and an enemy to American liberty ; and we trust the Merchants , Planters , and Skippers of Vessels in this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, will make him feel their righteous indignation , by breaking off all kinds of dealings with him , and that they will , in no wise , be aiding or assisting in procuring a cargo for a man , who , from the whole tenour of his late conduct , has openly set the good people of this Country at defiance , and contributed his utmost endeavours to destroy their most essential interests .

Hayes	PERSON	-LSB-
Edenton	LOCATION	-RSB- 2d April 1775 Dear Sir I hope this will meet you safely arrived at the Grand Scene of Action , where you will have a most important part to act .

		2 The conduct of the Yorkers seems to have given the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	hopes of effecting a Division in the
Councils of America	ORGANIZATION	, imagining that a Majority of the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	speak the sense of the people , from some late proceedings in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	it would appear that
Administration	ORGANIZATION	would gladly make a drawn Battle of it could they get an opening at which they might with decency creep out , without incurring the imputation of acting inconsistently but this I am afraid will be impossible while the people of
America	LOCATION	are so much and so justly irritated , unless the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, without giving up essentials , could by appearing to concede bring about a Negotiation , it is to be hoped the present Wound might be closed at least for some time , and it is obvious of how great importance it is to gain time , as the rapid increase of inhabitants in
America	LOCATION	will for some years exceed all Calculation and will enable us in the Course of a few years to ask with a better Grace than at present greater immunities than are at this time thought of by the most sanguine of our friends .

		We have been alarmed with an Account of an Engagement between a Detachment of 1200 of G. -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	's Troops and a body of the
N. England Militia	LOCATION	, but I suspend my belief till further accounts to confirm it .

		3 Old Barter is just arrived from Pool and has imported some merchandize I have not heard what , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	were sitting this afternoon deliberating what steps were to be taken with him , 4 I have not heard their determination , I suppose
Bob Smith	PERSON	will inform you he is among them .

		I would wish to know by the earliest oppertunity whether any probable plan is thought of among the Merchants for procuring an importation of Goods this Fall or whether any possibility of giving such conditional orders as can with safety be executed , you know my reason for desiring this information and hope you will not refuse giving me your sentiments on the subject ... .

		pray let me hear from you what is doing and what is expected to be done , and believe me always Dear Sr -LSB- & c. -RSB-

New York	LOCATION	, April 6 , 1775 During the Ship Buelah 's stay in the
Bay	LOCATION	she was continually watched by a Sub-Committee , and did not enter .

		But while she lay at the Hook waiting for a fair wind , the night before she departed threatened a storm ; and as the Boat , on board of which the
Sub-Committee	ORGANIZATION	attended , was not so well provided with ground-tackling as the Ship , the Boat was obliged to go into a cove of safety , at some distance from the Ship .

		The owners , 2 who had some goods on board , having previously meditated a plan to land them availed themselves of this opportunity , and effected it in the night .

		Of this they were suspected , and our Sub-Committee of Observation , and the
Committee of Elizabeth Town	ORGANIZATION	, having got a clue to a discovery , the owners confessed the matter upon oath .

		Our citizens were so enraged at them for the horrid deed , that it was with great difficulty they were prevailed upon not to banish them .

		The fearful apprehensions of these persons , and the terms on which they are suffered to abide here , are fully expressed in the printed papers which you have herewith .

		This is the only violation of the Association we have had since it took place .

		The punishment they now and will endure is sufficient to deter any man , however base , from another breach .

		MINUTES OF THE COMMITTEE OF INSPECTION OF
FALMOUTH	LOCATION	,
MAINE	LOCATION	PROVINCE 1
Committee of Inspection Chamber Falmouth	ORGANIZATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, April 10 , 1775 To hold a man up as an object of general detestation , to deprive him of the benefits that result from society , is disagreeable , is painful ; but , on the other hand , to neglect the interest of our Country , to disappoint the just expectations for our constituents is dishonourable and base .

		The
Committee of Inspection	ORGANIZATION	of the Town of
Falmouth	LOCATION	, therefore come forward , to discharge the duty they owe the publick , and the trust reposed in them by their fellow-citizens .

		On Thursday , the 2d ult. , the
Sloop John	PERSON	and
Mary	PERSON	,
Henry Hughes	PERSON	, Master , arrived here from
Bristol	LOCATION	, supposed to have goods on board for Captain
Thomas Coulson	PERSON	, of this place ; and as the late
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	had , by their
Association	ORGANIZATION	, prohibited the importation of any goods from
Great Britain	LOCATION	after the first day of February last , this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, chosen by the said
Town of Falmouth	ORGANIZATION	to observe the conduct of all persons in said
Town	ORGANIZATION	touching said
Association	ORGANIZATION	, immediately convened , and after employing some persons to see that nothing was taken out of said Sloop during their debates , they proceeded to consider the circumstances of the case ; and being informed by Captain
Coulson	PERSON	that said Vessel had on board sundry Rigging , Sails , and Stores , sent him by Mr.
Garnet	PERSON	, Merchant in
Bristol	LOCATION	, for a new Ship lately built here by said
Coulson	PERSON	, for said
Garnet	PERSON	, the said
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, after a full and serious consideration of the matter , gave it as their opinion , that his taking said Rigging and Sails out of the vessel in which they arrived , and appropriating them to rig his new Ship , in order to send her to
England	LOCATION	, would be a violation of the
Continental Association	ORGANIZATION	, and therefore that the said Rigging ,
Sails and Stores	ORGANIZATION	, ought forthwith to be sent back again , without breaking any of the packages thereof .

		Of this opinion the said
Coulson	PERSON	had due notice , but not making any preparations to comply therewith , the said
Committee	ORGANIZATION	again convened on Tuesday following , viz ; the 7th ult .

		Captain
Coulson	PERSON	then attended , agreeable to the desire of this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, and being asked why he had not sent away the goods , agreeable to the opinion of this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, founded on the aforesaid
Association	ORGANIZATION	, he said , because it was not for his interest ; and further said that the vessel wanted repairs , and therefore was unfit to go to sea , and that he did not choose to procure another , or to send back the said Rigging and Sails , otherwise than by rigging his said new Ship with them , and thus to send them back in the said new Ship ; but that he would consent to have them stored at the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	's risk until the vessel was repaired , and then he would re-ship them , and send them out of the harbour .

		But being asked whether he would send them back to
Bristol	LOCATION	, he declined giving the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	any assurance that he would , though he was willing to send back the two hogsheads of Lines which came in said vessel .

		This
Committee	ORGANIZATION	then sent for a
Committee of Carpenters	ORGANIZATION	, Riggers , and
Caulkers	PERSON	, who had been on board to view her , at the request of a number of the inhabitants of this Town , and they informed us that the vessel wanted some repairs , but that in their opinion , she might be repaired , fit to return , in about two days , without taking out the goods .

		Upon which the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	passed the following Resolve , and sent a copy of it to Captain
Coulson	PERSON	, viz : That seven days be allowed said
Coulson	PERSON	, from this time , to repair said vessel , and to make the necessary preparations for seding her back ; and if he does not at the end of that term -LRB- wind and weather permitting -RRB- send said vessel out of this harbour to proceed to
Bristol	LOCATION	, this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	will forthwith cause the truth of the case to be published , agreeable to the
Continental Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the expiration of said term , viz : on the evening of the 14th ult. , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	met again , and although a deposition , signed by several persons , some of whom were merchants , masters of vessels , and ship-carpenters , was then handed into this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, purporting that said vessel was unfit to go to sea until the goods were taken out , and she thoroughly repaired , yet it appeared that Captain
Coulson	PERSON	had not taken due care to get said Sloop repaired , nor had endeavoured to procure another , in which to reship the goods to
Bristol	LOCATION	, and would give the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	no assurance that he would send them back , in any other manner than he at first proposed .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	then adjourned to the 15th ult. , and then passed the following Vote , viz : That if Captain
Coulson	PERSON	will re-ship the aforesaid goods in some other vessel , and send them back immediately , without breaking any of the packages , it will be satisfactory to this Committee .

		To this Captain
Coulson	PERSON	-LRB- who was again desired to attend , to hear the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	's determination -RRB- would not consent , though one of this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	offered him a vessel gratis , to carry them to
Halifax	LOCATION	or

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	, SECRETARY OF THE BRITISH
ADMIRALTY	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	11th .

		April 1775 The Hope Schooner has brought from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	the Tents and Camp Equipage & c for the Marines , and is placed at the entrance into this Harbour between Point
Shirley	PERSON	and
Deer Island	LOCATION	.

		Upon the death of the man who deserted from the
Gaspee	LOCATION	at
Falmouth	LOCATION	-LRB- of which I acquainted you in my Letter March 4th and of the Court Martial thereupon -RRB- some of the Inhabitants of the place thought fit to threaten to destroy the Gaspee or any other Kings Ship that should come there ; insomuch that Lieut -LSB-
William -RSB- Hunter	PERSON	judging it unsafe to send a Boat on shore , and wishing to avoid the
Civil Power	ORGANIZATION	there taking
Cognizance of the Seaman	PERSON	's death , returned to
Boston	LOCATION	; Upon his Acquittal I instantly ordered him back to
Falmouth	LOCATION	, partly with a View of getting the Deserters , but principally to check the Insolence of threatening the Kings Ships , by assuring them that if they committed any act of violence against the persons of his Majesty 's Officers or Seamen or destroyed any of the
Kings Stores	ORGANIZATION	, that I would take the severest Measures to distress them the Law would allow .

		This Message had the proper Effect ; they reply 'd civilly to Lieut.
Hunter	PERSON	's Letter , and the people of the
Gaspee	LOCATION	went ashore as usual without being insulted , but the Deserters were not in the Town , and the
Gaspee	PERSON	after remaining on the Coast her appointed time proceeded to
Halifax	LOCATION	to get ready to attend the Fisheries this Summer in the Bays of Chaleur and
Gaspee	LOCATION	.

		I had fully purposed to send the
Asia	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	according to what I formerly mentioned to you and Lieut. Governor
-LSB- Cadwallader -RSB- Colden	PERSON	, but a Vessel arriving at
Salem	LOCATION	in six weeks from
Falmouth	LOCATION	with Accounts of the Proceedings of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	to the middle of February , 2 and of the Falcon being either sailed or upon the point of departing , I determined to wait her Arrival before I sent any of the large Ships from this
Harbour	LOCATION	, in order to be in a Condition fully and effectually to execute any Orders I might have the Honour to receive from their Lordships .

		The
Asia	LOCATION	's Decks and sides have been caulked , she is completed with
Stores	ORGANIZATION	, and is in all respect fit for Service ; I have ordered her for the present to lie in
Kingroad	LOCATION	.

		We have been obliged to lighten the
Somerset	LOCATION	by taking out her Guns , Cables , & c. Upon stripping the sheathing from her Bottom , we found the Ocham in her seams entirely rotten and the Butt Ends open ; these Defects have been repaired , her Decks and sides well caulked and I have placed her , where the Lively and
Canceaux	PERSON	formerly lay , between
Charles Town	PERSON	and
Boston	LOCATION	.

		It is very likely that in this situation she will be of considerable service .

		They have not yet finished caulking the
Boyne	LOCATION	, but this Ship will in a few days be compleat ; The sudden Departure of these Ships .

		from
England	LOCATION	prevented perhaps , their being as well fitted and stored as they otherwise would have been .

		It is certain they came to me with a very scanty allowance of Stores , and their upper works in a leaky Condition .

		I have endeavoured in the most frugal manner to make up these Deficiencies and equip them for Service ; but the want of Men is another impediment .

		The
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	is already upwards of 160 short , and from the same Causes , vizt Death and Desertion , it is likely this number will be increased .

		I have therefore ordered Captain
-LSB- George -RSB- Montagu of the Fowey	PERSON	at
Virginia	LOCATION	to press for Seamen , if Volunteers can not be had .

		It has now become almost unpardonable for Pilots to take Charge of the
Kings Ships	ORGANIZATION	and Vessels , several have been driven from their Homes and threatened with death for assisting his Majesty 's Fleet .

		I therefore encourage them to come to me , and have at this time several Pilots in pay , more than are immediately necessary , thinking these very usefull people should not all be suffered to abandon the Coast when the King 's Service may very soon require their assistance .

		I endeavour to retain them upon the cheapest Terms I can for the King without regarding the established rules of payment , excepting not to exceed them .

		I hope their Lordships will approve of my bearing some of these persecuted Pilots on this emergency , rather than let them quit the Country , as I think the necessity for this measure can not long exist .

		Their Lordships have been pleased to order me to hire two Schooners for the particular Service of this Harbour , which with the Falcon they imagined would be sufficient for the purpose of guarding it ; I have accordingly hired a Sloop and a Schooner , and caused them to be manned , victualed and stored as their Lordships have directed .

		One of these Vessels at the pressing Intreaty of the Inhabitants -LRB- and the Generals desire -RRB- has been chiefly employed at
Marshfield	LOCATION	, 3 and where , tho ' she is at present in this
Harbour	LOCATION	, I must send her or some other again .

		The other hired Vessel has been to and from
Piscataqua	LOCATION	,
Marblehead	LOCATION	and
Salem	LOCATION	, on business for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, and is now in this Harbour assisting in preventing the unlawful Entry of Vessels .

		4 I have also hired a small Sloop of 25 Tons which I have placed between
Nodles Island	LOCATION	and the Main near
Winnisimmet	LOCATION	Ferry ; through this passage I find much Smuggling has been carried as it is extremely convenient and near to the two Towns .

		The small Sloop now placed there will answer every purpose of a much larger and more expensive Vessel .

		Frequent attempts are every week make to enter this
Harbour	LOCATION	, some in the night , and others upon various pretences of Distress , Ignorance and of bringing provisions imagining that provisions might be brought in without complying with the mode prescribed by the Act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	; and smuggling is carried to such a height , and so systematically followed , that without the utmost Vigilance and care , there is no detecting them to Condemnation : We have however caught several lately .

		The posts are become somewhat insecure , two of my last Letters have been opened at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and a Letter from Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	has been absolutely taken away from a special Messenger ; Other Departments of the Crown have experienced the same treatment .

		If this practice gains ground I shall be obliged to hire some good going small Vesels by way of Advice Boats to carry dispatches to the different Ships when opportunities do not offer by any Vessel of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	; but I do assure their Lordships , that whatever Expedients the necessity of the times obliged me to , no Expences shall be incurred but such as the
Safety of his Majesty 's Squadron	ORGANIZATION	and the good of the Service make absolutely necessary .

		As the
Canceaux	LOCATION	was aground in
Piscataqua River	LOCATION	last January , I have ordered her to
Halifax	LOCATION	to have her Bottom examined and then to proceed on the Survey ; Lieut. -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Mowat	PERSON	is also directed in his way to
Halifax	LOCATION	to put into
Falmouth	LOCATION	to protect a new Ship lately launched there , and another Vessel that has brought her Rigging Sails and Stores from
England	LOCATION	; both these Vessels are threatened with being burnt ; I have therefore ordered Lieut.
Mowat	PERSON	to get them round as soon as possible to
Marblehead	LOCATION	or
Portsmouth	LOCATION	where they can be secured from danger .

		Lieut. -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Graves	PERSON	in the
Diana	PERSON	with a Land Officer and a party of Soldiers in another Sloop , at the desire of the General , are gone to
Penobscot	LOCATION	to bring away certain quantities of Arms and Ammunition in the Fort 5 that they may not fall into the hands of our Adversaries .

		The
Glasgow	LOCATION	is again well repaired and afloat ; we are using every means to get her fitted and ready for Sea .

		I am anxiously expecting the Arrival of the
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	; Their Lordships may depend upon my executing whatever Orders I receive by her with the utmost punctuality .

Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	and of their Committees .

		I wish I could say as much of the People of this Province who are more cool than they were but their Leaders by their Acts and Artifices still keep up that seditious & licentious on all Occasions to oppose Government & even to Acts of Rebellion .

		The late Accots from

New England	LOCATION	Governments and doubtless will to those to the southward to assist them but I hope the madness of the Latter is wearing off and that they will get no encouragement from thence This Province has some times been & now is in the new fangled
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	termed a Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	who seem to have taken the Government into their Hands what they intend to do I ca n't pretend to say but they are certainly much puzzled how to act Fear in some & want of Inclination in others will be a great bar to their coming to Extremities tho their Leaders use every Measure to bring them into the Field .

		I am sorry it is not in my Power to supply you with the number of Arms you Request I have them not to spare in the present Conjuncture of the Service here I may assist you with some Powder but can get no safe Opportunity from this to send it to you I shall order you a supply by way of

THOMAS GOLDTHWAITE	PERSON	TO GENERAL THOMAS GAGE 1 Sir , Fort
Pownall	PERSON	Apr. 16th .

		1775 Yesterday I had the honour of receiving your Excellys letter of the 8th instant with orders to deliver to Lieut -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB- Graves the Artillery & Spare arms belonging to this Fort which I immediately comply 'd with & delivr 'd them agreeable to the inclosed list .

		There are now left for the use of the Fort 26 Arms about half a hundd wt of musquet balls & about 10 lb of powder which is a very small stock .

		It has been usual to send a supply of ammunition every year to the Fort but its now near two years since I have had any , supply & indeed the peaceable state of the Indians has made it less necessary .

		Tho the
Indians	ORGANIZATION	have lately shewn a good deal of discontent at the english settling so near their town ; & however insignificant the
Penobscot Indians	ORGANIZATION	may be tho ' t which I believe dont exceed sixty men able to bear arms ; yet if they are join 'd by the
Canada	LOCATION	's Indians & other strangers who hunt with them upon this river they may if they are so inclined , give this part of the province at least a good deal of trouble .

		I shall be always ready to obey your Excellys commands when I 've the honour of receiving them.ー I am -LSB- & c. -RSB- Tho

		AMICUS JUSTICIAE '' TO THE PRINTER OF THE
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Packet 1 -LSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, April 17 , 1775 -RSB- The following affidavits were taken some time past , and might have been ready to insert in last Paper , but by accident were detained ; however , by giving them a place in next Packet the Public in general will probably receive a satisfaction , as well as AMICUS JUSTICIAE .

		We have , no doubt , generally seen an attempt made in a late number of the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Packet by
Dashwood Bacon	PERSON	and others -LRB- probably confederates , -RRB- in order to exculpate the perpetrators of the atrocious fact -LSB- attack -RSB- committed upon the body of
George Taylor	PERSON	, in his own vessel , in the King 's road , by some of the
Diana	PERSON	's crew , under the command of Captain -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Greaves	PERSON	.

		2 That they should attempt to clear themselves , in the manner they have , is not much to be admired , since it commonly happens that the most daring murderers plead `` Not guilty '' but when those who are called men , are grown so callous as to be insensible of the compunctions of conscience , and hardened as to deny the voice of truth , even in the face of the Sun , it then becomes necessary more methodically to arraign them , and investigate their conduct before the tribunal of the People , that so , if possible , they may be subjected to the punishment and contempt which they justly deserve ; for which purpose the following depositions relative to the aforesaid abuse , are here presented to the world , viz :
Wilmington Borough	ORGANIZATION	, ss .

		Personally appeared before me
John M'Kinley	PERSON	,
Esq	PERSON	; chief burgess of said borough ,
Nathan Wood	PERSON	, who being solemnly affirmed , doth declare and say , that he was lately a passenger on board
George Taylor	PERSON	's shallop , at the time when on her passage from this borough to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, she was brought to by a party belonging to the Kings armed schooner
Diana	PERSON	, Captain
Greaves	PERSON	Commander , that on coming on board the shallop , an officer asked what was on board , and being answered by
Taylor	PERSON	, only rum and limes , and the officer demanding proper papers ,
Taylor	PERSON	immediately produced them , The hatch was then opened and the hogsheads counted and compared , which agreeing with the papers , the officer asked further , whether
Taylor	PERSON	had not something more on board , or in the cabin , and in a very scoffing manner enquired whether he had not some teas ,
Taylor	PERSON	replied , he was welcome to go into the cabin and see himself , assuring him at the same time that nothing was on board besides the rum and limes : then the officer and two sailors went into the cabin and stayed some time , on which
Taylor	PERSON	went to the cabin door and looked in ; the Officer asked what he wanted ,
Taylor	PERSON	replied , I did not know there was any body in the cabin but you ー the officer then got into a violent rage , cursing and swearing in the most dreadful manner , and coming upon deck used many horrid imprecations and threats against
Taylor	PERSON	, that he would kick him over-board , & c. for suspecting the
King	ORGANIZATION	's men , and still vaunting that he was a King 's officer , at the same time striking and wounding
Taylor	PERSON	so that the deck was prodigiously besmeared with his blood .

		ー And this affirmant farther saith , that
Taylor	PERSON	gave not the least provocation , but , on the contrary , both in his words and behavior shewed the greatest respect and submission , and never resisted or attempted to touch the officer .

		The shallop coming a breast the schooner , the Officer told Captain
Graves	PERSON	, who was walking on the quarter-deck of the schooner , that `` this fellow has rum and limes on board '' whereupon the Capt. immediately got into the boat with several sailors , came on board the shallop and without any examination highly approved of the conduct of the officer in beating
Taylor	PERSON	, -LRB- who at that time was leaning bleeding violently in the cockpit -RRB- and said that if he had been on board he would have given him twice as much , and threatened to kick his teeth down his throat , and to take him on board the schooner , and there to tie him up and whip him .

		ー The Capt. then ordered four men into the boat to tow the shallop along side the schooner , which had then drifted a small distance a stern , but findings they could not tow her against the wind and tide , the anchor was ordered out , and the Captain asking for the papers , they were handed to him , and he having examined and found them authentick , ordered
Taylor	PERSON	to go about his business after having been detained nearly an hour and a half .

		ー And further this affirmant saith not .


Nathan Wood	PERSON	.

		Affirmed this 1st day of April , 1775 , before
John McKinly	PERSON	.

		Likewise ,
William Carter	PERSON	,
Mary Johnston	PERSON	, and
Daniel Nicholson	PERSON	, being solemnly sworn on the holy Evangelists of Almight God , do severally depose and say , that they , respectively , were on board
George Taylor	PERSON	's shallop , at the time aforementioned , and were particularly attentive to the transactions aforerelated , and that what
Nathan Wood	PERSON	, the above affirmant , hath declared in his examination , is just and true , and particularly , that
George Taylor	PERSON	gave not the least provocation , but on the contrary , behaved in the most respectful and submissive manner ,
William Carter	PERSON	.


Mary Johnston	PERSON	.


Daniel Nicholson	PERSON	.

		Sworn this 1st day of April , 1775 , before
John McKinley	PERSON	Now , if conduct of this kind is permitted with impunity , let us no longer exclaim against the piratical states of
Barbary	LOCATION	for committing outrages upon the subjects of George the Third , since we see British barbarians , the subjects of
George	PERSON	the Third , under his commission , sanction and authority , commit such audacious outrages upon the persons and property of his subjects .

		From what hath been heretofore offered against the present cause of complaint , some may , perhaps , have been ready to treat it as a fiction , but since the matter is here so amply confirmed , may we not with confidence look to the King , and call aloud upon him , or those who represent him in cases of this nature , strictly to examine into this conduct of his servants , so that justice which is the boasted glory of the English nation , may take place , and that they may thereby , in some measure , redeem the honbur and dignity of the Crown from the obloquy and contempt to which such conduct has too justly subjected it .

Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 18th April 1775 At 8 this night the Commanding Officers of Regiments were sent for to Headquarters , and ordered to have their respective Grenadiers and
Light Infantry Companies	ORGANIZATION	on the beach near the
Magazine Guard	ORGANIZATION	exactly at 10 o'Clock this night , with one day 's provisions in their Havresacks , and without knapsacks ー They were directed to order their Companies to parade quietly at their respective
Barracks	ORGANIZATION	, and to march to the place of Rendezvous in small parties , and if Challenged to answer `` Patrole . ''

		ー The Companies of our Regiment -LRB- the 23rd -RRB- marched ` accordingly , and were the first , complete , at the place of parade ; Here we found a number of the Men of War 's and Transports boats in waiting .

		ー As there was no public Officer attending to superintend the Embarkation , which it was evident would take up a good deal of time , our two Companies with the approbation of the Officers of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, embarked in the nearest boats , and pushed off a little way from the shore .

		As the other Companies arrived soon after , as many men embarked as the boats would contain .

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 1775 April 19th -LSB- The troops -RSB- were attacked ... at
Lexington	LOCATION	by the Provincials .

		The instant this was known , and that the latter returning to
Charles Town	PERSON	, the Admiral ordered all the
Marines on Board	ORGANIZATION	to be ready to land at a Moments Warning upon a Signal for that purpose , and by desire of General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, they were landed in the afternoon at
Charles Town	LOCATION	under the command of Captain Lieut.
James Johnson	PERSON	to cover the retreat of our harrassed Soldiers .

		But it was the
Somerset	LOCATION	alone that preserved the detachment from Ruin .

		The vicinity of that formidable Ship to
Charles Town	LOCATION	so intimidated its Inhabitants that they -LRB- tho ' reluctantly -RRB- suffered the Kings Troops to come in and pass over to
Boston	LOCATION	, who would otherwise have been undoubtedly attacked , and in their defenceless conditions such a proceeding must have been fatal to all the Land Forces on that side , exhausted as they were with Fatigue and without Ammunition ; & the consequence of their destruction might have been that of the rest of the army in
Boston	LOCATION	, for , had the
Charles	PERSON	town people massacred those poor harrassed Soldiers just returned from
Lexington	LOCATION	, there can be no doubt but they would have immediately crossed to
Boston	LOCATION	, where they were certain to find 19 out of 20 willing and ready to assist them in finishing their work .

		At an interview this Evening with General
Gage	PERSON	the Admiral advised the burning of
Charles	PERSON	town and
Roxbury	LOCATION	, and the seizing of the Heights of
Roxbury	LOCATION	and Bunkers Hill , -LRB- indeed the latter had been begun to be fortified , but that work was discontinued for some reasons with which the Admiral was unacquainted -RRB- ; to this Proposal the General objecting the weakness of his
Army	ORGANIZATION	, the Admiral replied that he would strengthen it to the utmost of his power by landing what few Marines remained aboard his Fleet , and , if the
General	ORGANIZATION	would withdraw the 64th Regiment from
Castle William	LOCATION	, he would garrison it with his Seamen and be answerable for its safety .

		Such a plan pursued , at the same time that the three Line of Battle Ships lay opposite to the town full of Rebels and their Goods , would probably have chequed the most daring and have given such an Appearance of activity to our Operations that things might have continued a long time quiet .

		It was indeed the Admirals opinion that we ought to act hostiley from this time forward by burning & laying waste the whole country , & his inclination and intentions were to strain every nerve for the public Service .

		BRITISH ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLES OF
LEXINGTON	LOCATION	AND
CONCORD	ORGANIZATION	1 A circumstantial Account of an attack that happened , on the 19th April , 1775 , on his Majesty 's Troops by a number of the people of the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay ー On Tuesday the 18th of April , about half past 10 at night , Lieutenant Colonel
-LSB- Francis -RSB- Smith	PERSON	of the 10th Regiment embarked from the Common at
Boston	LOCATION	with the Grenadiers and Light Infantry of the troops there , and landed on the opposite side from whence he began his march towards
Concord	LOCATION	where he was ordered to destroy a magazine of military stores ー deposited there for the use of an army to be assembled in order to act against his Majesty & his Government ー The Col : called his officers together and gave orders that the Troops should not fire unless fired upon , and after marching a few miles detached six
Companies of Light Infantry	ORGANIZATION	under the command of Major -LSB-
John -RSB- Pitcairn	PERSON	, to take possession of two bridges on the other side of
Concord	ORGANIZATION	; soon after they heard many signal guns , and the ringing of alarm bells repeatedly which convinced them that the Country was rising to oppose them and that it was a preconcerted scheme to oppose the King 's troops , whenever there should be a favorable opportunity for it .

		About 3 o'Clock the next morning the Troops being advanced , within two miles of
Lexington	LOCATION	, intelligence was received that about 500 men in arms were assembled , and determined to oppose the King 's Troops : and on
Major Pitcairn	ORGANIZATION	's galloping up to the head of the advanced companies , two officers informed him that a man -LRB- advanced from those that were assembled -RRB- had presented his musket , and attempted to shoot them , but the piece flashed in the pan .

		On this the Major gave directions to the troops to move forward , but on no account to fire , nor even to attempt it without orders .

		When they arrived at the end of the village , they observed about 200 armed men drawn up on a green , and when the troops came within one hundred yards of them , they began to file off towards some stone walls on their right flank , the Light Infantry observing this run after them .

		The Major instantly called to the soldiers not to fire but to surround and disarm them .

		Some of them who had jumped over a wall , then fired 4 or 5 Shot at the troops ; wounded a man of the 10th Regiment , and the Majors horse in two places and at the same time several shots were fired from a Meeting-house on the left ー Upon this without any order or regularity the Light Infantry began a scattered fire , and killed several of the country people , but were silenced as soon as the authority of their Officers could make them .

		After this Col :
Smith	PERSON	marched up with the remainder of the detachment , and the whole body proceeded to
Concord	LOCATION	, where they arrived about 9 o'Clock without any thing further happening ; but vast numbers of armed people were seen assembling on all the heights While Col :
Smith	PERSON	with the Grenadiers , and part of the Light Infantry remained at
Concord	ORGANIZATION	to search for Cannon & c. there ; he detached Capt.
Parsons	PERSON	with six Light Companies to secure a bridge at some distance from
Concord	LOCATION	, and to proceed from thence to certain houses where it was supposed there was Cannon and Ammunition .

		Captain
Parsons	PERSON	in pursuance of these orders , posted three companies at the bridge , and on some heights near it under the command of
Capt Laurie	PERSON	of the 43rd Regiment and with the remainder went and destroyed some Cannon-wheels powder and ball ー The people still continued increasing on the heights , and in about an hour after a large body of them began to move towards the bridge ; the Light Companies of the 4th and 10th then descended and joined
Capt Laurie	PERSON	, the people continued to advance in great numbers , and fired upon the King 's troops , killed three men , wounded four officers , one serjeant and four privates ; upon which -LRB- after returning the fire -RRB-
Capt Laurie	PERSON	and his Officers thought it prudent to retreat towards the main body at
Concord	LOCATION	, and were soon joined by two Companies of Grenadiers .

		When
Capt Parsons	PERSON	returned with the three Companies over the bridge they observed three soldiers on the ground , one of them scalped , his head much mangled , and his ears cut off tho ' not quite dead ; a sight which struck the soldiers with horror .


Capt Parsons	PERSON	marched on and joined the main body , who were only waiting for his coming up , to march back to
Boston	LOCATION	ー Colonel
Smith	PERSON	had executed his orders , without opposition by destroying all the military stores he could find .

		Both the Colonel and
Major Pitcairn	ORGANIZATION	having taken all possible pains to convince the inhabitants that no injury was intended them , and that if they opened their doors when required , to search for said stores , not the slightest mischief should be done .

		Neither had any of the people the least occasion to complain ; but they were sulky and one of them even struck Majorr Pitcairn Except
Capt Laurie	PERSON	at the bridge , no hostilities happen 'd from the affair at
Lexington	LOCATION	, until the troops began their march back .

		As soon as the troops had got out of the town of
Concord	LOCATION	they received a heavy fire on them from all sides from walls , fences , houses , trees , barns & c which continued without intermission , till they met the first brigade with two field pieces near
Lexington	LOCATION	ordered out under the command of Lord -LSB-
Hugh -RSB- Percy	PERSON	to support them ; Upon the firing of the field pieces the people 's fire was for a while silenced , but as they still continued to increase greatly in numbers they fired again as before from all places where they could find cover , upon the whole body and continued so doing for the space of fifteen miles ー Notwithstanding their numbers , they did not attack openly during the whole day , but kept under cover on all occasions .

		The troops were very much fatigued , the greater part of them having been under arms all night , and made a march of upwards of forty miles before they arrived at
Charlestown	LOCATION	, from whence they were ferried over to Bostonー The troops had above fifty killed , and many more wounded ; reports are various of the loss sustained by the country-people , some make it very considerable , others not so much .

Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 19th .

		-LSB- April , 1775 -RSB- Last night between 10 and 11 oclock all the Grenadiers and Light Infantry of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	making about 600 Men -LRB- under the command of Lt.
Coll	PERSON	.


Smith	PERSON	of the 10th and Major
Pitcairn	PERSON	of the
Marines	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- embarked , and were landed upon the opposite shore on
Cambridge Marsh	LOCATION	; few but the Commandg .

		Officers knew what expedition we were going upon .

		After getting over the Marsh where we were wet up to the knees , we were halted in a dirty road and stood there 'till two oclock in the morning waiting for provisions to be brought from the boats and to be divided , and which most of the Men threw away , having carried some with 'em .

		At 2 oclock we began our March by wading through a very long ford up to our Middles : after going a few miles we took 3 or 4 People who were going off to give intelligence ; about 5 miles on this side of a
Town	ORGANIZATION	called
Lexington	LOCATION	which lay in our road , ... we waited a considerable time there and at length proceeded on our way to
Concord	LOCATION	, which we then learnt was our destination , in order to destroy a
Magazine of Stores	ORGANIZATION	collected there ... .

		we march 'd into the Town after taking possession of a
Hill	PERSON	with a Liberty Pole on it and a flag flying which was cut down ; the
Yankies	LOCATION	had that
Hill	PERSON	but left it to us ; we expected they wou 'd have made a stand there , but they did not chuse it ... .

		having done the business we were sent upon , We set out upon our return ; before the whole had quitted the Town we were fired on from Houses and behind Trees , and before we had gone 1/2 a mile we were fired on from all sides , but mostly from the Rear , where People had hid themselves in houses 'till we had passed and then fired ; the Country was an amazing strong one , full of
Hills	LOCATION	,
Woods	PERSON	, stone Walls , & c. , which the Rebels did not fail to take advantage of , for they were all lined with People who kept an incessant fire upon us , as we did too upon them but not with the same advantage , for they were so concealed there was hardly any seeing them : in this way we marched between 9 and 10 miles , their numbers increasing from all parts , while ours was reducing by deaths , wounds and fatigue , and we were totally surrounded with such an incessant fire as it 's impossible to conceive , our ammunition was likewise near expended ... .

		When we got to
Menotomy	PERSON	there was a very heavy fire ; after that we took the short cut into the
Charles Town	LOCATION	road , very luckily for us too , for the Rebels thinking we shou 'd endeavour to return by
Cambridge	LOCATION	had broken down the Bridge and had a great number of Men to line the road and ` to receive us there ; however we threw them and went on to
Charles Town	PERSON	without any great interruption .

		We got there between 7 and 8 oclock at night , took possession of the hill above the Town and waited for the Boats to carry us over which came some time after ; the Rebels did not chuse to follow us to the
Hill	PERSON	as theymust have fought us on open ground and that they did not like ... .

		we embarked and got home very late in the night .

		Thus ended this Expedition , which from beginning to end was as ill plan 'd and ill executed as it was possible to be ; had we not idled away three hours on
Cambridge Marsh	ORGANIZATION	waiting for provisions that were not wanted , we shou 'd have had no interruption at
Lexington	LOCATION	, but by our stay the Country People had got intelligence and time to assemble .

		We shou 'd have reached
Concord	LOCATION	soon after day break , before they cou 'd have heard of us , by which we shou 'd have destroyed more
Cannon and Stores	ORGANIZATION	, which they had had time enough to convey away before our arrival ; we might also have got easier back and not been so much harrassed , as they wou 'd not have had time to assemble so many People ; even the People of
Salem	LOCATION	and
Marblehead	LOCATION	above 20 miles off had intelligence and time enough to march and meet us on our return ; they met us somewhere about
Menotomy	PERSON	but they lost a good many for their pains .

		Thus for a few trifling stores the Grenrs .

		and
Lt Infantry	ORGANIZATION	had a march of about 50 Miles -LRB- going and returning -RRB- through an
Enemy	ORGANIZATION	's Country , and in all human probability must every Man have been cut off if the Brigade had not fortunately come to their Assistance ; for when the Brigade joined us there were very few Men had any ammunition left , and so fatigued that we cou 'd not keep flanking parties out , so that we must soon have laid down our Arms , or been picked off by the Rebels at their pleasure ー nearer to ー and we not able to keep 'em off .

Newport	LOCATION	-RSB- Apr. 20 -LSB- 1775 -RSB- At VIII o'Clock this morning an Express arrived in Town from
Providence	LOCATION	, with the following Lettersー Sir Providence April 19th 1775 10 o'Clock at Night Having received Intelligence that our Breth -LSB- ern -RSB- in Mass : Bay are attacked by a body of regular Troops and that many of our Friends are slain .

		ー These are to request your Honor that you will be pleased to call the Genl .

		Assembly of this Colony to meet together as soon as possible -LRB- by Monday next at furthest -RRB- that they may make such necessary preparations for the comon Defence as shall be thot necessary ー We are your Honors Obed .

		P.S. .

		There are two Gentlemen here from the Prov .

		We beg your Honors Answer ー Copyー N.B. .

		The foregoing is directed to Gov.
-LSB- Joseph -RSB- Wanton	PERSON	and is signed by 26 of the principal Inhabitants of
Providence	LOCATION	.

		Sir This Evening Intelligence hath been rec 'd that about Twelve hundred of the Regulars have proceeded from
Boston	LOCATION	towards
Concord	LOCATION	, and having fired upon and killed a number of the Inhabitants of
Lexington	LOCATION	are now actually engaged in butchering and destroying our Brethern there in the most inhuman manner , that the Inhabitants oppose them with zeal and courage and numbers have already fallen on both sides ー Reinforcements were at Ten o'clock under Motion from
Boston	LOCATION	, and the Provincials were alarmed and mustering as fast as possible , it appears necessary therefore that we immediately make some provision for their assistance , and his Honor the Lieutenant General desires your immediate Attendance to advise and order in that behalf .

		His being very ill occasions my writing in his Behalf ー We shall impatiently wait your Arrival , as Numbers are ready and wait only Orders to proceedー The Countrys Friend and Yours S -LSB- tephen -RSB-

Providence	LOCATION	next Saturday .

		Gen.
Potter	PERSON	-LRB- who lives at
Brtistol	LOCATION	-RRB- set off this morning with numbers from
Bristol	LOCATION	and
Warren	PERSON	.

		None have marched from
Newport	LOCATION	to day , tho ' Col.
Dayton	PERSON	tells me this afternoon that there are five hundred armed and ready to march , waiting only the Governors Orders .

		The Tories have , in order to intimidate , circulated thro ' the Town that Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	of the
Rose Man	PERSON	o ' War , insolently says he will fire upon the Town , and lay it in ashes , if any march from hence ー This intimidates some people .

		They are training , exercising and preparing all day ; It is said that the Regulars coming up with about 30 minute men exercising at
Lexington	LOCATION	, ordered them to lay down their arms ー that upon Refusal , the Regulars dastardly fired upon them and killed six ー that the others returned the fire and killed some of the Regulars ー But of this there is no certainty ー Gov.
Hopkins	PERSON	does not inform the basis of his Intelligence ー dont even date his letter ー And it is not known whether the Troops marched to
Lexington	LOCATION	Yesterday Morning , or before .

		It is probable the whole Country is thrown into the same alarm as last September .

		2 The good Lord direct and overrule all for his glory , and the good of his Chosen ー It is happy that the Troops have given the first blow ー the way is open and clear now for the Americans .

		If they will but tarry out of
Boston	LOCATION	a few days , I doubt not the Americans will give a good Account of them .

		But I fear their cowardice has made them instantly return to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		All that I rely upon in this News is that they have marched to
Lexington	LOCATION	, and killed a few men .

		I am not a little apprehensive that it may prove only another false alarm designedly excited by our people to prevent the Troops from marching out of
Boston	LOCATION	into the Countryー 1 .

Preston Boston	PERSON	22d April 1775 Sir , Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Collins	PERSON	in his Majesty 's
Sloop Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	arrived here the 14th .

		in the Evening and Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Linzee	PERSON	in the Falcon the 16th .

		By these Vesselsl have received their Lordships Orders , your Letters , with Duplicates thereof according to the annexed Schedule .

		I am extremely happy in their Lordship 's Approbation of my Conduct and can at present only repeat my Assurances of paying the strictest attention to all their Commands .

		After the Arrival of the two Sloops above mentioned I ordered the Nautilus to get ready for Sea again immediately , intending to send either her or the Swan to
Georgia	LOCATION	, where their Lordships have been pleased to order a Sloop to be stationed in future ; and have appointed the Falcon to lie within Hull point , between it and
Pettick 's Island	LOCATION	, where I have long desired to place a Sloop ; but the March of part of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and their being unexpectedly attacked by the Rebels on the 19th .

		instant has entirely put a stop to my stationing these Vessels as I had intended .

		On the 18th in the Evening all the boats of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	landed the Grenadiers and Light Infantry of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	near the entrance of
Cambridge River	LOCATION	, from whence they marched towards
Concord	LOCATION	; and in the Morning a Brigade followed them round by the way of
Cambridge Bridge	LOCATION	.

		I am concerned to acquaint you that meeting with a considerable body of armed Men an Engagement ensued wherein many were Killed and wounded on our side .

		The Rebels followed the Indian manner of fighting , concealing themselves behind
Hedges	PERSON	and Trees , and skulking in Woods and Houses , where they galled the Soldiers exceedingly ... The Troops returning that Evening to
Charles Town	PERSON	, and every Boat was employed to bring them over to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I can with great truth inform you that the
Somerset	LOCATION	being within a Quarter of a mile of
Charles Town Kept	LOCATION	its Inhabitants in awe and thereby secured to the Troops an unmolested retreat into that Town , and a peaceable Embarkation for
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Accounts of this Battle you may imagine instantly flew to all parts of the Country , and great numbers of their Militia and Minute Men are assembled at
Cambridge	LOCATION	and
Roxbury	LOCATION	and its Neighbourhood .

		They are at this time intrenching themselves at
Roxbury	LOCATION	, and have absolutely prohibited every kind of provision from being brought to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		They are so elated with having destroyed a few of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Troops that they talk of erecting Batteries at different places to destroy the Men of War , of bombarding the Town , and taking
Castle William	PERSON	.

		I have sent to acquaint the Inhabitants of
Charles Town	LOCATION	with my determination to destroy it whenever I perceive them making any preparations for erecting Batteries to annoy the Kings Ships , which I shall most certainly do the moment I perceive them fairly at Work .

		Last Night the Rebels were reconnoitring Castle William in Canoes , and upon being challenged fired at the Centinels .

		They escaped by the darkness of the Night , but today the
Asia	LOCATION	and Hope Schooner are so placed that every Attempt upon the Castle must be fatal to them .

		The Falcon is in
Gallows Creek	LOCATION	.

		The Nautilus at the N.W. End of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Every Sail is kept in Town , and the utmost precautions are taken for the general Safety ... Their Lordships may depend on my heartily co-operating with the General and on my giving him every assistance in my power in support of such measures as shall be thought best for his
Majesty 's Service	ORGANIZATION	.

Williamsburg	LOCATION	, April 22 .

		Last Thursday night -LSB- April 20 -RSB- Capt. -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Collins	PERSON	, with a party of men , belonging to the
Magdalen	ORGANIZATION	armed scooner , by command of Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, came to this city , from
Burwell	PERSON	's ferry , and privately removed out of the magazine , and carried on board the said schooner , about 20 barrels of gunpowder belonging to this colony .

		The inhabitants were alarmed with the intelligence early yesterday morning , the
Common Hall	LOCATION	assembled , and the following address was presented to the Governor .

		To his Excellency the Right Hon.
John Earl of Dunmore	PERSON	, his Majesty 's Lieutenant , Governor General , and Commander in Chief of the colony and dominion of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		The humble Address of the Mayor , Recorder , Aldermen , and
Common Council	ORGANIZATION	of the city of
Williamsburg	LOCATION	.


My Lord	PERSON	, We his Majesty 's dutiful and loyal subjects , the Mayor , Recorder , Aldermen , and
Common Council	ORGANIZATION	, of the city of
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, in
Common Hall	LOCATION	assembled , humbly beg leave to represent to your Excellency , that the inhabitants of this city were this morning exceedingly alarmed by a report that a large quantity of gunpowder was in the preceding night , while they were sleeping in their beds , removed from the public magazine in this city , and conveyed , under an escort of marines , on board one of his Majesty 's armed vessels lying at a ferry on
James river	LOCATION	.

		We beg leave to represent to your Excellency , that as this magazine was erected at the public expence of this colony , and appropriated to the safe keeping of such munitions as should be there lodged from time to time , for the protection and security of the country , by arming thereout such of the militia as might be necessary in case of invasion and insurrections , they humbly conceive it to be the only proper repository to be resorted to in times of imminent danger .

		We further beg leave to inform your Excellency , that , from various reports at present prevailing , in different parts of the country , we have too much reason to believe that some wicked and designing persons have instilled the most diabolical notions into the minds of our slaves , and that therefore the utmost attention to our internal security is become the more necessary .

		The circumstances of this city , my Lord , we consider as peculiar and critical .

		The inhabitants , from the situation of the magazine , in the midst of the city , have , for a long tract of time , been exposed to all those dangers which have happened in many countries from explosions and other accidents .

		They have , from time to time thought it incumbent on them to guard the magazine .

		For their security they have , for some time past , judged it necessary to keep strong patrols on foot ; in their present circumstance , they , to have the chief and necessary means of their defense removed , can not but be extremely alarmed .

		Considering ourselves as guardians of the city we therefore humbly desire to be informed by your Excellency , upon what motives , and for what particular purpose , the powder has been carried off in such a manner ; and we earnestly request your Excellency to order it to be immediately returned to the magazine .

		To which his Excellency returned this verbal answer : That , hearing of an insurrection in a neighbouring county , 1 he had removed the powder from the magazine , where he did not think it secure , to a place of perfect security ; and that upon his word and honour , whenever it was wanted in any insurrection , it should be delivered in half an hour ; that he had removed it in the night time to prevent any alarm , and that Captain
Collins	PERSON	had his express commands for the part he had acted ; he was surprised to hear the people were under arms on this occasion , and that he should not think it prudent to put powder into their hands in such a situation .


HENRY LAURENS	PERSON	TO
JOHN LAURENS	PERSON	,
LONDON	LOCATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Charles Town So Carolina	LOCATION	22nd April 1775 p Swallow Packet the people of this province are so alarmed by Lord North 's conciliatory plan which they conceive is intended more effectually to enslave them , that they are , from the example of General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	when he Seized Arms & Amunition which were private property , taking Such measures as `` prudence & necessity '' dictate ー they have removed all the provincial Muskets Bayonets & c. which belong indeed to them Selves , from the public Armory to places more accessible to themselves & they have also taken into their possession all the Gun powder which was in the public Magazines Besides .

		I Say they , from common report , as well as from probability ー they do not Stop here , but are concerting measures for enlarging their
Stock of Arms & Amunition &	ORGANIZATION	probably will not fail ー a poor figure Some people think the
Carolina Militia	ORGANIZATION	would make in the field ー I hope they will never appear there in opposition to British Troops ー I hope British Troops will never provoke them to fly to the last resource ー be that as it may ー there appears a general determination against a tame Submission ー & the -LSB- y -RSB- Will , will in the worst event by arms , remain unconquered ー yet I think I can answer at the hazard of my fortune & Life that not a Man in this province wishes for independence upon
Great Britain	LOCATION	or but wishes to return to , & remain in that State of dependence & Subordination which had for more than a Century been found to promote the honour & dignity of the Mother Country ー the Interest & happiness of both parties ー Your Administration have been egregiously imposed upon by false information & they Seem now though Sensible of their errors , determined to persevere in them ー Let them go on & work the destruction of the
Kingdom	LOCATION	in which they reside ー God forbid !

		ー I have Still hopes that Wisdom will interpose & Save them .

		Sir From undoubted Authority we receiv 'd here this day Morning ー the very disagreeable Intelligence that in the Night of Thursday last Capt -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Collins Commander of one of his Majesty	PERSON	's Sloops of War by ー Command of his Excellency the Governor assisted by a Company of Marines carried off all the powder from the Magazine in the
City of Williamsburg &	ORGANIZATION	deposited it on board his Vessell which lay at
Burwell	PERSON	's fferry , about five miles below the City .

		The said
Authority	ORGANIZATION	informs us that the Corporn of the City of
Wms	ORGANIZATION	burg addressed the Govr on that occasion The people had received no Satisfaction nor are they likely to recover the powder tho ' it is so very necessary for the security of the Country .

		This being a day of Meeting the independt Co of this Town , they considered it necessary , to take the Matter into serious Considn and are come to an unanimous Resolution that a Submission to so arbitrary an Exertion of Government may not only prejudice the common Cause by introducing a suspicion of a defection of this Colony from the noble pursuit but will encourage the tools of despotism to commit further Acts of Violence in this Colony and more especially subject the Arms in the Magazine to the same fate of the powder .

		In these sentiments this Compy could but determine that a Number of public spirited Gentn should embrace this opporty of showing their Zeal in the grand Cause by marching to ー Wmsbg to enquire into this Affair and there to take such steps as may best answer the purpose of recovering the powder & securing the Arms now in the Magazine to this End they have determined to hold themselves in readiness to march from this place as light horse on Saturday Morning and in the mean time -LSB- su -RSB- bmit the Matter to the determn of yours & the neighbouring Counties whom Expresses are purposely forwarded We address you in the -LSB- na -RSB- me of our Co as their Officers & are Sir yr very hble

RICHARD HENRY	PERSON	LEE TO COLONEL
LANDON CARTER	PERSON	1 Dear Sir ,
Chantilly	LOCATION	24th April 1775 We had heard of the Lords 2 flight before your letter came , and we apprehend it to be for fear of reprisal , as we suppose one part of the Ministerial plan has been already executed in
Boston	LOCATION	by seizing the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	proportion of the proscribed Americans , of which there are 32 .

		Some Virginians are in the black list .

		Manuscript intelligence from
London	LOCATION	10 Feby from our most vigilant sensible well informed friends , put the determined hostility of
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	beyond doubt They have to a Man both publickly & privately , solemnly avowed it .

		The notorious practice of this profligate Administration being to deceive with lies and flattering appearances in the very moment of determined vengeance would render belief in any thing they say or do , sottish in the extreme .

		When they offer any thing favorable , a wise American should say with the cautious Trojan ''
Timeo Donais	PERSON	et dona ferentes '' ー Unluckily for the
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	news , that
Greenwood	PERSON	who conveys it , is a Ministerial Agent , and his name is here among those Villains who were Securities for the safety of the Ministerial Tea sent to
S. Carolina	LOCATION	.

		You may be assured Sir that the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	and all their Agents will lie , deceive , and blind by all manner of means ; well knowing they have no chance for success but by such infamous ways , and by putting their Adversaries off their Guard .

		We propose sending a Pilot boat immediately for Gun Powder and she can bring the
Richmond	LOCATION	quantity if their Cash is quickly collected ー But of this no mention should be made but to the most trusty and secret Gentlemen for fear that some Capt.
Collins	PERSON	may be waiting to intercept it .

		3 You may be assured that the plan of
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	is fixed to Compel immediate submission by force of Arms , well knowing that if our
Association	ORGANIZATION	has time to work , that their ruin is infallible .

		God put it into the hands of better men and better times , which will surely be the case if we provide ourselves immediately with
Arms & Ammunition	ORGANIZATION	, learn the discipline , behave like Men and stick close , religiously close to the
Association	ORGANIZATION	.

ESSEX GAZETTE	LOCATION	, TUESDAY , APRIL 18 TO 25 , 1775
Salem	LOCATION	, April 25 .

		Last Wednesday , the 19th of April , the Troops of His Britannick Majesty commenced Hostilities upon the People of this Province , attended with Circumstances of Cruelty not less brutal than what our venerable Ancestors received from the vilest Savages of the Wilderness .

		The Particulars relative to this interesting Event , by which we are involved in all the Horrors of a civil War , we have endeavoured to collect as well as the present confused State of Affairs will admit .

		On Tuesday Evening a Detachment from the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, consisting , it is said , of 8 or 900 Men , commanded by Lieut. Col.
-LSB- Francis -RSB- Smith	PERSON	, embarked at the Bottom of the Common in
Boston	LOCATION	, on board a Number of Boats , and landed at
Phips	ORGANIZATION	's Farm , a little Way up
Charles River	LOCATION	, from whence they proceeded with Silence and Expedition , on their Way to
Concord	LOCATION	, about 18 Miles from
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The People were soon alarmed , and began to assemble , in several Towns , before Day-Light , in order to watch the Motion of the Troops .

		At
Lexington	LOCATION	, 6
Miles	PERSON	below
Concord , a Company of Militia	ORGANIZATION	, of about 100 Men , mustered near the
Meeting House	ORGANIZATION	; the Troops came in Sight of them just before Sun-rise ; and running within a few Rods of them , the Commanding Officer accosted the Militia in Words to this effect : -- `` Disperse you Rebels ー Damn you , throw down your Arms and disperse : '' Upon which the Troops huzza 'd , and immediately one or two Officers discharged their Pistols , which were instantaneously followed by the Firing of 4 or 5 of the Soldiers , and then there seemed to be a general Discharge from the whole Body .

		Eight of our Men were killed , and nine wounded .

		In a few Minutes after this Action the Enemy renewed their March for
Concord	ORGANIZATION	; at which Place they destroyed several Carriages , Carriage Wheels , and about 20 Barrels of Flour , all belonging to the Province .

		Here about 150 Men going towards a Bridge , of which the Enemy were in Possession , the latter fired , and killed 2 of our Men , who then returned the Fire , and obliged the Enemy to retreat back to
Lexington	LOCATION	, where they met Lord -LSB-
Hugh -RSB- Percy	PERSON	, with a large Reinforcement , with two Pieces of Cannon .

		The Enemy now having a Body of about 1800 Men , made a Halt , picked up many of their Dead , and took Care of their Wounded .

		At
Menotomy	LOCATION	, a few of our Men attacked a Party of twelve of the Enemy , -LRB- carrying Stores and Provisions to the Troops -RRB- killed one of them , wounded several , made the Rest Prisoners , and took Possession of all their Arms ,
Stores	ORGANIZATION	, Provisions , & c. without any Loss on our Side .

		ー The Enemy having halted one or two Hours at
Lexington	LOCATION	, found it necessary to make a second Retreat , carrying with them many of their Dead and Wounded , who they put into Chaises and on Horses that they found standing in the
Road	LOCATION	.

		They continued their Retreat from
Lexington	LOCATION	to
Charlestown	LOCATION	with great Precipitation ; and notwithstanding their Field Pieces , our People continued the Pursuit , firing at them till they got to
Charlestown	LOCATION	N eek , -LRB- which they reached a little after Sunset -RRB- over which the Enemy passed , proceeded up Bunker 's
Hill	PERSON	, and soon afterwards went into the Town , under the Protection of the Somerset Man of War of 64 Guns .

		In
Lexington	LOCATION	the Enemy set Fire to Deacon
Joseph Loring	PERSON	's
House	ORGANIZATION	and
Barn	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Mulliken	PERSON	's
House	ORGANIZATION	and Shop , and Mr.
Joshua Bond	PERSON	's
House	ORGANIZATION	and Shop , which were all consumed .

		They also set Fire to several other Houses , but our People extinguished the Flames .

		They pillaged almost every
House	ORGANIZATION	they passed by , breaking and destroying Doors , Windows , Glasses , & c. and carrying off Cloathing and other valuable Effects .

		It appeared to be their Design to burn and destroy all before them ; and nothing but our vigorous Pursuit prevented their infernal Purposes from being put in Execution .

		But the savage Barbarity exercised upon the.Bodies of our unfortunate Brethern who fell , is almost incredible : Not content with shooting down the unarmed , aged and infirm , they disregarded the Cries of the wounded , killing them without Mercy , and mangling their Bodies in the most shocking Manner .

		We have the Pleasure to say , that , notwithstanding the highest Provocations given by the Enemy , not one instance of Cruelty , that we have heard of , was committed by our victorious Militia ; but , listening to the merciful Dictates of the Christian Religion , they `` breathed higher Sentiments of Humanity . ''

		The Consternation of the
People of Charlestown	ORGANIZATION	, when our Enemies were entering the Town , is inexpressible ; the Troops however behaved tolerably civil .

		and the People have since nearly all left the Town .

Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	27 April 1775 Sir I have received your Letters April 22d and 24th The Vessels laden with Provisions and
Naval Stores	ORGANIZATION	I could wish might come to
Boston	LOCATION	, but in doing this we must not -LRB- I find -RRB- use Compulsion , but endeavour -LRB- by making it their Interest -RRB- to entice them to supply us .

		I therefore desire that you will make it publick , that all Vessels who shall bring to
Boston	LOCATION	for sale live
Cattle	ORGANIZATION	, Sheep , Hogs , Poultry , Pulse , Fruit , Grain , Flour , Oats , Hay , Vegetables , & other Necessaries of Life , shall have my Protection and be at
Liberty	ORGANIZATION	to depart with their Vessels and Crew , whenever they have disposed of their Cargoes , and finding that detaining New England Property is not likely to answer our intended purpose , you may allow all Vessels to pass as you please .

		I have no objection to the Friends of Government and Women and Children removing where they like from any apprehended Danger , and therefore approve of what you have done on that head .

		The Fishing Vessels may also continue to navigate as usual and depart with their Merchantable Fish to Market , as I can not at present authorize the detention either of their Persons or Effects .

STEPHEN HOPKINS	PERSON	TO PRESIDENT OF THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS OF MASSACHUSETTS 1 Sir ,
Providence	LOCATION	April 27 .

		1775 .

		Yesterday Mr.
John Brown	PERSON	, one of the principal Merchants of this Town , being at
Newport	LOCATION	, as an Agent for this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, appointed by the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	to purchase Provisions , for the Use of this and your Government , was seized upon in a Freight or Packet Boat coming to
Providence	LOCATION	.

		He was carried and confined on Board a Man of War lying in
Newport	LOCATION	; and about 300 Barrels of Flour , in that Packet and another Freight Vessel , taken by the Ship of War .

		It is said the Captures are to be sent to
Boston	LOCATION	for Condemnation ー We are greatly alarmed at this open Force and Hostility ; and can not but expect that the worst of Treatment will be offered to our Agent .

		We have thought Proper to send you this Notice , to the End that you may detain all such of the King 's Officers , or others in his immediate Service , as may be in your Hands , to answer and be accountable for the Conduct and Treatment , which may be had and acted to Mr
Brown	PERSON	, and such as may be captured with him in the said two Vessels ; and that you would on your Part in the common Cause do your utmost to make Reprisals of Persons to stand as Security in like Manner , not doubting but you will chearfully do those Things , which by the Laws of Nature and Nations are justifiable to be done to those , who put themselves in a State of War with others .

		We are sorry to inform you that the first Struggle , which hath happened in our Colony , hath been unfavorable ; an Event which could not have come to pass , but by the Faithlessness of some of the Members of our Assembly , who must have revealed their Proceedings , although the Oath of GOD was upon them to Secrecy .

		Reprisal , recommended by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and sanctified by the several Colonies , appears to be a good remedial Provision , and in this Instance highly necessary to be put in Practice ; and we shall not fail ourselves to make Use of it at every Opportunity , and make the Life of every Crown Officer in our Power Security for the Safety of
John Brown	PERSON	and those captured with him .

		I am , Sir , for myself and in Behalf of all the true Friends of Freedom in this Colony -LSB- & c. -RSB- Step

Wallis	PERSON	detained
Mr Brown	PERSON	on board His Majesty 's Ship Swan , and contrary to my Request for liis dismission has sent him round to
Boston	LOCATION	, to the very great Distress of his Family and numerous Connexions ー The Pretext Capt Wallis may have for so extraordinary a Proceeding , I am not acquainted with as he has not answered the letter I wrote him in behalf of Mr
Brown	PERSON	; nor given me the least Information in that Matter , which renders it necessary I shou 'd address your Excellency in behalf of this unfortunate injured Gentleman , and to assure you , that he is a Person of considerable Fortune , One of the largest Traders in the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and universally esteemed ; his detention , Sir , will also be attended with the most ruinous Consequences to his Business , he being Owner of a large Number of Vessels , many of which are hourly expected from different Voyages ; Considering these Circumstances and the peculiarly hard fate of Mr.
Brown	PERSON	, in being forced out of his Business , and sent such a Distance from Home , I hope your Excellency will excuse me , when I intreat you to exert your Influence in this Affair , that Mr
Brown	PERSON	may , without too great loss of
Time	ORGANIZATION	, be restored to his Family and Business ー I have the Honor to be , with great Respect Your Excellency 's -LSB- & c. -RSB-

PEYTON RANDOLPH	PERSON	, FOR THE CORPORATION OF

LEWIS WILLIS	PERSON	AND
BENJAMIN GRYMES	LOCATION	, JR. 1 Gentlemen
Williamsburg	LOCATION	the 27th April 1775 In compliance with your request we give you a candid Relation of the Disturbance which happend last Week in this City about the removal of the Powder from the
Public Magazine	ORGANIZATION	.

		Early on Friday morning -LSB- April 21 -RSB- the Inhabitants were universally and much alarmed at the Report that the Powder had been removed the preceding Night under an Escort of Marines and carried on board an Armed Vessel at
Burwell	ORGANIZATION	's Ferry .

		The Common Hall assembled and presented the address which we presume you have seen with the Governors Answer .

		The Inhabitants were so much exasperated that they flew to their Arms ; This incensed the Governor a good deal and from every thing we can learn was the principal Reason why his Answer was not more explicit and favourable .

		His Excellency has repeatedly assured several Respectable Gentlemen that his only motive in Removing the Powder was to secure it , as there had been an alarm from the County of
Surry	LOCATION	which at first seem 'd too well founded , tho it afterwards proved Groundless ; besides what he has said in his Public Answer , he has given private assurances to Several Gentlemen , that the Powder shall be Return 'd to the Magazine , tho he has not condescended to fix the Day for its Return .

		So far as we can Judge from a Comparison of all Circumstances , The Governor considers his Honor as at Stake ; he thinks that he acts for the best and will not be compell 'd to what we have abundant Reason to believe he would Cheerfully do , were he left to himself ー Frequent Messages have been sent from the Neighbouring Counties to enquire into the State of this unfortunate affair with the most friendly and Spirited offers of assistance and Protection .

		The City could not but hold themselves exceedingly obliged to those Gentlemen as they do to you Gentlemen , and the rest of our Worthy Country Men , by whom we understand you are sent , We hope that you and the other Gentlemen can have no doubt of our paying the utmost attention to the
Country 's Interest	ORGANIZATION	as well as our own Security in particular .

		If We then may be permitted to advise , it is our opinion and most earnest request that Matters may be quieted for the present at least ; we are firmly persuaded that perfect Tranquility will be Speedily Restored ; by pursuing this Course we foresee no Hazard or even inconvenience that can ensue ; whereas we are apprehensive , and this we think upon good Grounds that violent measures may produce effects , which God only knows the consequence of .

		We beg that our thanks and best Wishes may be presented to the several Gentlemen of this Country who have interested themselves in our Behalf and are Gen : -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		CIRCULAR LETTER FROM THE
GENERAL COMMITTEE OF SOUTH CAROLINA	ORGANIZATION	TO THE COMMITTEES IN THE SEVERAL DISTRICTS AND PARISHES OF THE PROVINCE 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Charlestown	LOCATION	, April 27 , 1775 Gentlemen , The
General Committee	ORGANIZATION	thinking it of the highest Importance that the Committees in the interior Parts of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and that , through them , the People at large , should from
Time	ORGANIZATION	to Time be informed of all such Affairs and Transactions as have any Relation to the American Cause ; they have for the Management of so necessary a
Service	ORGANIZATION	nominated a
Committee of Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are very sorry that at our entering upon that Service we are to announce to you that there is but little Probability of deciding the present unhappy Public Disputes , by the pacific Measures we have hitherto pursued .

		However , even this Circumstance , we hope , will be of Service to our Cause ; for we have no Doubt , but that the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	having thus turned a deaf Ear to the Complaints of the Colonies , these will be confirmed in their Resolution to complain in a louder Tone , and be ANIMATED to meet those Difficulties and Dangers they can now no longer avoid , with Honour to themselves , and Safety to their Liberties .

		On the 9th of February the two Houses of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	addressed the King .

		In Substance , they declared to His Majesty that
America	LOCATION	was in a State of actual Rebellion ; they desired the King , by all possible Means , to enforce the late Acts of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	against
America	LOCATION	; and they assured him that in such a Measure they would support him with their Lives and Fortunes .

		The King acquiesced , and some Days after desired from
Parliament an Addition	ORGANIZATION	to his military Forces ー it was granted without Hesitation .

		In consequence of these Measures , Reinforcements of Troops and Ships are ordered to
Boston	LOCATION	; where , when they shall be arrived , General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	may have under his Command about 10,000 Men .

		But what are 10,000 Men against THE
UNITED POWERS OF AMERICA	ORGANIZATION	!

		Amidst this Gloom , some Rays of Light break in , and cheer us in this Extremity of Affairs .

		The City of
London	LOCATION	has declared in our Favour ; in a few Hours , some of her Mercants subscribed 26,000 l. Sterling for the
Relief of America	ORGANIZATION	, and public Subscriptions for the same Purpose are industriously promoted .


London	LOCATION	, and other considerable Towns , have petitioned
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and continue to exert themselves vigorously in our Behalf .

		The most illustrious Noblemen , and the most eloquent Orators , are loud in our Defence .

		CIRCULAR LETTER FROM THE
GENERAL COMMITTEE OF SOUTH CAROLINA	ORGANIZATION	TO THE COMMITTEES IN THE SEVERAL DISTRICTS AND PARISHES OF THE PROVINCE 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Charlestown	LOCATION	, April 27 , 1775 On the 8th of March
Bill	PERSON	passed the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, restraining the Provinces of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, from fishing on the Banks of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	; and from exporting to any Part of the World , but to '' Great-Britain , or some of the
British Islands	LOCATION	in the
West Indies	LOCATION	. ''

		Thus , as these four Provinces have by the
American Association	ORGANIZATION	contracted not to export to those Places , THEIR EXPORTS ARE TOTALLY STOPPED .

		And the Act further says , that into those Provinces shall NOT be imported any `` Sort of Wines , Salt , or any Goods or Commodities whatsoever -LRB- except Horses ,
Victual	PERSON	, and Linen Cloth , the Produce and Manfacture of
Ireland	LOCATION	, and Goods for the victualling of his Majesty 's Ships , and for his Majesty 's Forces and Garrisons , or the Produce of the
British Islands	LOCATION	in the
West Indies	LOCATION	-RRB- upon any Pretence whatsoever , unless such Goods be shipped in
Great-Britain	LOCATION	, and carried directly from thence . ''

		Thus , as those Provinces are bound by the
Association	ORGANIZATION	not to import FROM
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, or the
West Indies	LOCATION	, it is evident that their IMPORTATION in the Way of Trade is TOTALLY PREVENTED .

		If the Blockade of
Boston	LOCATION	alone ROUSED the whole Continent to their Rescue and Support , HOW VIGOROUSLY ought we to exert ourselves , NOW that four entire Provinces are blockaded by an Act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and CUT OFF FROM ALL MANNER OF TRADE !

		And , Gentlemen , remember , this violent Measure has been executed SINCE the Introduction of Lord North 's conciliatory Motion .

		This arbitrary Conduct on the other Side of the Water has driven the People of this Capital , and the neighbouring Country , TO DESPAIR of a Redress of American Grievances , without an EFFUSION of AMERICAN BLOOD ー OF THIS they are virtuously willing to contribute their Quota , and even more than their Proportion , to procure this invaluable Relief .

		These Advices arrived on the 14th and 19th Days of this Month ; and on the Night of the 21st Inst .

		the Public Armory and Magazines were opened , and a considerable Quantity of Arms and Ammunition were taken , without Doubt , for the Ends for which they were originally procured ー THE PUBLIC SAFETY .

		Last Wednesday , the 26th Instant , the
General Committee	ORGANIZATION	passed a Vote , that the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	be summoned to meet in
Charlestown	LOCATION	on Tuesday the 20th Day of June .

		We make no Doubt but that you will exert yourselves to give a general Notification of it , that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	may be as full as possible , as it is expected Affairs of the HIGHEST Importance will be the Subject of Deliberation .

Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, which in their apprehension were unconstitutional and oppressive should have given the good people of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, a very just and general alarm .

		Your subsequent proceedings in fortifying the town of
Boston	LOCATION	& other military preparations greatly encreased their apprehensions for the safety of their friends and brethern ー They could not be unconcerned spectators of their sufferings in that which they esteemed the common cause of this country , but the late hostile and secret inroads of some of the troops under your command into the heart of the country and the violences they have committed , have driven them almost into a state of desperation ー They feel now , not only for their friends , but for themselves and their dearest interests and connections ー We wish not to exaggerate ; we are not sure of every part of our information , but by the best intelligence that we have yet been able to obtain the late transaction was a most unprovoked attack upon the lives and property of His Majesty 's subjects , and it is represented to us , that such outrages have been committed as would be a disgrace even to barbarians ; much more to Britons , so highly famed for humanity as well as bravery ー It is feared therefore that we are devoted to destruction and that you have it in command and intention to ravage and desolate the country ー If this is not the case , permit us to ask why have these outrages been committed ?

		Why is the town of
Boston	LOCATION	now shut up & to what end are all these hostile preparations that are daily making & why do we continually hear of fresh destinations of troops for this country ?

		The people of this Colony , you may rely upon it abhor the idea of taking arms against the troops of their sovereign and dread nothing so much as the horrors of civil war ; but at the same time we beg leave to assure your Excellency that as they apprehend themselves justified by the principle of selfdefence they are most firmly resolved to defend their rights and privileges to the last extremity ; nor will they be restrained from giving aid to their brethem if any unjustifiable attack is made upon them ー Be so good therefore as to explain yourself upon this most important subject as far as it is consistent with your duty to our common Sovereign ー Is there no way to prevent this unhappy dispute from coming to extremeties ?

		Is there no alternative but absolute submission or the desolations of War ?

		By that humanity which constitutes so aimable a part of your character as well as for the honour of your Sovereign and by the Glory of the British Empire we entreat you will prevent it if it be possible ー Surely it is to be hoped that the temperate wisdom of the Empire might even yet find expedients to restore peace , that so all parts of the Empire may enjoy their particular rights honours and immunities .

		Certainly it is an event most devoutly to be wished for And will it not be consistent with your duty to suspend the operations of war on your part , and enable us on ours to quiet the minds of the people at least until the result of some further deliberations may be known ?

		The importance of the occasion will we doubt not sufficiently apologize for the earnestness with which we address you , and any seeming impropriety which may attend it , as well as induce you to give us the most explicit and favourable answer in your powerー I am with great esteem and respect in behalf of the
Genl Assembly Sir	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- & c. -RSB- 2 1 .

America	LOCATION	and we have Reason to Expect the Troops booth from
England & Boston	ORGANIZATION	will make their head Quarters here & many are Sending out their families & Packing up their goods to Send them off ー yesterday a very great Number of People -LRB- some suppose about 300 with arms -RRB- met in the Common from whence they Proceeded to our Collector about two Miles out of

United	ORGANIZATION	than any Province , a
Provintial Congress	ORGANIZATION	is Called to Meet here the 22d of Next Month , as also in

		ROBERT EDEN , GOVERNOR OF
MARYLAND	LOCATION	, TO HIS BROTHER WILLIAM EDEN 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Annapolis	LOCATION	, 28th April 1775 .

		You must not be angry with me for -LRB- at this Time -RRB- being apparently negligent in my Intelligence to
Lord Dartmouth	LOCATION	, for it is impossible to give any positive Intelligence or Information on Affairs here .

		We are at this Time , as You will judge by the inclosed , in a State of thorough Confusion .

		I had set apart Wednesday , Yesterday , and this Day -LRB- Friday -RRB- for writing fully on the Affairs of this Country , which I would not do sooner , from some well grounded Hopes I had of seeing a total Change here , on what I remarked , at our receiving the Intelligence of your preparing the Armament against
America	LOCATION	; which , if it did not immediately cause an Alteration among the Sentiments , did in the Avowals of our staunchest Patriots , and gave me great Room to hope we should return into a Channel of regular Submission to the Laws of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		When lo !

		on Wednesday at 1 P. M , the inclosed No 1 appeared .

		2 ー I openly disavowed every Probability of Truth in the Account ; but the Alarm you may easily conceive not to be small here .

		In the Afternoon I was waited on by six Gentlemen of respectable Characters , requesting me , that as , in Consequence of this News , they were under great Apprenhensions of some Attempt being made by the Servants or Slaves for their Liberty , they hoped I would commit the Custody of the Arms and Ammunition to the Freemen of the Country , for that otherwise they would not answer for Consequences from an Insurrection .

		I expostulated with them , advised them ー and tried to convince them they were only going to accelerate the Evil they dreaded from their Servants and Slaves ー In vain , however , altho ' I agreed , by the Advice of the Council , to commit the Care of the Arms to the Custody of such Gentlemen of the Militia -LRB- regularly appointed by myself -RRB- as they must place Confidence in .

		They expressed great Satisfaction with this ; but the next Day -LRB- Yesterday -RRB- applied to me , under the Militia Act of this Province , for Arms , for the Purposes abovementioned .

		ー and , by Advice of the Council , then sitting at my
House	ORGANIZATION	, I agreed to furnish four Counties -LRB- whose Colonels made a regular Application -RRB- with Arms & c. , such as they are ; and perhaps each County -LRB- of those four -RRB- will get 100 Stand , which their Colonels give Receipts for , and are to share with the Counties that have not had Time to apply .

		I thought this a better Mode of proceeding , than refusing , as the Event shews : For , altho ' last Night , they took away the Powder -LRB- which has been here 20 years , and is useless -RRB- except five Barrels of mine in the Magazine , they were last Night , and this Morning , prohibited by Capt.
Hyde	PERSON	's Company , belonging to this City , from taking the Arms ; who , to shew the Strangeness of our Conduct , had , on Wednesday , paraded to assist them in taking them away should I have refused to grant them ; a Dilemma this , that puzzled them !

		And
Hyde	PERSON	's Company have so far succeeded -LRB- the others cool and unconcerned Spectators , in
Scarlet	LOCATION	, lined with
Buff	PERSON	-RRB- as to claim , and take , this Afternoon , their proportion of the Arms & c except Powder .

		This must , I suppose , mortify the Convention , some of whom think that I have engaged to support that Company with the Friends I can rely on , and with whom I defeated some former Combinations .

		You need be under no Uneasiness about me : I am well supported , and not obnoxious to any unless it be to some of our infernal Independents , who are in League with the Bostonians .

		Writing in such a Hurry , and so straitened for Time , I forgot to say that , about ten this Morning , No 2 , or rather the Original of it , came to Town ; but I can not , -LRB- tho ' alarmed on hearing it with many added Circumstances -RRB- gave Credit to it .

		It comes thro ' an independent Channel , and I rather think it intended to draw in the other Colonies , that they may share in the Punishment of the Bostonians , or , by being entitled to it , mitigate it .

		In this Province , there are very many , I really believe a Majority of Friends to Government ; and we have talked
American Treason	ORGANIZATION	openly in this Town for some Time .

		I will write more fully by a safe Conveyance , the
Sophia	LOCATION	, on Monday or Tuesday : You must see I have no Time now .

		I hourly expect an Uproar of some Sort or another , but am calm enough , considering I am not endowed with Patience .

		I will just add , on behalf of the Gentlemen from the several Counties , who instructed the others in the Application made to me , that their Behaviour was exceedingly respectful , much more so than I expected considering the
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	from the Northward they had received and credited .

		I must trust to You for making proper Excuses to
Lord Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	for my not writing .

		I could not do it , without detaining the Mail , which would give an Alarm , enough of which we have already .

		You will please to communicate all , or as much of this as is necessary , with proper Apologies .

		His Majesty has not a Governor on this Continent , who would more freely expose both his Fortune and his Life in His Service than I would .

		That is well known here , and contributes not a little to keep the dissolute in order : and I have a few faithful and resolute Adherents , whom I can trust to on an Emergency .

		You will probably hear fully from me by
Richardson	PERSON	's Ship , before You get this : ー I will then write to
Lord Dartmouth	LOCATION	.

		Please to present my most respectful Compliments to His Lordship .

		You will have heard of Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	's having removed the Powder from
Williamsburg	LOCATION	.

		We have no King 's Ship here , should I have thought such a step to be expedient , had our Powder been worth removing .

		I hear the
Northern Neck Militia	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Lord
Fairfax	LOCATION	's -RRB- are on their March , as Light Horse , to
Williamsburg	LOCATION	.

		Adieu , I hear
Musquetry	PERSON	, exercising only I hope , for they fire regularly in Platoons .

Colony	ORGANIZATION	in General
Congress	ORGANIZATION	assembled May it please your Honours , We the
Committee of Correspondance	ORGANIZATION	of the Several Towns in sd County beg leave to Represent to your Honours the Circumstances of this County in this day of Strugel & Danger ー in the first place we confess our Towns have in general heretofore been negligent in providing Arms and Amunition according to
Law	PERSON	, until distress came upon us , from our Mother Country & then were debar 'd from having them from thence where we were wont to Purchase them , since which we have not been able to furnish our selves ー and in the next place we are in a distress 'd Scituation with respect to provision for our people to subsist upon till their years Crops come in owing in part to their last year Crops of Corn being cut short by the Drought & so many of our People not being Farmers but Lumbering Sailors & ca togather with the Difficulty and Danger there now is of getting any from the Southern Goverments , owing to their carefullness to keep a sufficient supply for their own people in this day of Expence and the hazzard of having it taken by the Men of
Warr	PERSON	and Tenders , could we procure any of them & where to fly for Relief but to your Honors we know not : Notwithstanding these difficultys we can with pleasure say that the people of this County , almost Universally , are zealous in the
Cause of Constitutional Liberty	ORGANIZATION	and have exerted themselves in Complying with the Recommendations of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and in particular in Raising a Regiment of hardy & Spirited men for the Service of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, who have been Exercising every day as we Understand , for sometime past , and expected to be sent for to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, till lately we have the satisfaction to hear the
Army	ORGANIZATION	is like to be Compleat without them ー We would likewise Represent to your Honours that We are exposed to our Enemies by Sea and Land , by
Sea our Sheep & Cattle	ORGANIZATION	on the
Islands	LOCATION	and Shores are expos 'd to be Ravag 'd by every little Tender that may be sent to get fresh Meat for their Fleet and
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and by Land we may be Alarm 'd by the Inroads of our Old Enemies the Indians & French , tho ' we hope better things from them .

		Wherefore we pray your Honours to take our plain and Just representation into Consideration and if Possible find out some way whereby we may be Supply 'd with some Arms , Ammunition and Provision , and that the Regiment Inlisted here , may be Stationed Amoung us , paid and subsisted at the Charge of the Publick , for our Defence , until they shall be more wanted Elsewhere , in which Case they will be Ready to March on the first Notice , and while here to be Employ 'd in such a manner as may be most for our Safty and Advantage , And that they may pass muster here , by some person that may be Appointed for that Purpose , Your Honours favourable answer to our Request will much Oblige this County of

Williamsburg	LOCATION	1st May 1775 Sir The People of this Colony are taking up Arms in all Parts of it , and every Species of Violence is threatned to be executed upon me , unless I restore some Gunpowder which I though it my duty to remove from a Magazine in this Town to Onboard the Fowey .

		I have reason to believe that the Show which I have made of defending myself by Arming the Persons of my Family and the Assistance given me by Captain
-LSB- George -RSB- Moritagu	PERSON	and
Mr Stretch of the Fowey	PERSON	and Lieutenant -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Collins	PERSON	of his Majesty 's Armed Schooner -LSB-
Magdalen	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- , whose Zeal and Spirit on this occasion I take this Opportunity of acknowledging , have alone prevented hitherto , the People from putting their threats into execution , but as the Commotion is becoming hourly more general , I have thought it necessary to apply to General -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	for such Assistance as he may be enabled to send me ; And I do likewise to You Sir , for one of the large Ships of War now under your Command , if She can be spared from other Services .

		Such a Ship having so considerable a body of Men Onboard , as the Rivers here have , even very high up , great depth of Water , would strike Awe over the whole Country , and a small Post Onshore under the Protection of the Guns of such a Ship would maintain itself against all the efforts which are in the power of an undisciplined Multitude to make , and would afford a Protection to the Well affected of this Country that might probably then be induced to declare themselves and unite for our common Safety .

		Men of such a Ship might likewise be spared to cruize in Boats or the small Craft of this Country , about the Mouths of all the Rivers to prevent , effectually , all the
Contraband Trade	ORGANIZATION	, and particularly the Admission of Arms and Ammunition into the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	; in short Sir , I rely upon your Zeal for his Majs Service for either this or such other Assistance as You may be in a Condition to afford me on the present emergency .

		I have requested Captain
Montagu	PERSON	to detain
Lieutt Colins	PERSON	with the
Magdalen	LOCATION	, and I have been obliged to intreat the former Gentleman to receive

		LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	TO GENERAL THOMAS GAGE 1 Copy .

		/
Williamsburg	LOCATION	1st May 1775 Sir .

		/ The Inhabitants of most of the Counties of this Colony are in Commotion , and a Body of two Thousand Men are now Actually preparing to March to the Assault of my
House	ORGANIZATION	, defended only by my self and the Persons belonging to my Family , the Occasion of which Insurrection is no greater than my having Conveyed from the Magazine in this Town the Powder which was therein -LRB- and which I thought too much exposed there to the Attempts of the People -RRB- to on Board a Man of War Stationed here , the only place of Safety where it could be lodged.ー The Corporation of this place , have presented an Address to me under the Muskets of their
Independant Company	ORGANIZATION	which they left only at a little distance from my house when they came to me to demand a restitution of the Powder which however I have not Complied with , And their Armed Men thought proper unexpectedly to disperse , but I have daily received fresh insults from other bodies of Armed Men appearing in Town from the Country , and am now in expectation of the Arrival of the Above mentioned People whose Numbers encourage them to persist in the Undertaking .

		I have been Obliged to Send Lady
Dunmore	PERSON	and my Children on Board the Fowey Man of War , and with the little though cheerfull Assistance given me by Captain
-LSB- George -RSB- Montague	PERSON	and his Officers , and Lieutenant -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Collins	PERSON	of the
Magdalen Armed Schooner	ORGANIZATION	, Joined to the People of my own family I have put myself in the best posture of defence of which our Numbers are Capable , but can not expect to make any effectual resistance , if as is threatened the People make very resolute efforts against us , and we shall theefore , probably be obliged to retire towards the Ship , which I shall delay as long as is prudent : but these proceedings already make the rebellious spirit of those people Sufficiently Manifest , and therefore I think it Necessary to apply to you for such immediate Assistance , as the Circumstances of the Affairs in which you are yourself engaged , and your Orders and Instructions may permit you to Afford me .

		Two or Three Hundred Men or even one Hundred would probably prevent my being driven out of the Government , and enable me to Maintain an Entrenched Post on the Bank of one of the Rivers under the Protection of the Guns of a Man of War , till I receive orders from Home , and by displaying the
Kings Standard	ORGANIZATION	perhaps our Numbers might be increased , by the well affected of the Country , so as to be able to make head against the Insurgents , but without some Appearance of force to protect the first who venture to me , I despair of receiving any Assistance from the Country .

		I write to the Admiral at the same time to request one of the large Ships to be sent here which would have a very good effect , if the Service in which the Men of War are engaged will permit him to give me that Support .

		I am Sir , & ca
Dunmore	PERSON	1 .

LORD DUNMORE	ORGANIZATION	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LRB- No 26 -RRB-
Williamsburg	LOCATION	1st May 1775 .

		My Lord The series of dangerous measures pursued by the People of this Colony against Government , which they have now entirely overturned , & particularly their having come to a Resolution of raising a Body of armed Men in all the Counties , made me think it prudent to remove some Gunpowder which was in a Magazine in this place , where it lay exposed to any attempt that might be made to seize it , & I had reason to believe the People intended to take that step .

		I accordingly requested of Lieut. -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Collins	PERSON	commanding His Majesty 's armed Schooner the
Magdalen	LOCATION	, to convey the Powder on board the Foway -LSB- sic ! -RSB-

		Man of War now on this station , which that Officer , with a party of his Seamen Diligently executed ; but tho ' it was intended to have been done privately , Mr.
Collins	PERSON	& his party were observed , & notice was given immediately to the Inhabitants of this place , Drums were then sent thro ' the City ー The
Independent Company	ORGANIZATION	got under Arms ー All the People assembled , & during their consultation , continual threats were brought to my
House	ORGANIZATION	, that it was their Resolution to seize upon , or massacre me , & every person found giving me assistance if I refused to deliver the Powder immediately into their Custody .

		In a short time the Mayor & Corporation came to my house leaving their armed force at a little distance , with an Address in reality milder in terms than I expected , but still from the maner in which it was presented can be deemed , if not a treasonable proceeding , at least nothing less than one of the highest insults that could be offered to the
Authority of His Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's Government .

		The Address represents the alarm into which the People had been thrown at the taking away the Powder in a private manner by an armed force , particularly at a time when they are apprehensive of Insurrections among their Slaves -LRB- some reports having prevailed to this effect -RRB- & concludes with a request amounting to a peremptory demand that the Powder be delivered up immediately to them .

		I thought proper , in the defenceless state in which I find myself to endeavor to sooth them and answered verbally to the effect , that I had removed the Powder lest the Negroes might have seized upon it to a place of security from whence , when I saw occasion , I would at any time , deliver it to the People , ー But in the ferment in which they then appeared it would be highly improper to put it into their hands , as it would be inconsistent with the
Authority	ORGANIZATION	I represented to comply with any demand made in the manner of the present .

		This did not satisfy them & the fury of the People was still represented to me as uncontroulable & the dreadful consequences of it as not to be averted by any other means than complying with their humour , to which I replied only by declaring , I would never depart from the resolution which I had already signified to them I had taken , & by arming myself and the persons of my family to oppose the threatened Attempts .

		There happened to be then in Town , Capt -LSB-
George -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	commanding the
Fowey	PERSON	, with his
Capt of Marines	ORGANIZATION	, a Mr Stretch ー & Lieut
Henry Collins	PERSON	the Officer already mentionedThese gentlemen immediately joined themselves to my little party , & offered me all the Assistance which could be spared from on board the Ship & Schooner , which only amounts to between 30 & 40 Men .

		I was not long after unexpectedly informed the People , by the persuasion of Mr
Peyton Randolph	PERSON	& Mr -LSB-
Robert Carter	PERSON	-RSB-
Nicholas	PERSON	-LSB- III -RSB- the Treasurer , had dispersed & appeared satisfied with the answer which I had returned ー But parties of armed Men were continually coming into Town from the adjacent Counties the following days , offering fresh insults ー and two days ago , three gentlemen of principal families in the Country , arrived deputed as they declared , from a body of 2000 , armed Men , who were collected in the neighbourhood of
Fredericksbourg	LOCATION	, about 100 miles , from this place , & who only waited to be informed by these Messengers that I would deliver up the Powder , as they were determined otherwise to proceed to
Williamsburg	LOCATION	& assault my house , & spare neither me , nor any person adhering to me .

		The Messengers , as they were informed the Powder would not be given up returned vowing the vengeance of their enraged Confederates against me , & I am consequently in hourly expectation of their appearance .

		Some of the families have removed from here to avoid the scene that is expected .

		I have been obliged to send Lady Dunmore & my children on board the Man of War , & I shall remain here until I am forced out ー But as I can not expect to be able to make any effectual resistance in this place against the numbers that are said to be moving towards me , I intend to retire towards the
Town of York	LOCATION	, where the Man of War , a 20 gun ship & an armed Schooner lie , under the protection of the Guns of which , & under cover of a little entrenchment which I shall throw up , or at worst on board the Men of War , I shall wait for His Majesty 's Orders , & I have already signified to the Magistrates of
Williamburg	LOCATION	, that I expect them on their allegiance to fall upon means of putting a stop to the march of the People now on their way , before they enter this City , that otherwise I shall be forced , & it is my fixed purpose , to arm all my own Negroes , & receive all others that will come to me , whom I shall declare free ー That I do en join the Magistrates & all others professing to be loyal Subjects , to repair to my assistance , or that I shall consider the whole Country in an actual state of Rebellion , & myself at liberty to annoy it by every possible means , & that I shall not hesitate at reducing their houses to ashes & spreading devastation wherever I can reach .

		I have likewise summoned the
Council	ORGANIZATION	to attend me about the time which these Insurgents are expected here .

		I have dispatched a small Vessel to
Boston	LOCATION	to Genl -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	& Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	, requesting of the one a small Body of Men , & of the other one of the large Ships under his command ー The appearance of such a ship in the interior parts of this Country , where the great depth of water in the Rivers here will permit it to go , would strike the greatest awe , & if I obtain 2 or 300 Men , who might be entrenched under the protection of the guns of such a Man of War , they would there -LRB- tho ' I should receive no assistance from among the People here -RRB- at least 'till I can receive His Majesty 's orders to regulate my future conduct , protect me & those Officers of Government who would choose to attend me , & I have reason to believe this would be sufficient to determine many persons to join me , who hitherto from the terror spread by the Committees & other disturbers of Government have been deterred from ever declaring their sentiments .

		Whatever may be the issue of this present Insurrection in this Colony , or whether the People will now proceed or not to the atrocious extremities which they have been hardy enough now to avow their intentions of committing ー Their conduct has already afforded sufficient evidence of the rebellious spirit with which they are possessed , And therefore if
His Majesty	PERSON	thinks it necessary to maintain an appearance of Authority in this Colony during the unhappy struggle between
America	LOCATION	&
Great Britain	LOCATION	, 2 it can not be affected without a force to support it , which I am in hopes His Majesty will judge requisite to send me , that I may be enabled to protect myself & the other faithful Officers and Friends of Government , who knowing themselves in security will , I am persuaded , exert their utmost efforts , in the service of His Majesty .

		Every person who has manifested the least partiality to the King 's Government , are now become suspected by their furious Countrymen , & are in the greatest danger of falling victims to the rage & violence which accompany all the transactions of these People pretending to contend for Liberty .

		If the servants of the Crown should be of opinion that the
Authority of Government	ORGANIZATION	ought to be inforced here , I am persuaded that if
His Majesty	PERSON	should think proper to add to a small Body of Troops to be sent here , a quantity of Arms , Ammunition , & other requisites , for the Service , I could raise such a Force from among Indians , Negroes , & other persons , as would soon reduce the refractory People of this Colony to Obedience .

John Page	PERSON	,

		The Governor was pleased to address himself to the Board in the following manner : Gentlemen , Commotions and insurrections have suddenly been excited amongthe people , which threaten the very existence of his Majesty 's government in this colony ; and no other cause is assigned for such dangerous measures than that the gunpowder which had , some time past , been brought from on board one of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's ships to which it belonged and was deposited in the magazine of this city , hath been removed , which , it is known , was done hy my order , to whom , under the constitutional right of the crown which I represent , the custody and disposalof all public tores of arms and ammunition alone belong ; and , whether I acted in this manner -LRB- as my indispensable duty required -RRB- to anticipate the malevolent designs of the enemies to order and government , or to prevent the attempts of anyenterprising Negroes ; the powder being still as ready and convenient for beingdistributed for the defence of the country upon any emergency as it was before , which I have publicly engaged to do , the expediency of the step I have taken is equally manifest , and therefore it must be evident that the same head-strong and designing people , who have already but too successfully employed their artifices in deluding his Majesty 's faithful subjects , and in seducing them from their dutyand allegiance , have seized this entirely groundless subject of complaint , only to enflame afresh , and to precipitate as many as possible of the unwary into acts .

		which involving them in the same guilt , their corruptors think may bind them to the same plans and schemes which are unquestionably meditated in this colony , for subverting the present and erecting a new form of government .

		Induced by an unaffected regard for the general welfare of the people , whom I have had the honour of governing , as well as actuated by duty and zeal in the service of his Majesty , I call upon you , his council in this colony , for your advice upon this pressing occasion , and I submit to you , whether a proclamation should not issue conformable to what I have now suggested ; and , before our fellow subjects abandon themselves totally to extremities , which must inevitably draw down an accumulation of every human misery upon their unhappy country , to warn them of their danger , to remind them of the sacred oaths of allegiance which they have taken , and to call up in their hearts that loyalty and affection , which upon so many occasions have been professed by them to their King , their lawful Sovereign ; and further , to urge and exhort , in particular , those whose criminal proceedings on this occasion have been , < ; tnd are still , so alarming , to return to their duty , and a due obedience to the law ; and , in general , all persons whatsoever to rely upon the conduct and tenderness of our most gracious Sovereign to all his subjects , equally , and upon the wisdom of his councils , for a redress of all their real grievances , which redress can only be obtained by constitutional applications ; and , lastly , to enjoin all orders of people to submit , as becomes good subjects , to the legal authority of their government , in the protection of which their own happiness is most interested .

		The council thereupon acquainted his Excellency , that as the matters he had been pleased to communicate to them were of the greatest consequence , they desire time to deliberate thereon till the next day .

		MAJOR GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	TO
JONATHAN TRUMBULL	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF
CONNECTICUT	ORGANIZATION	1 Copy
Boston	LOCATION	3d May 1775 ー Sir I am to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th April last , in behalf of the
General Assembly of your Colony	ORGANIZATION	, relative to the Alarming situation of
Public Affairs	ORGANIZATION	in this Country , and the late transactions in this Province .

		That this situation is greatly alarming , and that these Transactions are truly unfor tunate , are truths to be regretted by every Friend to
America	LOCATION	, and by every well
Wisher	PERSON	for the Peace , Prosperity , and happiness of this Province ; The Intimate Connection , and strong ties of Friendship , between the Inhabitants of your
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and the deluded People of this Province , can not fail of Inducing the former , to interpose their good Offices , to convince the latter , of the Impropriety of their past Conduct , and to perswade them to return to their Allegiance , and to seek redress of any supposed Grievances , in those decent , and constitutional Methods , in which alone they can hope to be Successfulー That Troops should be employed for the purpose of protecting the Magis trates , in the execution of their Duty , when Opposed with Violence is not a new thing , in the English , or any other Government .

		That any Acts of the
British Parliament	ORGANIZATION	are unconstitutional or Oppressive , I am not to suppose ; if any such there are , in the Apprehension of the People of this Province , it had been happy for them , if they had sought relief , only in the way which the Constitution , their reason , and their Interest pointed outー You can not wonder at my Fortifying the Town of
Boston	LOCATION	, or making any other military preparations , when you are Assured , that previous to my taking these Steps , such were the open threats , and such the Warlike preparations , throughout this Province , as rendered it my indispensable duty to take every precaution in my power , for the protection of his Majesty 's Troops under my Command against all hostile Attemptsー The
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	you seem to have received , relative to the late Excurtion of a Body of Troops into the Country , is altogether injurious , and Contrary to the true State of Facts .

		The Troops disclaim with Indignation , the barbarous Outrages of which they are accused , so contrary to their known Humanity .

		I have taken the greatest pains to Discover if any were committed , and have found Examples of their , Tenderness , both to the
Young	PERSON	, and the Old ; but no Vestige of Cruelty or Barbarity .

		It is very possible that in Firing into Houses , from whence they were fired upon , that Old People , Women , or Children , may have suffered , but if any such thing has happened , it was in their defence , and undesigned .

		I have no Command to ravage and desolate the Country ; and were it my Intention , I have had pretence to begin it , upon the Sea Ports , who are at the Mercy of the Fleet , for your better information , I inclose you a Narrative of that Affair , taken from Gentlemen of indisputable Honor , and Veracity , who were Eye Witnesses of all the Transactions of that Day .

		The Leaders here have taken pains to prevent any Account of this Affair getting abroad , but such as they have thought proper to publish themselves ; and to that End , the
Post	ORGANIZATION	has been stopped , the Mails broke open , and Letters taken out ; and by these Means the most injurious and inflammatory Accounts have been spread throughout the Continent , which has served to deceive and inflame the Minds of the Peopleー When the Resolves of the Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, breathed nothing but War , when those two great , and essential Prerogatives of the King , the levying of Troops , and disposing of the public Monies , were wrested from him ; and when Magazines were forming , by an Assembly of Men , unknown to the Constitution , for the declared purpose of levying War against the King ; You must acknowledge it was my Duty , as it was the dictate of Humanity , to prevent if Possible , the Calamities of a Civil War , by destroying such Magazines ー This , and this alone , I Attemptedー You Ask , Why is the Town of
Boston	LOCATION	now shut up ; I can only refer you for an Answer , to those Bodies of Armed Men , who now surround the Town , and prevent all Access to it .

		The hostile preparations you mention , are such as the Conduct of the People of this Province , has rendered it prudent to make , for the defence of those under my Command .

		You assure me the People of your
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, abhor the Idea of taking Arms against the Troops of their Sovereign ; I wish the People of this Province ; -LRB- for their own Sakes -RRB- could make the same declarationー You enquire , is there no way to prevent this unhappy dispute , from coming to Extremities , is there no Alternative , but Absolute Submission , or the desolations of War , I answer , I hope there is .

		The King and
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	seem to hold out Terms of Reconciliation , consistent with the Honor and Interest of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and the rights and Priviledges of the Colonies .

America	LOCATION	.

		I must add likewise , the Resolution of the 27th February on the grand dispute of Taxation and Revenue ; leaving it to the Colonies , to Tax themselves , under certain conditions .

		Here is surely a Foundation for an Accomodation , to People who wish a reconciliation , rather than a destructive War between Countrys so nearly connected , by the Ties of Blood and Interest , but I fear the Leaders of this Province , have been , and still are , intent only on Shedding Bloodー I am much Obliged by your favourable Sentiments of my personal Character ; and Assure you , as it has been my constant Wish and Endeavour hitherto , so I shall continue to Exert my utmost Efforts , to protect all his Majesty 's liege Subjects under my Care , in their Persons and Property .

		You ask , Whether it will not be consistent with my Duty , to suspend the Operations of War on my part ; I have commenced no Operations of War , but Def encive , such you can not wish me to Suspend , while I am surrounded by an Armed Country , who have already begun , and threaten farther to prosecute an offensive War ; and are now Violently depriving me , the Kings Troops and many others of the Kings Subjects under my Immediate protection , of all the conveniences , and
Necessary 's of Life	ORGANIZATION	, with which the Country abounds .

		but it must quiet the minds of all reasonable People , when I assure you , that I have no disposition to injure or Molest , quiet and peaceable Subjects ; but on the contrary , shall esteem it my greatest happiness to defend , and protect them , against every Species of Violence , and Oppressionー I am with great Regard and Esteem ー Sir -LSB- & c :] Tho s

CADWALLADER COLDEN	PERSON	, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF
NEW YORK	LOCATION	, TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
New York	LOCATION	, May 3d 1775 My Lord , The minds of the people in this city were kept in constant agitation , by Riots and attempts to prevent the Transports from loading here , with stores , Provisions & c. for the army .

		The want of any degree of Resolution in the Magistrates to support the authority of Government in opposition to popular measures , rendered the leaders of the People insolently bold and daring ー The friends of order and Government saw no power either in the exertions of the Magistrates or the feeble aid that could be afforded by the very small body of Troops quartered in the city to protect their persons and property from violence and destruction .

		Several Incidents combined to depress all legal
Authority	ORGANIZATION	; and to increase the Terror of the Inhabitants , which seemed to vanquish every thought of Resistance to popular Rage .

		In this unfortunate situation of the City , the first accounts of an action between the Kings Troops and People , near
Boston	LOCATION	, was published with horrid and aggravating circumstances .

		The moment of consternation and anxiety was seized .

		The people were assembled , and that scene of disorder and violence begun , which has entirely prostrated the
Power of Government	ORGANIZATION	and produced an association by which this Province had solemnly united with the others in resisting the Acts of Parliement ... The pretence given out for the necessity of shutting up the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	, was to prevent the exportation of Provisions of which it was said all that was in the place would be wanted for the armies of the Colonies .

		But it is more probable , My Lord , that the real intention was to strike terror by the boldness of the action .

		Having effected this purpose and established the absolute Power of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	; the Keys of the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	have been returnd to Mr -LSB-
Andrew -RSB- Elliott	PERSON	, 2 but at the same time a declaration -LSB- was -RSB- published that no vessell shall be suffered to cleador
Boston	LOCATION	or
Halifax	LOCATION	The whole military Force we have in this Province , my Lord , is the Kings Fisher sloop of War and 100 men of the Royal Irish Regiment commanded by Major -LSB-
Isaac -RSB- Hamilton	PERSON	.

		This small Body of Troops are quartered in the City Barracks without any kind of Protection but in their arms 1 .

Andrew Elliot	PERSON	wrote a full description of his experiences during the period referred to in Golden 's letter .

		It was contained in what he entitled , `` A Short Detail of the Conduct of the Collector of
New York	LOCATION	from December 1774 to March 1776 when the Intercourse Act took place ー Commencing with the Account of the Seizure of Arms & Published in the Newspapers at
New York	LOCATION	the 29th December 1774 . ''

		This document is in the Andrew Elliot Papers ; Box 1 , Folder 6 , NYSL .

		It reads in part : Soon after the affair of
Lexington	LOCATION	-LRB- in April 1775 -RRB- was known in
New York	LOCATION	, a Meeting of the People was called in the Fields , from which Meeting 300 Men under Arms Marched with a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to the
Collectors House	ORGANIZATION	in the Country where he than was , ー the Gentlemen of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	behaved with great Politeness to Mr
Elliot	PERSON	and his Family but demanded the Keys of the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	, and a Promise from Him that he would Enter or Clear no more Vessels agreeable to the British Acts of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		ー The Collector told them that the Keys to the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	were always left with his Deputy Mr
Moore	PERSON	who resided at the Office ー that he was under Oath to Perform the Duties of Collector of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	at
New York	LOCATION	, which he was determined to do as long as it was in his Power Upon this the
Gentlemen of the Committee	ORGANIZATION	told him , he would not be Suffered to Act in character of Collector any longer ー The Collector pointing to the Bayonets at the Doors and Windows of his
House	ORGANIZATION	, told them they had given him a full view of their power , what use they meant to make of it rested entirely with themselves ; After this Conversation the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	and Armed Men march 'd off , and went directly to the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	, and finding the Keys in the Doors -LRB- the Collector having sent one of his Servants who got to Town before the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	with orders for that purpose -RRB- The Whole Body returned to the Fields with the Keys , The Collector immediately waited upon the Lieutenant Governor , and told him what had hapened , As the Governor had then no
Power	PERSON	left , he desired the Collector to act as he should think best .

		The Collector returned to his
House	ORGANIZATION	in the Country and never appeared in Town whilst the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	was lock 'd up and under Guards : but he informed the Captain of the Man of War what had passed , that all outward bound Vessels might be stopped ; He declined speaking on the Subject with all the Merchants who called upon him ; The greatest part of the Merchants were much alarmed and sent off an Express to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; It was soon found out that the heated frolick was a bad one ; at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	it appeared so at once ; The
Merchants	ORGANIZATION	there sent a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to
New York	LOCATION	, when it was soon agreed to send back the Keys ; The
Committee of Philadelphia Merchants	ORGANIZATION	and one of the
New York Merchants	ORGANIZATION	, sent to desire a Meeting with the Collector , who informed them he did no business in his present situation , and could not till the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	was opened , that he wanted no appologies , he only wanted to do his duty ; Early next Morning he was informed the Custom House Doors were opened and the Guard withdrawn , upon which at the usual hour he attended Business without taking any Notice of what had passed , as in the Situation Affairs were then in , it appeared to him best to let a Matter drop ; that all now disapproved of altho ' too many had been concerned in it .

		PROCLAMATION BY LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF
VIRGINIA	ORGANIZATION	1 At a Council held at the Palace -LSB-
Williamsburg	LOCATION	-RSB- May 3 , 1775 , Present , his Excellency the Governor ,
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	,
Richard Corbin	PERSON	,
William Byrd	PERSON	,
Ralph Wormeley	PERSON	, jun. .

		Esquires ,
John Camm	PERSON	, Clerk , and
John Page	PERSON	,
Esquire	PERSON	.

		The Board , resuming the consideration of the subject laid before them yesterday by the Governor , advised him to issue the following proclamation ; and the same was ordered accordingly .

		By his Excellency , the Right Hon.
JOHN	PERSON	,
Earl of DUNMORE	PERSON	, his Majesty 's Lieutenant and Governor General of the
Colony and Dominion	ORGANIZATION	of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and Vice Admiral of the same : A PROCLAMATION .


VIRGINIA	LOCATION	, to wit .

		WHEREAS there is too much reason to suppose that some persons , in the different parts of this colony , are disaffected to his Majesty 's government , and by their weight and credit with the people are endeavouring to bring the Country into such a situation as to afford them the fairest prospect of effecting a change in the form of it , covering their wicked designs under the specious appearance of defending their liberties , and have taken advantage of the unhappy ferment , which themselves have raised in the minds of their fellow subjects , in prosecution of their dangerous designs to oppose the most undoubted prerogative of the King , which in a late instance I thought it expedient to exert by removing on board his Majesty 's ship the Fowey , a small quantity of gunpowder belonging to his Majesty , from the magazine in this city ; I have thought fit , by advice of his Majesty 's council , to issue this my proclamation , with a view of undeceiving the deluded , and of exposing to the unwary the destruction into which they may be precipitated , if they suffer themselves to be longer guided by such infatuated counsels .

		Although I consider myself , under the authority of the crown , the only constitutional judge , in what manner the munition , provided for the protection of the people of this government , is to be disposed of for that end ; yet for effecting the salutary objects of this proclamation , and removing from the minds of his Majesty 's subjects the groundless suspicions they have imbibed , I think proper to declare that the apprehensions which seemed to prevail throughout this whole country of an intended insurrection of the slaves , who had been seen in large numbers , in the night time , about the magazine , and my knowledge of its being a very insecure depository , were my inducements to that measure , and I chose the night as the properest season , because I knew the temper of the times , and the misinterpretations of my design which would be apt to prevail if the thing should be known .

		Acting under these motives , I certainly rather deserved the thanks of the country than their reproaches .

		But , whenever the present ferment shall subside , and it shall become necessary to put arms into the hands of the militia , for the defence of the people against a foreign enemy , or intestine insurgents , I shall be as ready as on a late occasion to exert my best abilities in the service of the country .

		In the mean time , as it is indispensibly necessary to maintain order and the authority of the laws , and thereby the dignity of his Majesty 's government , I exhort and require , in his Majesty 's name , all his faithful subjects , to leave no expedient unessayed which may tend to that happy end .

		Such as are not to be influenced by the love of order for its own sake , and the blessings it is always productive of , would do well to consider the internal weakness of this colony , as well as the dangers to which it is exposed from a savage enemy who ; from the most recent advices I have received from the frontier inhabitants , are ready to renew their hostilies against the people of this country .

		But , as on the one hand , nothing can justify men , without proper authority , in a rapid recurrence to arms , nothing excuse resistance to the executive power in the due enforcement of law , so on the other , nothing but such resistance and outrageous proceedings shall ever compel me to avail myself of any means that may carry the appearance of severity .

		Anxious to restore peace and harmony to this distracted country , and to induce a firmer reliance on the goodness and tenderness of our most gracious Sovereign to all his subjects equally , and on the wisdom of his councils for a redress of all their real grievances , which can only be obtained by loyal and constitutional applications , I again call upon and require all his Majesty 's liege subjects , and especially all magistrates and other officers , both civil and military , to exert themselves in removing the discontents , and suppressing the spirit of faction , which prevail among the people , that a dutiful submission to the laws of the land may be strictly observed , which shall ever be the rule of my conduct , as the interest and happiness of this dominion ever have been , and shall continue to be , the objects of my administration .

		Given under my hand , and the seal of the colony , at
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, this 3d day of May , 1775 , and in the 15th year of his Majesty 's reign .

		Sir , Since my Letter to you of the 24h Ult : by
Ensign Hill	PERSON	, the greater part of the people in this part of the Country have been constantly under Arms , threatning destruction to the Persons and Properties of those who refuse to join with them ; in the Town of
Brunswick	LOCATION	near
Kennebeck River	LOCATION	, two Hundred of them Assembled , took Mr -LSB-
Edward -RSB- Parry	PERSON	the Contractors Agent for the
Navy Masts	ORGANIZATION	into Custody and all the Masts in the River belonging to him , which they hourly threaten to destroy : they also laid hold of Five of the principal Friends to Government , one of which they buried Alive , and put the rest in Jail ; 2 as soon as they had finished this , they resolved to embark on board of Two Sloops in order to repair to
Falmouth	LOCATION	, board , and burn the Canceaux , and the two Vessels she has in Charge , this Resolution was made known here , the Night before last , upon which their Associates of the
Town	ORGANIZATION	assembled , disapproved of the Plan , and refused Assistance , excepting Major -LSB-
Enoch -RSB- Freeman	PERSON	and the lower Class ; ー this Man I have mentioned in my former Letters as a leading Instrument of Sedition in these parts , and it is a great pity he should be left so long among them .

		Since I was made acquainted with this History I have dared them to put their Plan in execution though the Ship is not manned equal to my wishes , yet the few Hands that I have picked up since I have been here , gives me a fairer prospect of the safety of those Vessels I have in Charge .

		The new Ship is now almost in a Condition to go to Sea , which she would have been some time ago , had the Smiths and Carpenters been suffered to work , the labourers to a Man refuse to load , and as yet Mr.
-LSB- Thomas -RSB- Coulson	PERSON	has not been able to procure any Seamen , although he has used every means , not only here , but at
Marblehead	LOCATION	and
Salem	LOCATION	, to which place he sent the Master of his Sloop for that purposeー The Friends of Government of this Town , have represented their situation to General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, and they have also requested me to spare them an Officer and a few Hands to go in a Vessel to
Boston	LOCATION	, which they have hired for that purpose ; a Copy of which Application I herewith enclose : 3 indeed I am happy in this opportunity myself , as I am still without a reply to the Letters that I wrote to Captain -LSB-
Andrew -RSB- Barkley	PERSON	; though I can now have but poor hopes of your sparing any Marines , if there is any truth in the reports that circulate here .

		Mr -LSB-
William -RSB- Tyng	PERSON	the Sheriffe of this County carries the Petition to the General , and at the same time means to pay his respects to You : this Gentleman is well acquainted with the dispositions of the People in this part of the Country and not less so with the Seditious and Rebellious Principles that are daily practiced hereabouts , by which he has suffered not a little .

Association	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- resolved to stand and fall with the freedom of the Continentー We are confident that our Constituents are sincere in the strong assurances they have given us , that while we continue in Office they will be guided by our advice and direction .

		We have thought it necessary to Advise the witholding supplies from the
British Fisheries	ORGANIZATION	on the American coasts , and to cease all exports to those Colonies which at this alarming Juncture refuse to unite in the cause ; The expediency of this measure is too evident to need elucidation , and will doubtless procure us many hearty advocates in
Britain	LOCATION	; besides which we have resolved to withold all provisions and necessaries for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	at Bostonー Our late committee of Observation thought proper to recommend the appointment of a provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; in consequence of which , our constituents have chosen 21 Deputies to meet at this City on the 22d instant , Those , who may be appointed for that purpose in the Other Counties of this Colony ー For your farther satisfaction on these Matters , we beg leave to refer you to the inclosed papers , to request you to communicate the Substance of this Information to your next neighbours , and to Assure you that in our department we shall watch incessantly for the publick Safetyー By order of the

		ROBERT EDEN , GOVERNOR OF
MARYLAND	LOCATION	, TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1
My Lord Annapolis	ORGANIZATION	5 May 1775 .

		I have the Honor of acknowledging the Receipt of your Lordships circular Letter of the 3rd March , and the Parliamentary Resolves and shall do all in my Power to promote in this Province the much to be desired End therein recommended to my Attention .

		Sorry I am , my Lord , to see a continuance of this unnatural Dissension betwixt
Great Britain	LOCATION	and Her Colonies ー but the
Time	ORGANIZATION	is not far distant , I hope , when Peace and Harmony will be restored and Confidence re-established on a permanent Basis ー The
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	is to meet on Wednesday next at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, I need not inform your Lordship how impossible it would be for me to prevent Delegates from hence attending ー The Attempt would have been vain , and only have sent them thither in ill Humour ー On the Contrary , I think I can affirm that the Delegates of
Maryland	LOCATION	-LRB- or a very great Majority of them -RRB- go from hence fully determined to do all in their Power to bring about a Reconciliation .

		The proceedings of the Provincial Convention , which has been sitting these last ten Days and broke up Yesterday , have been conducted with great Temper and Moderation considering the general Spirit of the
Times	ORGANIZATION	, and that , at the beginning of their Deliberations , they received the alarming Account from the Northward of a total Overthrow of His Majesty 's Forces , which was generally believed by them , and which I could no otherwise contradict , -LRB- not having received particulars -RRB- than by declaring that , to me , as a military Man of some Experience , the Accounts varied so , and were all of them so replete with Absurdities , that , without taking the Improbability into Consideration , and the torpid State they must presume the General and Admiral to be in , it could not but be in great part false , and I am happy that it has turned out so , and hope that what has passed , and a Cessation of further Hostilities , may induce the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	immediately to recommend it to the several Colonies , by their Delegates , to make proper Applications respectively for the Redress of the Grievances they Complain of , after the mode pointed out in Your Lordships Letter , and the Parliamentary Resolve ー I shall have the Honor of inclosing the published proceedings of the Convention here , and the Instruction given to the Delegates , as also our Yesterdays and a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Paper , which contains the same and some of the absurd Accounts ; that has been received from the Northward .

		Being well assured that the
Lower House	ORGANIZATION	would not proceed upon any Business before the Meeting at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	stands prorogued by Advice of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	to the 5th of June , and when they Meet , I ardently wish and hope to be enabled to transmit to Your Lordship , such dutifull Applications as His Majesty has been graciously pleased to declare his Readiness to accept , and agreeable to the Resolve of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, and shall impatiently hope for , and most sincerely rejoice at , their happy Effect .

		I have made it my indispensable duty to give the utmost Attention to preserve peace and good Order within this Government , in which it gives me pleasure to think I have not been unsuccessful ー Since my Return I have not slept twice out of this City where I found Disorder had been rather too active during my short Absence .

		I can not in the least , Consistently with that Duty to His Majesty , which will ever govern my Conduct , think , at this Time of Trouble and Danger , of abandoning my Post on account of my private Affairs in
England	LOCATION	ー But , I hope , when Tranquility is restored , His Majesty will not be displeased at my availing myself of the gracious Indulgence I had the Honor of soliciting on that Head when in
England	LOCATION	, and your Lordship may rely on my exerting myself to the utmost in promoting the Accomplishment of Our Gracious Sovereigns ardent Wishes to see a Reconciliation of the unhappy Differences that have given His Majesty so much Concern .

		That His Majesty may long continue to reign in Peace and Tranquillity restored , is the heartfelt Wish of My Lord -LSB- & c. -RSB-

York	LOCATION	river , is partly owned by Mr.
John Wilkinson	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	, who is likewise owner of two ships , the Lion and Brilliant , that formerly loaded in

Wilkinson	PERSON	has let to the Ministry , to carry troops to

		Quere .

		Is it not incumbent on every friend of liberty , and his country , to refuse shipping a single hogshead of tobacco on board any ship belonging to such a bloody-minded man as Mr.
Wilkinson	PERSON	?

		Would it not be as proper to send the Mary back , in balast , as the
Virginia	LOCATION	?

		Her being chartered by another person can not be any good objection to sending her away in ballast , since the charterer must have known of Mr.
Wilkinson	PERSON	's crime before the
Mary	PERSON	left

Williamsburg	LOCATION	, May 5 .

		Late on Wednesday night -LSB- May 3 -RSB- , Col.
Carter Braxton	PERSON	arrived in town , from a number of armed people , all men of property , led by
Patrick Henry	PERSON	,
Esq	PERSON	; on their march for this city , from the counties of
Hanover	LOCATION	,
New Kent	LOCATION	and King
William	PERSON	.

		The intent of their coming , we are well assured , is the general alarm spread over the country by the removal of the gunpowder from the publick magazine , and to secure the treasury from a like ca -LSB- ta -RSB- strophe ; as also to seize upon the person of his Majesty 's Receiver General -LRB- then in this city -RRB- till either the gunpowder was restored , or a sum of money paid down to its value .

		Next morning Col.
Braxton	PERSON	returned , with the Honourable
Richard Corbin	PERSON	's bill of exchange for 320 I. sterling ; and at the same time ; the inhabitants of this city engaging themselves to guard the publick treasury , the Gentlemen dispersed yesterday afternoon , and are returned to their respective homes , perfectly satisfied with the success of their expedition .

		They had proceeded as far as
Doncastl	PERSON	's , about 15 miles from town , where they were encamped to the number of 150 men and upwards , all well accoutred , and had a very martial appearance .

		As soon as his Excellency the Governour received intelligence of the above armed force coming down , he despatched a messenger to the Fowey man of war , now lying before
York	LOCATION	town , and by 10 o'clock yesterday morning a detachment of 40 sailors and marines belonging to that ship , under the command of Capt. Stretch , arrived at the place ; they did not march through the main street , but were led through the governour 's park .

		The town of
York	LOCATION	, we are well informed , was threatened with a cannonade from his Majesty 's ship Fowey , by her commander , if the inhabitants presumed to molest the troops in their landing , or on their march to this city .

		They are now at the palace ; how long they will stay is uncertain .

		Upwards of 100 of the citizens last night guarded the publick treasury , and patrolled the streets .

		This morning a warrant was issued to search certain houses for arms , suspected to have been taken out of the magazine in this city , a considerable number being missing , but the officer , we hear , has not been able to find any .

		The Right Honourable the Countess of
Dunmore	PERSON	, with all the Governour 's family , are now on board the Fowey man of war .

		The Rising Sun ,
Peterson	PERSON	, from
London	LOCATION	, is arrived in
York	LOCATION	river .

		He left the Downs the 13th of March , in company with about 20 transports , who put into Spithead the 16th , to wait their final orders to proceed to
Corke	PERSON	, to take in troops for
America	LOCATION	.

Earl of Dunmore	PERSON	, his Majesty 's Lieutenant and Governor General of the
Colony and Dominion	ORGANIZATION	of

		A PROCLAMATION
Virginia	LOCATION	, to wit .

		WHEREAS I have been informed from undoubted Authority , that a certain
Patrick Henry	PERSON	, of the County of
Hanover	LOCATION	, and a Number of deluded Followers , have taken up Arms , chased their Officers , and styling themselves an
Independent Company	ORGANIZATION	, have marched out of the County , encamped and put themselves in a Posture of War ; and have written and despatched Letters to divers Parts of the Country , exciting the People to join in their outrageous and rebellious Practices , to the great Terror of all his Majesty 's faithful Subjects , and to open Defiance of Law and Government , and have committed other Acts of Violence , particularly in extorting from his Majesty 's Receiver General the Sum of 330 # .

		under Pretence of replacing the Powder I thought proper to order from the Magazine , whence it undeniably appears , that there is no longer the least security for the Life and Property of any Man .

		WHEREFORE I have thought proper , with the Advice of his Majesty 's
Council	ORGANIZATION	, and in his Majesty 's Name , to issue this my Proclamation strictly charging all Persons , upon their allegiance , not to aid , abet or give Countenance to the said
Patrick Henry	PERSON	, or any other persons concerned in such unwarrantable Combinations , but on the contrary to oppose them and their Designs by every Means , which Designs must , otherwise , inevitably involve the whole Country in the direful Calamity , as they will call for the Vengeance of offended Majesty and the insulted Laws , to be exerted here , to vindicate the constitutional
Authority of Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Given under my Hand and the Seal of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, in

Harmony	PERSON	, and a good Understanding may take place on equitable , permanent Foundations , and may ever distinguish
Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and thus continue 'til Time has run his Round .

		`` Upon calm Deliberation , and serious dispassionate Reflection , it is really distressing that from the hasty Resolves of the Majority of the
British Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, without hearing the Petitions from
North America	LOCATION	-LRB- as the Lords Protest sets forth -RRB- should be the Occasion of all such fatal Consequences as have happened and are likely to happen between us ; and unless seasonably redressed may prove the Ruin of the whole Empire .

		Who would have imagined that this Contest would have so soon terminated into an unnatural Civil War , and caused the Effusion of so much Blood ?

		The Prospect .

		is truly melancholy , when the Brother takes away the
Brothers Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		And yet such times
America	LOCATION	now secs and feels !

		Tho ' sure I am , that his Majesty has not more firm and loyal Subjects than in his Dominions in
North America	LOCATION	, who will support his Crown and Dignity in a constitutional manner at the Risque of their Lives and Fortunes .

		But it is impossible that freeborn Englishmen , as we arc , -LRB- instead of being taxed by our legal Representatives as formerly -RRB- should now submit to
Parliamentary Taxations	ORGANIZATION	, without giving up our Title to Freedom , and becoming Vassals and Slaves .

		Nothingmore is necessary for a happy Accommodation , but a Revival of the good old English Constitution , which has always produced such mutual Blessings . ''

Williamsburg	LOCATION	, May 6 .

		A few nights ago some people privately entered the public magazine in this city and took a great number of guns , cartouch boxes , swords , canteens , & c. for which his Excellency the Governor has ordered a diligent search to be made .

		The town of
York	LOCATION	being somewhat alarmed by a letter from Capt.
-LSB- George -RSB- Montague	PERSON	, commander of his Majesty 's ship the
Fowey	PERSON	, addressed to the Hon.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	,
Esq	PERSON	; President of his
Majesty 's Council	ORGANIZATION	in
Virginia	LOCATION	; 1 and a copy of said letter being procured , a motion was made , that the copy should be laid before the committee ; and considered .

		The committee , together with Capt.
Montague	PERSON	's letter , taking into consideration the time of its being sent , which was too late to permit the President to use his influence , had the inhabitants been disposed to molest and attack the detachment ; and further considering that Col.
Nelson	PERSON	, who , had this threat been carried into execution , must have been a principal sufferer , was , at that very moment , exerting his utmost endeavours in behalf of Government , and the safety of his Excellency 's person , unanimously came to the following resolutions : Resolved , that Capt.
Montague	PERSON	, in threatening to fire upon a defenceless town , in case of an attack upon a detachment , in which said town might not be concerned , has testified a spirit of cruelty unprecedented in the annals of civilized times ; that , in his late notice to the President , he has added insult to cruelty ; and that , considering the circumstances , already mentioned , of one of the most considerable inhabitants of said town , he has discovered the most hellish principles that can actuate a human mind .

		Resolved , that it be recommended to the inhabitants of this town , and to the county in general , that they do not entertain or shew any other mark of civility to Capt.
Montague	PERSON	, besides what common decency and absolute necessity require .

		Resolved , that the Clerk do transmit the above proceedings to the public printers to be inserted in the
Virginia	LOCATION	gazettes .

Virginia	LOCATION	May 9th , 1775 We have lately had a great alarm here about the Governor 's removing a large quantity of powder from our magazine and conveying it on board a ship of war : Not less -LSB- than -RSB- 600 men well armed and mounted assembled at
Fredg	LOCATION	.

		on this occasion , with a view to proceed to
Wmsburg	LOCATION	.

		-LSB- to -RSB- recover the powder & revenge the insult : The propriety of such a step was warmly agitated and weighty arguments adduced both for & against it : At length the advice of

Edm	LOCATION	.


Pendleton	PERSON	,
Richd	PERSON	.


H. Lee	PERSON	, and
George Washington Esqrs	PERSON	.

		delegates for the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, to return home was complied with .

		The reasons however that induced these Gentlemen to give this advice did not appear satisfactory to
Patrick Henry Esqr	PERSON	.

		another of our delegates whose sentiments were not known at
Fredg	LOCATION	.

		This Gentleman after the dispersion of the troops at the above named place under the authority of the committee of this County and at the head of an
Independant Company	ORGANIZATION	undertook to procure redress , which he resolutely accomplished by taking of the King 's Quit-rents as much money as would replace the powder which had been removed so far that it could not be come at .

		This affair has prevented his appearing at the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as early as his Colleagues , and has afforded me this opportunity of sending you a few lines .

		I expect his conduct as contrary to the opinion of the other delegats will be disapproved of by them , but it -LSB- has -RSB- gained him great honor in the most spirited parts of the Country and addresses of thanks are already presenting to him from different Quarters : The Gentlemen below whose property will be exposed in case of a civil war in this Colony were extremely alarmed lest Government should be provoked to make reprisals .

		Indeed some of them discovered a pusilanimity little comporting with their professions or the name of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		To the Honble the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	for the Province of the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	in
Cambridge	LOCATION	May it please your Honoursー We , the
Committee of Correspondence	ORGANIZATION	in
Falmouth	LOCATION	wou 'd beg leave to Represent to your Honours , the Situation and Circumstances of this Town and County ; and if there is any Impropriety in our doing it , Your Candour will Excuse itー The Alarming Attempt of
Colln	PERSON	-LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Thompson	PERSON	, to take the Ship Canceaux ,
Captn Henry Mowat	PERSON	Commander , now in this
Harbour	PERSON	, has occasioned very great uneasiness in this Town , as it has a Tendency to bring on us certain Ruin , by the Admiral 's resenting it in such a manner as to block up our Harbour before the Time .

		We have no Force to oppose or prevent it , no Fortifications , no Ammunition , no Cannon , and if Provisions are stopt from coming in here ,
The Town	LOCATION	is ruined as well as the Country , which depends upon the Town for Supplies , of which , at present , there is a great Scarcity .

		ー We think
Coll Thompson	PERSON	's attempt was rash and Injudicious , if not unjustifiable , as we cant learn he had any Authority from You or the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; we are Sure it was contrary to yr will , and without any orders from his Superiour officers in the Militia , though Solicited for by him , and the People here Seemed to be laid under Contribution to Subsist his menー We hope Care will be taken that every Attack upon our Enemies , through the Province , shall be conducted by proper officers , Orderly , Regularly , and with proper
Authority	ORGANIZATION	, lest it should Occasion a civil War Among our selves ー It is true , in defending our selves , which may be Sudden , Immediate and resolute opposition , in the best manner that can be Suddenly thought of , Should be adopted : but we are afraid , that if any number of men , at any Time , and in any Manner , may collect , together and Attack any thing or any Person , they Please , every Body may be in Danger .

		ー Sat verbum Sapienti ー We are also concernd lest there Should a good Deal of Confusion arise , from a Number of our Men in the Country , possessing themselves of the Inlisting Papers lately printed , some calling themselves Colls , some Majors , Appointing their own officers , Adjutants , Chaplains , Chirurgeons , & c , & c , without having , as we can learn , any written orders for so doing : ー for they Seem to contend already , who shall be Chief Officers ; and they are uncertain whether the Men they Inlist , are to be Stationed here for our Defence , or march to the
Camp	LOCATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, to make up the Standing Armyー Enlisting Papers , we understand , were sent to Genl -LSB-
Jedediah -RSB- Preble	PERSON	, but he , not having any written orders did not Act in the Affair .

		ー If the
Army	ORGANIZATION	can be completed without drawing men from home , as we have all along been made to understand was the Case , we cant help thinking it wou 'd be most prudent ; however , we shall not be backward , if there is a real Occasion for Men ; and in that Case , we humbly Submit , whether it would not be best as Some Person or Persons Should be Appointed to Conduct the Affair according to orders ; in the hope we Shall be Excused for thus Troubling Your Honours , as we were Solicited to do it by a Number of Gentlemen We are with great Veneration & c

ETHAN ALLEN	PERSON	'S ACCOUNT OF THE TAKING OF TICONDEROGA 1 -LSB- May 10 , 1775 -RSB- While I was wishing for an opportunity to signalize myself in its -LSB- my country 's -RSB- behalf , directions were privately sent me from the then colony -LRB- now state -RRB- of
Connecticut	LOCATION	to raise the
Green Mountain Boys	ORGANIZATION	, and , if possible , with them to surprise and take the fortress of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	.

		This enterprise I cheerfully undertook ; and , after first guarding all the several passes that led thither , to cut off all intelligence between the garrison and the country , made a forced march from
Bennington	LOCATION	, and arrived at the lake opposite to
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	on the evening of the ninth day of May , 1775 , with two hundred and thirty valiant
Green Mountain Boys	ORGANIZATION	and it was with the utmost difficulty that I procured boats to cross the lake .

		However , I landed eighty-three men near the garrison , and sent the boats back for the rear guard , commanded by Colonel
Seth Warner	PERSON	, but the day began to dawn , and I found myself under a necessity to attack the fort , before the rear could cross the lake ; and , as it was viewed hazardous , I harangued the officers and soldiers in the manner following Friends and fellow soldiers : you have for a number of year past , been a scourge and terror to arbitrary power Your valor has been famed abroad , and acknowledged , as appears by the advice and orders to me , from the
General Assembly of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	, to surprise and take the garrison now before us .

		I now propose to advance before you , and , in person , conduct you through the wicket gate ; for we must this morning either quit our pretensions to valor or possess ourselves of this fortress in a few minutes ; and , inasmuch as it is a desparate attempt , which none but the bravest of men dare undertake , I do not urge it on any contrary to his will .

		You that will undertake voluntarily , poise your firelocks .

		The men being , at this time , drawn up in three ranks , each poised his firelock .

		I ordered them to face to the right : and at the head of the centre file marched them immediately to the wicket gate aforesaid , where I found a sentry posted , who instantly snapped his fusee at me : I ran immediately towards him , and he retreated through the covered way into the parade within the garrison , gave a halloo , and ran under a bomb-proof .

		My party who followed me into the fort , I formed on the parade in such a manner as to face the two barracks which faced each other .

		The garrison being asleep , except the sentries , we gave three huzzas which greatly surprised them .

		One of the sentries made a pass at one of my officers with a charged bayonet , and slightly wounded him .

		my first thought was to kill him with my sword ; but , in an instant , I altered the design and fury of the blow to a slight cut on the side of the head ; upon which he dropped his gun , and asked quarter , which I readily granted him , and demanded of him the place where the commanding officer kept ; he showed me a pair of stairs in the front of a barrack , on the west part of the garrison , which led up to a second story in said barrack , to which I immediately repaired , and ordered the commander , Captain
Delaplace	PERSON	, to come forth instantly or I would sacrifice the whole garrison ; at which the Captain came immediately to the door , with his breeches in his hand , when I ordered him to deliver me the fort instantly : He asked me by what authority I demanded it .

		I answered him , `` In the name of the great
Jehovah	PERSON	, and the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The authority of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	being very little known at that time , he began to speak again ; but I interrupted him , and , with my drawn sword over his head , again demanded an immediate surrender of the garrison ; with which he then complied , and ordered his men to be forthwith paraded without arms , as he had given up the garrison : In the mean time some of my officers had given orders , and in consequence thereof , sundry of the barrack doors were beat down , and about one third of the garrison imprisoned , which consisted of the said commander , a
Lieutenat Feltham	PERSON	, a conductor of artillery , a gunner , two serjeants , and fortyfour rank and file ; about one hundred pieces of cannon , one thirteen inch mortar and a number of swivels .

		This surprise was carried out in the gray of the morning of the tenth day of May 1775 ...
Colonel Warner	ORGANIZATION	, with the rear guard , crossed the lake and joined me early in the morning , whom I sent off without loss of time , with about one hundred men , to take possession of Crown Point , which was garrisoned with a serjeant and twelve men ; which he took possession of the same day , as also of upwards of one hundred pieces of cannon .

		The identity of the writer as
George Cummerford	PERSON	is contained in the letter of August 3 , from Captain
Henry Bryne	PERSON	to Vice Admiral
James Young	PERSON	`` LETTER FROM
FALMOUTH	LOCATION	,
MASS.	LOCATION	, -LSB-
MAINE	LOCATION	PROVINCE -RSB- TO A GENTLEMAN IN
WATERTOWN	LOCATION	, DATED MAY 11 , 1775 . ''

		1 Sir : It may not be disagreeable to you to have a more particular account of the solemn scene that has been acted here for two of three days past , than it can be expected common fame will give you .

		Last Tuesday morning -LSB- May 9 -RSB- , Lieutenant Colonel -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Thompson	PERSON	, of
Brunswick	LOCATION	, with about fifty armed men , with each a small bough of spruce in his hat , and having a spruce pole , with a green top on it for a standard , landed on the back part of our Neck , at a place called
Sandy Point	LOCATION	, where is a thick grove of trees .

		In that place they lay , unknown to the people of the Town , seizing and detaining several persons that happened to pass that way , till about one o'clock , when Captain -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Mowat	PERSON	, the Surgeon of his Ship , and the Reverend Mr. -LSB-
John -RSB- Wiswel	PERSON	, taking a walk that way for their pleasure , were seized and made prisoners .

		As soon as the master of the ship -LRB- one
Hogg	PERSON	-RRB- heard of it , he wrote to Colonel -LSB-
Enoch -RSB- Freeman	PERSON	, that if Captain
Mowat	PERSON	and the other prisoners were not delivered up in an hour or two , -LRB- I do not certainly know the time -RRB- he would lay the Town in ashes .

		You can hardly conceive the consternation , confusion , and uproar that immediately ensued .

		Our women were , I believe , every one of them in tears , or praying , or screaming ; precipitately leaving their houses , especially those whose husbands were not at home , and widows hurrying their goods into countrymen 's carts , never asking their names , though strangers , and carrying their children either out of Town , or up to the south end , according to the greater or less irritability of their nerves .

		Some persons bed-rid , or in childbed , were hastily removed , with no small danger of their lives .

		Several gentlemen of the Town , who could attend it , and I among the rest , immediately repaired to Colonel
Thompson	PERSON	's camp ; and after obtaining leave of the advance guard , were permitted to speak with him .

		We endeavoured to persuade him to deliver up the prisoners , by all the rational arguments we could think of , but he appeared inflexible , and even furious .

		Here and there one in the Town -LRB- none but Tories however -RRB- were at first for rescuing the prisoners by our Militia ; but the general voice of the Town was to observe a strict neutrality , excepting persuasive and arguments .

		Colonel
-LSB- Edmund -RSB- Phinney	PERSON	, of
Gorham	LOCATION	, Colonel of the Minute-Men , being in Town , and fearing a rescue , or for some other reason , sent out for his men , I suppose without asking the advice of any body ; and soon afterwards sent word that they need not come in to Town .

		Night was coming on , and the weather cool and windy , which endangered the health of some of the gentlemen , at least in the open field .

		It was therefore agreed by Colonel
Freeman	PERSON	and his advisers , at the desire of
Mowat	LOCATION	, and by the free consent of
Thompson	PERSON	, that the company of Cadets should escort the party and the prisoners to Mr.
-LSB- Brackett	PERSON	-RSB-
Marston	PERSON	's , in order that a consultation might be further held there .

		The two companies remained embodied before the door .

		Colonel
Thompson	PERSON	remained unwilling to deliver up the prisoners , insisting much that
Divine Providence	ORGANIZATION	had thrown them into his hands , and that it was open and settled war between the Colonies and
Britain	LOCATION	.

		But he was more and more convinced that the whole force of the Town was against him , and found himself disappointed of a reinforcement that he expected to meet him here ; so that `` by about nine o'clock in the evening he was much cooled ; and the prisoners giving their parole that they would deliver themselves into his hands at nine the next morning , General -LSB-
Jedediah -RSB- Preble	PERSON	and Colonel
Freeman	PERSON	pledging themselves for them , he consented to set them at liberty .

		Upon which
Mowat	PERSON	having expressed his gratitude to the Town in strong terms , went aboard and dismissed a number of our people , who the master had , during the afternoon , caught in boats and made prisoners .

		But when Colonel
Thompson	PERSON	's men found that he had given
Mowat	PERSON	his liberty , they were hard to pacify .

		Not only Colonel
Phinney	PERSON	's Minute-Men , but most of the Militia from
Gorham	LOCATION	,
Scarborough	PERSON	,
Cape Elizabeth	PERSON	, and
Stroudwater	PERSON	, in the whole amounting , it is said to six hundred , came into Town before morning , highly enraged at Captain
Mowat	PERSON	's being dismissed , and seemingly determined to destroy his ship .

		Wednesday morning , when it was found that
Mowat	PERSON	would not deliver himself up , the
Army	ORGANIZATION	took and made prisoners of General
Preble	PERSON	and Colonel
Freeman	PERSON	, threatening to treat them in the same manner as they would treat
Mowat	PERSON	, if they had him .

		Even their children were not permitted to speak with them , and they had no dinner that day .

		All the officers of the companies then present agreed to resolve themselves into a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of War ; and after some hesitation they admitted the officers of our companies on the Neck , into the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	; in which
Committee	ORGANIZATION	a vote was passed by a considerable majority , that Captain
Mowat	PERSON	's ship ought to be destroyed .

		In the next place they appointed a Committee out of their number , to consider in what manner it should be done .

		This Committee have not yet reported as I can find ; but they have proceeded to call men before them who were suspected of being Tories , to question them , to draw promises from them , and especially to draw money and provisions from them .

		The Reverend Mr.
Wiswel	PERSON	delivered himself up very willingly , and seemed rather impatient till they had him with them ; saying to some that passed by his door , he was ready to die at any time , as he knew he was in a good cause ー the cause of the Church of
England	LOCATION	.

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	interrogated him concerning his political principles .

		He declared an abhorrence of the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance , and that he thought
Great Britain	LOCATION	had no right to tax American internally ; but as to the late Acts of
Parlaiment	ORGANIZATION	, he had not examined them , and did not choose to give his opinions concerning them .

		Old Mr.
-LSB- David -RSB- Wyer	PERSON	had a file of men sent after him , who , holding a pistol to his breast , forced him to go before the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	; and when there he was interrogated whether he had said , `` the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	ought to rescue Captain
Mowat	PERSON	? ''

		to which he answered in the affirmative ; also , whether he did not think it an imprudent speech ?

		to which he answered , yes ; also , whether he were of the same mind now ?

		He answered , no , as matters are circumstanced ; then whether he would say any thing again against the body of men in Town ?

		He said , no .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	soon agreed to dismiss him , and one of them said he was not worth their notice .

		He thanked the gentlemen for their civility , made a low bow , and departed .

		Captain
Steward	PERSON	called to the crowd before the door , to make way for Mr.
Wyer	PERSON	, and told them out of the window the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	had dismissed him as unworthy of their notice .

		Captain -LSB-
Jeremiah -RSB- Pote	PERSON	was fetched before the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, without making any resistance , though he had made formidable preparations to defend himself .

		It is reported that the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	made him give them , for the benefit of the body , about fifty Pounds , -LRB- old tenour , -RRB- in cash and provisions , and that they have bound him in a bond of two thousand Pounds , to appear at the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the Province , and give an account of himself to them .

		They taxed General
Preble	PERSON	some barrels of bread ` and a number of cheeses , and two barrels of rum for each company then in Town , which he readily gave them , Wednesday afternoon , in value about ten Pounds , lawful money .

		Wednesday evening they made out a bill of one hundred and fifty-eight Pounds , lawful money , against
Preble	PERSON	and
Freeman	PERSON	, to satisfy the body for their time and trouble in the expedition ; but I hear they have dropped that demand .

		Yesterday morning they entered the house of Captain -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Coulson	PERSON	, and they use it as a barrack .

		The men made so free with a barrel of New-England rum , which they found in the cellar , that some of them were quite , and others almost drunken .

		Between meetings yesterday ,
Calvin Lombard	PERSON	, being raised with liquor , went down to the water side and fired a brace of balls at
Mowat	PERSON	's ship , which penetrated deep in its sides .

		The fire was answered from a fuse on board , but with no aim to do execution .

		Captain
Mowat	PERSON	immediately wrote to Colonel
Freeman	PERSON	to deliver up
Calvin	PERSON	, and to raise the militia to dispel the mob from the country , as he called them , assuring him that otherwise he must fire upon the Town .

		This threw the Town again into a panick , but we had , notwithstanding , a pretty full meeting in the afternoon .

		Yesterday they hauled Captain
Coulson	PERSON	's boat up to the house , where it remained till just now , three quarters after twelve , when near a hundred men hauled it up through the streets and into Captain
-LSB- Moses -RSB- Pearson	PERSON	's back lot , down almost to the Cove .

		It is reported that
Mowat	PERSON	sent word , or wrote on shore last evening , that he had bought that boat of
Coulson	PERSON	, and paid for it , and that if it were not returned immediately , or speedily , he would fire upon the Town .

		He doubtless saw it hauled away just now , but as he has not fired as yet ; and here I sit writing at my desk in the old place , being fully convinced that
Mowat	PERSON	never will fire upon the Town , in any case whatever .

		My house is turned into a kind of barrack .

		Several have removed bedding and other goods into it .

		We are full at nights .

		I dont know why people think themselves as safe here , unless it be because my wife is not yet much affrighted .

		This morning the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	sent to
Deacon -LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Titcomb	PERSON	for one hundred pounds of bread , who returned for answer that he had no bread but what he wanted for himself ; but if the company would go out of
Town	ORGANIZATION	immediately , he would give it to them .

		Colonel
Phinney	PERSON	promised that he would do his utmost endeavour to get them out of Town to-day ; therefore the bread was delivered .

MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY 1 Gentlemen Ticonderoga , May 11 , 1775 I wrote you yesterday tliat arriving in the vicinity of this place , I found one hundred and fifty men collected at the instance of some gentlemen from
Connecticut	LOCATION	-LRB- designed on the same errand on which I came -RRB- headed by Colonel
Ethan Allen	PERSON	, and that I had joined them , not thinking proper to wait the arrival of the Troops I had engaged on the road , but to attempt the Fort by surprise ; that we had taken the Fort at four o'clock yesterday morning without opposition , and had made prisoners , one Captain , one Lieutenant , and forty odd privates and subalterns , and that we found the
Fort	LOCATION	in a most ruinous condition and not worth repairing ; that a party of fifty men were gone to Crown Point , and that I intended to follow with as many men to seize the sloop , & c. and that I intended to keep possession here until I had farther advice from you .

		On and before our taking possession here , I had agreed with Colonel
Allen	PERSON	to issue further orders jointly , until I could raise a sufficient number of men to relieve his people ; on which plan we proceeded when I wrote you yesterday , since which , Colonel
Allen	PERSON	, finding he had the ascendancy over his people , positively insisted I should have no command , as I had forbid the soldiers plundering and destroying private property .

		The power is now taken out of my hands , and I am not consulted , nor have I a voice in any matters .

		There is here at present near one hundred men , who are in the greatest confusion and anarchy , destroying and plundering private property , committing every enormity , and paying no attention to public service .

		The party I advised were gone to Crown Point , are returned , having met with head winds , and that expedition , and taking the sloop , -LRB- mounted with six guns , -RRB- is entirely laid aside .

		There is not the least regularity among the Troops , but every thing is governed by whim and caprice ; the soldiers threatening to leave the garrison on the least affront .

		Most of them must return home soon , as their families are suffering .

		Under our present situation , I believe one hundred men would retake the Fortress , and there seems no prospect of things being in a better situation .

		I have therefore thought proper to send an express , advising you of the state of affairs , not doubting you will take the matter into your serious consideration , and order a number of Troops to join those I have coming on here , or that you will appoint some other person to take the conrmand of them and this place , as you shall think most proper .

		Colonel
Allen	PERSON	is a proper man to head his own wild people , but entirely unacquainted with military service ; and as I am the only person who has been legally authorized to take possession of this place , I am determined to insist on my right , and I think it my duty to remain here against all opposition , until I have further orders .

		I can not comply with your orders in regard to the cannon , & c. , for want of men .

		I have wrote to the Governbur and
General Assembly of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	, advising them of my appointment , and giving them an exact detail of matters as they stand at present .

		I should be extremely glad to be honourably acquitted of my commission and that a proper person might be appointed in my room .

		But as I have , in consequence of my orders from you , gentlemen , been the first person who entered and took possession of the
Fort	LOCATION	, I shall keep it , at every hazard , until I have further advice and orders from you and the
General Assembly of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have the honour to be , gentlemen -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	.

		P.S. .

		It is impossible to advise you how many cannon are here and at
Crown Point	LOCATION	, as many of them are buried in the ruins .

		There is a large number of iron , and some brass , and mortars , & c. , lying on the edge of the
Lake	LOCATION	, which , as the
Lake	LOCATION	is high , are covered with water .

		The confusion we have been in has prevented my getting proper information , further than that there are many cannon , shells , mortars , & c. which may be very serviceable to our Army at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		COLONEL
ETHAN ALLEN	PERSON	TO THE MASSACHUSETTS PROVINCIAL CONGRESS 1 Gentlemen :
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, May 11 , 1775 .

		I have to inform you with pleasure unfelt before , that on break of day of the tenth of May , 1775 , by the order of the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	of the
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	, took the Fortress of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	by storm .

		The soldiery was composed of about one hundred Green Mountain Boys , and near fifty veteran soldiers from the Province of
Massachusetts-Bay	LOCATION	.

		The latter was under the command of Colonel
James Easton	PERSON	, who behaved with great zeal and fortitude , not only in council , but in the assault .

		The soldiery behaved with such resistless fury , that they so terrified the King 's Troops that they durst not fire on their assailants , and our soldiery was agreeably disappointed .

		The soldiery behaved with uncommon rancour when they leaped into the Fort ; and it must be confessed that the Colonel has greatly contributed to the taking of that Fortress , as well as
John Brown	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, Attorney at
Law	PERSON	, who was also an able counsellor , and was personally in the attack .

		I expect the Colonies will maintain this Fort .

		As to the cannon and warlike stores , I hope they may serve the cause of liberty instead of tyranny , and I humbly implore your assistance in immediately assisting the
Government of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	in establishing a garrison in the reduced premises .

		Colonel
Easton	PERSON	will inform you at large .

		From , gentlemen , -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Ethan Allen	PERSON	.

		To the Honourable Congress of the Province of the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	, or
Council of War	ORGANIZATION	.

		COLONEL
ETHAN ALLEN	PERSON	TO THE COMMITTEE OF THE CITY OF
ALBANY	ORGANIZATION	1 Gentlemen :
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, May 11 , 1775 .

		I have the inexpressible satisfaction to acquaint you that at day-break of the tenth instant , pursuant to my directions from sundry leading Gentlemen of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	and
Connecticut	LOCATION	, I took the fortress of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, with about one hundred and thirty
Green Mountain Boys	ORGANIZATION	.

		Colonel
-LSB- James -RSB- Easton	PERSON	with about forty-seven valiant soldiers , distinguished themselves in the action .

		Colonel
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	entered the fortress with me side by side .

		The guard was so surprised , that contrary to expectation they did not fire on us , but fled with precipitancy .

		We immediately entered the fortress and took the garrison prisoners , without bloodshed , or any opposition .

		They consisted of one Captain , and a Lieutenant and forty two men .

		Little more need be said .

		You know Governour -LSB- Guy -RSB-
Carleton	PERSON	of
Canada	LOCATION	will exert himself to retake it ; and as your County is nearer than any other part of the Colonies , and as your inhabitants have thoroughly manifested their zeal in c the cause of their Country , I expect immediate assistance from you both in men and provisions .

		You can not exert yourself too much in so glorious a cause .

		The number of men need be more at first , till the other Colonies can have time to muster .

		I am apprehensive of a sudden and quick attack .

		Pray be quick to our relief , and send us five hundred men immediately ー fail not .

		From your friend -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Ethan Allen Abraham Yates	PERSON	, Chairman of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	,

		EDWARD MOTT TO THE MASSACHUSETTS PROVINCIAL CONGRESS 1 Gentlemen :
Shoreham	LOCATION	, May 11 , 1775 I would congratulate you on the surrender of the
Garrison of Ticonderoga	LOCATION	to the
American Forces	ORGANIZATION	.

		The affair was planned and conducted after the following manner .

		A number of the principal gentlemen of the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	at
Hartford	LOCATION	, on Friday , the twenty-eighth of April , conversing on the distressed condition of the people of
Boston	LOCATION	, and the means necessary to relieve them , fell on the scheme to take that
Fortress	ORGANIZATION	, that we might have the advantage of the Cannon that were there , to relieve the people of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I told the gentlemen that in my opinion it might be taken by surprise with a few men if properly conducted .

		On which they desired me , if I was willing to serve my Country in that way , to joint Captain
Noah Phelps	PERSON	of
Simsbury	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Bernard Romans	PERSON	, on that design , and furnished us with three hundred Pounds in cash , from the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, and desired us to go forward to the upper Towns , and search into the situation of said
Garrison	PERSON	, and , if I thought proper , to proceed to take possession of the same .

		On which we collected to the number of sixteen men in
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and proceeded forward till we came to Colonel -LSB-
James -RSB- Easton	PERSON	's , at
Pittsfield	LOCATION	, and ther consulted with Colonel
Easton	PERSON	and
John Brown	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, who , after they heard our plan of operation agreed to join us ; and , after informing them that we intended raising our men on the -LSB-
New Hampshire	LOCATION	-RSB- Grants for the aforesaid purpose , as it would be difficult to raise and march a number of men through the country any distance , without our plans being discovered , Colonel
Easton	PERSON	and Mr.
Brown	PERSON	told us that the people on the Grants were poor , and at this time of year it would be difficult to raise a sufficient number of men there to take and hold said
Garrison	PERSON	, whereupon Colonel
Easton	PERSON	offered to raise men in his own Regiment for the aforesaid purpose , to join with the
Green Mountain Boys	ORGANIZATION	.

		2 On which I set out with him for the Town of
Jericho	LOCATION	, where Colonel
Easton	PERSON	raised between forty and fifty men , and proceeded to
Bennington	LOCATION	, at which place the men arrived the next day .

		At which place a Council of War was called , Colonel
Easton	PERSON	being Chairman , it was voted that Colonel
-LSB- Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	should send forward parties to secure the roads to the northward to prevent all intelligence from arriving before us .

		On Sunday evening , the seventh of this instant , we arrived at
Castleton	LOCATION	, where , the next day , was held a Council of War by a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	chosen for that purpose , of which
Committee	ORGANIZATION	I have the honour to be Chairman .

		After debating and consulting on different methods of procedure in order to accomplish our designs , it was concluded and voted that we would proceed in the following manner , viz : That a party of thirty men , under the command of Captain
Herrick	PERSON	, should , on the next day , in the afternoon , proceed to
Skenesborough	LOCATION	, and take into custody Major -LSB-
Philip -RSB- Skene	PERSON	and his party , and take possession of all the boats that they should find there , and in the night proceed up the
Lake	LOCATION	to
Shoreham	LOCATION	, with the remainder of our men , which was about one hundred and forty , who were under the command of Colonel
Ethan Allen	PERSON	, and Colonel
James Easton	PERSON	was his second , and Captain -LSB-
Seth	PERSON	-RSB-
Warner	ORGANIZATION	the third in command ; as these three men were the persons who raised the men , they were chosen to command , and to rank according to the number of men that each one raised .

		We also sent off Captain -LSB- Asa -RSB-
Douglass	PERSON	, of
Jericho	LOCATION	, to proceed directly to
Panton	PERSON	, and there consult his brother-in-law who lived there , and send down some boats to
Shoreham	LOCATION	, if possible , to help our people over to the Fort .

		All this was concluded should be done , or attempted and voted universally .

		After this affair was all settled , and the men pitched on to go in each party , all were preparing for their march , being then within about nine miles of
Skenesborough	LOCATION	, and about twenty-five miles , the way we went , from
Ticonderoga	PERSON	.

		Colonel
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	arrived to us from you with his orders .

		We were extremely rejoiced to see that you fully agreed with us as to the expediency and importance of taking possession of those garrisons , but were shockingly surprised when Colonel
Arnold	PERSON	presumed to contend for the command of those forces that we had raised , who we had assured should go under the command of their own officers , and be paid and maintained by the
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	.

		But Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	, after we had generously told him our whole plan , strenuously contended and insisted that he had a right to command them and all their officers , which bred such a mutiny among the soldiers which had nearly frustrated our whole design , as our men were for clubbing their fire-locks and marching home , but were prevented by Colonel
Allen	PERSON	and Colonel
Easton	PERSON	, who told them that he should not take the command of them , and if he had , their pay would be the same as though they were under their command ; but they would damn the pay , and say they would not be commanded by any others but those they engaged with ; and after the
Garrison	PERSON	was surrendered , Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	again assumed the command of the
Garrison	PERSON	, although he had not one man there , and demanded it of Colonel
Allen	PERSON	, on which we gave Colonel
Allen	PERSON	his orders in writing , as follows , viz. To Colonel
Ethan Allen	PERSON	, Sir , Whereas agreeable to the power and authority to us given by the
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	, we have appointed you to take the command of a party of men , and reduce and take possession of the
Garrison	PERSON	at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, and the dependencies thereto belonging , and as you are now in actual pos session of the same , you are hereby required to keep the command and posses sion of the same , for the use of the American Colonies , until you have further orders from the
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	, or the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Signed by order of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of War ,
Edward Mott	PERSON	, Chairman .

		Colonel
James Easton	PERSON	was of great service both in council and action , and in raising men for the above expedition , and appeared to be well qualified to be not only a Colonel of the Militia at home , but to command in the field .

		And also
John Brown	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, of
Pittsfield	LOCATION	, we recommend as an able counsellor , and full of spirit and resolution , as well as good conduct ; wish they may both be employed in the service of their ' Country equal to their merit .

		I have the pleasure to add , that on Wednesday morning last , the tenth of this instant about the break of day , our men entered the gate , till when they were undiscovered , and in the most courageous and intrepid manner darted like lightning upon the guards , so that but two had time to snap their fire-locks at us , and in a few minutes the Fortress , with its dependencies were delivered into our hands .

		There are about forty soldiers taken prisoners of war , including Officers , and excluding those taken at
Skenesborough	LOCATION	.

		Not one life lost in these noble acquisitions .

		I am , Gentlemen , in haste -LSB- & c. -RSB-

Falmouth	LOCATION	, for its arrogance in sending a message to
Thompson	PERSON	last week , to dissuade him from coming to take the ships .

Connecticut	LOCATION	, on their intended attack against
Ticonderoga	PERSON	, & c. and it is to our great regret that we have hitherto received no answer , although we pressed it , and have since wrote to you on the subject , by Colonel
-LSB- Philip -RSB- Schuyler	PERSON	, since which timefrequent applications have been made to us on the same subject ; and as we are unacquainted with the sentiments of our Colony on this very important enterprise , we have declined interfering We have just now received the original of the enclosed copy ; 2 by its contents you will see that they have succeeded in surprising
Ticonderoga	PERSON	, and that a requisition is made for men and provisions in order to enable them to repair and hold that fortress .

		Mr.
-LSB- John -RSB- Brown	PERSON	, who was personally in the action , brought the letter , and made the demand , says , that the prisoners were on their way to this City ; but that unless they are immediately assisted , they are afraid they will be obliged to abandon the fort , and leave the artillery behind , of which there are about two hundred pieces , great and small .

		He is dissatisfied with our answers , and went away abruptly , though we told him the circumstances we were in , and that we would immediately despatch an express to you .

		We hope you will no longer keep us in suspense .

		As the Troops in
Canada	LOCATION	will probably endeavour to retake it , the consequence of this enterprise will probably involve the northern parts of this Colony in the horrours of war and devastation , and therefore we earnestly call on you furnish us with your advice in this alarming crisis , immediately by Captain

Williamsburg	LOCATION	, May 12 .

		This day , about two o'clock , the Right Hon. the Countess of
Dunmore	PERSON	, with the rest of the Governor 's family , who have for some time past been on board the
Fowey	LOCATION	man of war , arrived at the palace in this city , to the great joy of the inhabitants , and , we make no doubt , of the whole country , who have the most unfeigned regard for her Ladyship , and wish her long to live amongst us .


JAMES MILLER	PERSON	TO
ALEXANDER PURDIE	PERSON	1 Mr.
Purdie	PERSON	,
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, May 12 , 1775 It is an unpardonable crime in any man wantonly to rob his neighbour of his fortune and reputation , by a partial representation of facts .

		2 Your correspondent should have informed the publick that Mr.
-LSB- Samuel	PERSON	-RSB- Gist is principal owner of the ship
Mary	PERSON	, and has the sole management of her himself ; that he built her to accommodate his friends in
Virginia	LOCATION	with freight , in a good stout vessel ; and that the small part Mr. -LSB-
John -RSB- Wilkinson	PERSON	has in her was intended to promote that end , by his superintending the building of her in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	, where he resides .

		I hope the impartial publick will consider that Mr.
Wilkinson	PERSON	's political principles did not appear at the time Mr.
Gist	PERSON	became connected with him , that , in short , they do not now appear , as it is notorious that when ships are wanted for government service the King does not ask merchants whether they are willing or not to let them .

		If Mr.
Wilkinson	PERSON	has voluntarily transgressed , I can pledge myself for Mr.
Gist	PERSON	that he will resent it in such manner as is most agreeable to the Americans , and will conduce the most to promote the glorious cause in which they are embarked : His connexions with , and the obligations he is under to
Virginia	LOCATION	are well known , and he is very ready to acknowledge them .

		Several Gentlemen , who are just arrived from
England	LOCATION	, can testify that he proved himself a zealous friend to American liberty on a late important occasion .

		The querist is respectfully acquainted , that it is possible to serve a friend without injuring the innocent .

		I am , Mr.
Purdie	PERSON	, your 's , the publick 's , and especially Mr.
Gist	PERSON	's friends , obedient humble servant , and , whenever it is requisite they shall be waited upon in person , by
James Miller	PERSON	3 1 .

ADMIRALTY	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	13 May 1775 My last Letter to you dated April 22d went by Lieut. -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Nunn	PERSON	in a Brig from
Salem	LOCATION	.

		Lieut. -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Graves	PERSON	in the
Diana	PERSON	is returned : I inclose a List of the Cannon and Ordnance he brought from the Fort at
Penobscot	LOCATION	.

		I have since employed the
Diana	PERSON	cruizing between
Cape Ann	LOCATION	and
Cape Cod	LOCATION	.

		I transmit Copies of a Memorial to Lieut. -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Mowat Commander of the Canceaux	PERSON	, and of his Letter to me : from these Accounts and from the representations of the Commissioners of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	also inclosed , I find myself obliged to let the Canceaux remain at
Falmouth	LOCATION	until I can send some other Vessel to relieve her .

		The Falcon sailed the 30th of April with Orders to go to -LSB-
Martha	PERSON	's -RSB- Vineyard and seize a Cargo of Flour , then to proceed to
Elizabeth Islands	LOCATION	to prevent a considerable Number of black Cattle and Sheep from being carried off .

		Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Linzee	PERSON	has just informed me that there is about 1500 Sheep on these
Islands	LOCATION	, with a few Cows , and that from their Vicinity to the Main , it is not possible to hinder the Stock being taken off .

		The Ship with the flour was not at the Vineyard .

		The Tartar still remains at
Halifax	LOCATION	for the security of that Yard and the
Kings Stores	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Lively continued at
Marblehead	LOCATION	raising Seamen and protecting the trade of those who are not in rebellion .

		I will send a Sloop to
Georgia	LOCATION	whenever one can be spared from the immediate and pressing services of this province .

		The Action of the 19th of April , falsely represented thro ' the Continent as begun by the
Kings Troops	ORGANIZATION	, has furnished a pretence for the seditious and disaffected -LRB- before too much disposed to Rebellion to appear in arms ; they are absolutely so throughout the four provinces , and the
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	sent me by Captains -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	and
James Montagu	PERSON	of the proceedings at
New York	LOCATION	-LRB- Copies of which are inclosed -RRB- fully satisfying me of the necessity of sending thither a Ship of force I ordered the
Asia	LOCATION	, but the prevailing Easterly winds kept her from getting out of this Harbour until the 8th instant .

		Since my Letter of the 23d was written we have had repeated Information of the Rebels Design to surprise Castle
William	PERSON	; I suppose to destroy the Magazines there .

		The
Asia	LOCATION	,
Otter Sloop	ORGANIZATION	, and Hope Schooner have been employed entirely to prevent such an Attack , and upon the departure of the
Asia	LOCATION	I ordered the
Boyne	LOCATION	to take her place .

		Reports are also spread that flat bottomed Boats are constructing up the
Rivers	PERSON	, and at several places in the Neighbourhood , to be brought by Land to those Rivers , from whence the Rebels are to attack
Boston	LOCATION	and the Shipping ; though these Schemes are scarcely practicable yet we are guarded against every possible Surprize .

		Our Boats rowing Guard have often been fired at from the Shore , but I have given the Captains of his Majesty 's Ships and Vessels Orders not to fire again upon any Account unless they are absolutely attacked , and some one wounded or Killed ; and then only to drive away the Rebels without pursuing ; being extremely loath -LRB- however difficult from repeated provocations to forbear -RRB- to commence hostilities by sea without the justest Reason , until I can be honoured with their Lordships Commands on this important Subject .

		I shall continue to give every support in my power to his Majesty 's Governors of Provinces , upon their requisition , for the protection of the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	faithful Subjects and their property , and for the security of lawful Commerce .

		I transmit for their Lordships Information various Intelligence I have received from Captain
Wallace	PERSON	of his Majesty 's ship Rose .

		In a Letter of the 26th April Captain
Wallace	PERSON	informs me that some frieds of Government have been very industrious to bring the town of
Newport	LOCATION	over to the King , and were they sure of constant support they flatter themselves with succeeding ; but what reliance !

		at present they are in terror of the Kings Ships .

		However I submit to their Lordships consideration the Importance of such a Post .

		Possession of this place would cut off any Supplies that could be sent from the Southern to the
Northern Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, and it appears to me from its Situation of such great consequence that I most heartily wish it was established as a
Kings Post	ORGANIZATION	and fortified accordingly : In the mean time I shall add a Sloop of War or a Schooner to the Service Captain
Wallace	PERSON	is employed in .

		All communication by Land is entirely stopped : General -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	has represented to me the necessity for having small Vessels to carry dispatches to and from
New York	LOCATION	, and occasionally to
Piscataqua	LOCATION	and
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		I have acquainted the Governor that a Vessel shall be ready to depart with Dispatches on the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	whenever his Excellency pleases .

		I have hired one Sloop for this purpose and shall provide as many as the necessity of the times require and I can procure .

		I am & c.

		The Fears of a few well disposed people to risk their Vessels , and the determination of the rest to prevent the

		It was with great difficulty I could purchase the two Schooners I have got , for under the severe prohibition of the Rebel Generals few people dare to supply us .

JEDIDIAH PREBLE	PERSON	TO MASSACHUSETTS PROVINCIAL
CONGRESS	ORGANIZATION	1 Hond Sir
Falmo	PERSON	14th May 1775 the
Committee of Corespdce	ORGANIZATION	in this Town beg leave to inform you that Some Time past we received Advice from
George Town	PERSON	, that Col : -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Thompson	PERSON	was fitting two Vessels there , with Design to attempt the taking the Kings Ship Canceaux stationed in this Harbour commanded by Capt -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Mowat	PERSON	, a Gentleman , whose Conduct since he has been here , has given no Grounds of Suspicion , he had any Design to distress or injure us ; but on the other hand he has afforded his Assistance to sundry Vessels in Distress .

		We thought such an Attempt had the Appearance of laying a Foundation for the Destruction of this Town , the
Comittee of Correspondence met &	ORGANIZATION	wrote to the
Comittee of Correspondence at George Town	ORGANIZATION	desiring they would prevent their Coming ; we also wrote to Col :
Thompson	PERSON	, desiring him to desist from such an attempt , as it would through the Town into the greatest Confusion imaginable : we sent an Express , & received his Answer , that he had dropt the Design of Comingー But , on Monday night -LSB- May 8 -RSB- he landed upwards of Sixty Men , on the Back side of a Neck of Land joyning to the Town , who came there in a Number of Boats , & lay undiscovered till about the middle of the Next Day ; at which Time ,
Capt Mowat	PERSON	, the Doctor of the Ship ,
& Parson	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
John -RSB- Wiswall	PERSON	, were taking a Walk on said Neck , when a Detachment from Col :
Thompson	PERSON	's
Party	ORGANIZATION	rushed from their Concealment , surrounded the Gentlemen , & made them Prisoners , & conducted them to the Colonel , who was with the main Body , on the back Side of the Neck .

		Capt.
Hog	PERSON	, who now commanded the Ship , immediately clapped Springs on his Cables .

		She laying within
Musket Shott	PERSON	of the Town , & swore if the Gentlemen were not Releas 'd by Six o'Clock , he would fire on the Town .

		He fired two Cannon , & although there were no
Shott	PERSON	in them , it frightened the Women & Children to such a Degree , that some crawled under wharves ; some ran down Cellar , & some out of Town .

		Such a Shocking Scene was never before presented to View here ー The Gentlemen who were in custody were conducted to a publick
House	ORGANIZATION	Where
Capt Mowat	PERSON	declared , if he was not released it would be the Destruction of the Town .

		Every Gentleman present used their Utmost Endeavours to accomodate the Matter .

		Col :
Thompson	PERSON	consented that a Comittee should be chosen , consisting of Officers from his
Party	ORGANIZATION	and Gentlemen from the Town , to consult in what manner the affair could be accomodated ; but , as it was late , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	chose to refer the Consideration of it till next Morning .

		Capt.
Mowat	PERSON	then requested , he might go on Board his Ship that night & he would pawn his Word & Honour that he would return next Morning , at what Time , and at what place should be appointed .


Coll	PERSON	.


Thompson	PERSON	consented , provided
Coll	PERSON	-LSB-
Enoch -RSB- Freeman	PERSON	& Brigadier
Preble	PERSON	would pass their Words , that the several Gentlemen should return according to their Promise , & also pawn their Word & Honour , if the Gentlemen fail 'd of coming , that they would deliver themselves up , & stand by the Consequences , which was consented to .


Capt Mowatt	PERSON	not coming according to his Promise , which was to have been at Nine o Clock the next Morning , the Sponsors appeared according to Promise , & were confined .


Capt Mowatt	PERSON	wrote to them , & let them know he had fully determined to have comply 'd with his promise , but he had sent his man on Shoar to carry some dirty Linen to his washing Woman & to bring of -LSB- f -RSB- some clean : that said man made Oath , that two of the Body under Arms , one of which , swore by all that was sacred , the moment he came on Shore he should have what was in his Piece , and the other , that he should never return on Board again with his Life : & that two more of his men made Oath , they heard several of the Men under Arms say , the moment he came on Shore they would have his Life ; this was what he wrote to plead an Excuse for not complying with his promise .


Coll	PERSON	.


Thompson	PERSON	told the two Gentlemen under Confinement , that he must have some Provision & Refreshment for his men , which they procured to the Amount of thirteen or fourteen Pounds Money ; on which they were dismised .

		ー about ten o'Clock , he sent an Account to them for Time & Expense , amounting to # 158.18 M. and gave them till next morning , nine o Clock to return an Answer ; which they did , in the Negative , He said he would have Satisfaction before he left
Town	ORGANIZATION	.

		He then seized all the Goods he could find belonging to Capt. -LSB-

		They also carried off one Boat belonging to
Coulson	PERSON	, & one other to Capt Mowatt ; they also obliged Capt -LSB-

		MEMORIAL OF

JOHN MURRAY	PERSON	TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS 1 To the Honble the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	now Sitting at
Philadelphia The Memorial	LOCATION	of
Robert Murray	PERSON	and
John Murray	PERSON	of the City of
New York	LOCATION	Merchants Humbly Sheweth That the Memorialists being owners of the Ship Dutchess of
Gordon	PERSON	and expecting She would be in
London	LOCATION	by the time their orders could arrive there did , on the 7th of September last by a letter to
Philip Sansom	PERSON	direct him to put certain Articles on Board the said Ship on account of the Memorialists together with what Freight he could procure for her , and to dispatch her immediately for
New York	LOCATION	, as may appear by an Extract of the Letter hereunto annexed marked No 1 .

		That the
Memorialists	LOCATION	so far from Entertaining any Design to Counteract the measures recommended by the late
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	did as soon as they were informed thereof , Countermand the abovementioned order except as to such goods , as might in Consequence thereof have actually become the property of the Memorialists and their Partner the said
Philip Sansom	PERSON	for the truth of which they beg leave to Refer to the annexed Extract of a letter to the said
Philip Sansom	PERSON	Dated the 5th of October 1774 mark 'd No 2 .

		That in pursuance of the above Directions there were Shipped on Board the Buelah -LRB- a Vessel belonging to Memorialists -RRB- at
London	LOCATION	Sundry Goods on account of the Memorialists and their Partner with which Goods the said vessel Sail 'd for
New York	LOCATION	on the 5th or 6th Day of December last and arrived there the 16th or 17th Day of February following .

		That on the arrival of the said Vessel and Cargo which happened after the time limited by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for the continuance of our Importation , the Memorialists having no Intention to Land their goods contrary to the Terms of the -LSB-
Continental -RSB- Association	ORGANIZATION	would have cheerfully submitted to what they conceived to be the Spirit and Design thereof and were therefore willing and did offer to unload their Cargo and Ship it in another Bottom under the Inspection of some of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	here and to send it to some place not within the Restriction imposed by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the Memorialists beg Leave to Refer to the annexed Copy of their Letter sent to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	upon this Subject marked No 3 containing more at large their proposal and the Reasons on which it was founded .

		The Memorialists beg leave further to observe that they did really believe their Constructicn of this part of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	was consistent with the
Spirit	ORGANIZATION	and Design thereof and had the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	here been of that opinion such a Mode of Compliance would have greatly alleviated the Loss of the Memorialists as they might in that Case have Shipped their Cargo away in a small vessel instead of sending it in a vessel not above 1/3 full .

		That reduced as they thought to an unnecessary hardship & chagrined with the Disappointment The Memorialists rashly formed the Design of Secretly Landing some small part of the Cargo and were so imprudent as to carry the same into Execution .

		That before a discovery was made thereof and at a time when the Memorialists had great reasons to suppose the place where the Goods were deposited would not be discovered to wit the 13th March last they made a Declaration of the Fact and offered to give the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	a full account of the particulars on Oath which they accordingly did on the 15th of the same Month , when all the Goods Landed had been delivered up to the
Committee of Elizabeth Town	ORGANIZATION	and the Disposition thereof submitted entirely to the Directions of the committee at
New York	LOCATION	all which particulars will more fully appear from -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB-
Holt	PERSON	's
New York Journal	ORGANIZATION	of the 23d March hereunto also annexed to which the Memorialists refer .

		The Memorialists having proceeded thus far and manifested their Intention to satisfie the public in any reasonable way that could be expected as well as to Express their Contrition for the hasty and imprudent measure they had taken , and to prevent their future
Commercial Intercourse	ORGANIZATION	with others from becoming the means of other Infractions of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Memorialists did Shut up their Store , discontinue all Trade , Shut up their own Goods under the Seals of certain Persons here Transferred their
Commission Business	ORGANIZATION	to others and gave up their Wharfs as free for the use of the Navigation of the City untill , they should be relieved in the premises by the Interposition of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, as Vouchers of these Facts the Memorialists refer to the annexed printed publications marked No 5 & No 6 .

		The foregoing is a true State of the Facts relative to this unhappy affair in which the Memorialists are involved and as their Commercial Concerns were large and extensive at least amounting to # 50,000 per annum this total dereliction of Business has become an immense Loss to them and if unrelieved can not but terminate in their Ruin .

		That Mr
Philip Sansom	PERSON	their Partner who has been distinguished for his warm attachment to American Liberty tho not concern 'd in the indiscreet Step taken by the Memorialists is yet involved in all its fatal Consequences That besids the weight of Distress and Sufferings to which the Memorialists themselves have been exposed not only from their great Loss but the Resentment of an incensed People their present Scituation must be attended with a train of Evils to the Innocent who are connected with them in Business .

		Their Creditors must suffer Those who depend on their large
Commercial Business for Bread	ORGANIZATION	are turned out of Employ and the Public deprived of the advantages which necessarily flow from a continuance of their
Trade and Commerce	ORGANIZATION	.

		That the Memorialists presume the American
Congress	ORGANIZATION	from the great and important ends of their Convention will move only on Public principles and therefore think it improper to address their tender and benevolent feelings not doubting but every generous and humane sentiment towards the Memorialists which is consistent with the public good will have their due influence in a determination of this Subject in which the Memorialists are so deeply interested .

		Permit them then to hope that this August and respectable Body , from a consieration of the Conduct of the Memorialists in this affair from their most earnest endeavours to atone in some measure for their indiscretion from the great and Complicated Distress they have already sustained , from the Circumstance that the Innocent are deeply involved in their sufferings , and that a continuation of their sufferings can only perpetuate their Calamities without advancing the important Ends of public Safety , will in their Wisdom reinstate the Memorialists in their Scituation with respect to their Commercial Priviledges .

ADMIRALTY	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir ,
Preston Boston	PERSON	15th May 1775 I have this moment by the Fowey 's Tender received a Letter from Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, a Copy of which I inclose ; I would readily send a two decked ship to
Virginia	LOCATION	, but the preservation of this post and perhaps the whole Army here depends upon the
Naval Force	ORGANIZATION	in this Harbour .

		I therefore can not in the present State of Affairs send any more of the Capital Ships from hence ; indeed the
Somerset	LOCATION	is unfit to go , for notwithstanding her sheathing has been stripped off six Streaks and so much of her Bottom caulked , yet she makes the same quantity of water as before , and must therefor go to
Halifax	LOCATION	this Summer if possible .

		Captain
-LSB- George -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	of the Fowey informs me that the Contractor for supplying the King 's Ships at
Virginia	LOCATION	with Provisions is forbid by the people to send any more , so what he now procured must be by
Stealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		I expect Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Linzee of the Falcon	PERSON	to arrive every hour with the Ship Champion ; she has on board Eight hundred Barrels of Flour and some Corn intended for the
Rebel Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have given Orders to secure and bring to
Boston	LOCATION	all Vessels with Provisions agreeable to the Governor 's request of Yesterday , a Copy of which I inclose , And we have written to the Governors of
Quebec	LOCATION	and
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	to facilitate the sending Supplies of fresh provisions and necessaries to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		We hope in a short time to have sufficient for the sick ; but it is forbidden under pain of death by the Rebels at
Cambridge	LOCATION	to supply the Town of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Two Transports with Marines came in Yesterday , a Signal is now out for more , I hope they will be by Tomorrow .

		From what can be learned it is not found that one Province is in a better Situation than another , the People called Friends of Government are few in all , and those Moderate Men , who abhor violent Proceedings and wish for Peace and quiet ; the opposite Party numerous , active and violent .

		Two hundred and twenty Six Marines with their Officers under the Command of Major

Williamsburg	LOCATION	15th May 1775 My Lord The Commotion in this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, of the Cause of which I gave your Lordship an Account in my letter No 26 dated the 1st of May , has obliged me to Shut myself in , and make a Garrison of my house , expecting every moment to be attacked .

		There is scarce a County of the whole
Colony	ORGANIZATION	wherein part of the People have not taken up Arms and declared their intention of forcing me to make restitution of the Powder ; bodies of different Numbers have been in Motion in all parts of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, who have been only dissuaded from pursuing their attempts by the interposition of Some less violent People , and Compelled to lay down their Arms and atone for their offences by the Justice of the Country or the Support due from Subjects to their lawfull Government .

		A
Party	ORGANIZATION	headed by a Certain
Patrick Henry	PERSON	, one of the Delegates of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, a Man of desperate Circumstances , and one who has been very active in encouraging disobedience and exciting a Spirit of revolt among the People for many years past , Advanced to within a few Miles of this Place , and there encamped with all the appearances of actual War , Stoping and detaining every passenger on the road coming this way for fear of my obtaining intelligence of their motions ;
Henry	PERSON	, their leader dispatching letters all over the Country to excite the People to Join him ; and he Sent one particularly to direct that the People of the County of
York	LOCATION	should prevent , at all events , any Succour being Sent to me from the Man of War lying at
York	LOCATION	or my retreat to the Man of War .

		While they were in this position they found means , by threatning the person family and
Property of His Majesty	PERSON	's Receiver General , Mr -LSB-
Richard -RSB- Corbin	PERSON	, to extort the Sum of # 300 , from him which they thought proper to demand out of the Kings Revenue to replace the Powder which I had removed out of the Magazine , having obtained this they have declared themselves Satisfied and Justice done to the Country for the Insult I had Committed , and have returned triumphantly to their respective habitations ... I transmit to your Lordship two Proclamations which I have issued on this occasion ; the first of which I thought proper to publish together with the
Minute of Council	ORGANIZATION	, in hopes the names of the Gentlemen who advised it , from their Credit with the People , might induce those who have Joined in Such dangerous Measures from ignorance , to pay the greater attention to the warning it contained ... ever in the Place where I live Drums are beating and Men in uniform dresses with Arms are continually in the Streets , which my
Authority	ORGANIZATION	is no longer able to prevent , your Lordship will I hope See the Necessity of Sending me Instructions upon the occasion , and of putting me in a Situation of Safety .

		p. Le Despenser You will have heard before this reaches you of the `` actual commencement of Hostilities '' in
New England	LOCATION	against the Inhabitants by the Kings Troops & more particulars of the Action of the 19th April than we yet know of in this Country ー the
Associated Colonies	ORGANIZATION	have taken the alarm & but three days ago I put the Question `` is it your pleasure Gentlemen to agree with your Committee '' ?

		when the following association was Unanimously approved ofー `` The actual Commencement of Hostilities against this Continent ー the threats of arbitrary impositions from abroad ー & the dread of instigated Insurrections at home ー are causes Sufficient to drive an oppressed people to the use of Arms : We therefore the Subscribers , Inhabitants of this unhappy Colony holding ourselves bound by that most Sacred of all obligations , the duty of good Citizens towards an injured Country , & thoroughly convinced that under our present distressed circumstances we Shall be justified before God & Man in resisting force by force ; do unite our Selves under every tie of Religion & of honour & associate as a band in her defence against every Foe & we do Solemnly promise that whenever her
Continental	ORGANIZATION	or provincial Counsils Shall decree it necessary we will go forth & be ready to Sacrifice our Lives & fortunes in attempting to Secure her Freedom & Safety . ''

		ー This Association I Say was unanimously approved of in the
General Committee	ORGANIZATION	48 Members present ー it will be recommended to the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	at their first meeting on the first of June ー I have no doubt of a favourable reception there & believe it will be Subscribed to by the Inhabitants throughout this Colony ー in the mean time the daily & nightly Sound of Drums & Fifes discover a Spirit in the people to make all possible resistance against that arbitrary power complained of ー upwards of one hundred Men besides the common
Town Watch mount guard	ORGANIZATION	every Night & Committees of observation , of Intelligence & of Safety find employment every Day ー in a word the people are resolved to do all in their power to resist against the force & Stratagems of the British
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	ー & I find that even among those few who are Suspected of disaffection to the Americans , there are many & perhaps a Majority who will in the day of trial appear on the Side of the American Cause.ー 1 .

		`` EXTRACTS OF LETTERS FROM
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	TO GENTLEMEN IN
BALTIMORE	LOCATION	, MAY 16 , 1775 '' 1 On Sunday a ship , Capt.
Byrne	PERSON	, arrived here from
Liverpool	LOCATION	, which she left the 3d of April , and advised us of a ship ,
Jones	PERSON	, master , being loaded with salt and some dry goods , which would sail in a few days after him , for this port , and that the ship
Johnston	PERSON	, belonging to Mr.
Gildart	PERSON	of
Liverpool	LOCATION	, was loaded with salt and dry goods , by the house of Messrs.
Ashton	PERSON	, and bound to your port .

		You may daily look for your ship , as we do for ours ; we have already given directions to our pilots , & c. to watch her motions ... It is said , from good authority , that Mr.
Leister	PERSON	, of Pool , has 4 ships coming out to
America	LOCATION	, to load with bread & c. for
Newfoundland	LOCATION	; be careful that some of them dont load with you .

		If any of them comes here , I think they will hardly return .

		A vessel arrived yesterday from
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	, whose captain has brought a quantity of cheese , which he must carry back .

		He informs us that a ship was ballasting .

		with salt for this place , and one or two for yours .

		they will be taken care of and I hope your
Committee	ORGANIZATION	will take care of those going your way .

		A good lookout ought to be kept , that people acting knowingly , in direct opposition to our engagements , may not escape ; and it is well if these ships , on hearing how things are at your Capes , do not land their dry goods in some part of the bay .

		All goods on board should be taken possession of by the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, and indeed ship and all should be sent back ; the salt at least thrown into the sea , and the goods returned by the ship .

WILLIAM REYNOLDS	PERSON	TO

Virginia	LOCATION	May 16th 1775 My last was 6t April , since which I have recd your two favours of 6t
Jany	PERSON	and 28 Feby by which I am agreeably informed of the Insurance being made on my Tobo in the
Martin	PERSON	, I observe what you say relative to the
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		I can assure you that Affair has not given me a little concern , but am in hopes that your letter of Justification will satisfy every unprejudiced person .

		Your J H.N 's delaying the publication of it a week was productive of some other disagreeable resolves from Gloster as you will see in one of our Papers 2 tho ' I am informed that
Committee	ORGANIZATION	is now called to revoke them , there has a Query appeared in one of our papers whether Mr Gist 's Ship ought to have any
Tobo	PERSON	as one of the Owners Mr
Wilkinson	PERSON	had Charter 'd two of his Ships to bring Transports to
America	LOCATION	.

		3 You will no doubt ere this have heard of the unhappy Engagement that has hapned at
Concord	LOCATION	near
Boston	LOCATION	with 900 Provincials & 1800 Regulars in which Skirmish the Regulars retreated with the loss of 150 Men , 100 wounded & 20 more taken Prisoners , the Provincials only lost 43 Men .

		We have been a good deal alarmed in our little
Town	ORGANIZATION	4 &
Williamsburg	LOCATION	lately , by some impolitick & unwarrantable proceedings of our Governor & Capt -LSB-
George -RSB- Montague	PERSON	, of the Fowey who lays of -LSB- f -RSB- this Town .

		the latter wrote a letter to the President about ten days since informing him that he had information the Governor was to be attacked that morning in his Palace & therefore thought it necessary to send him assistance from his Ship & at the same time to inform the Inhabitants of
York	LOCATION	that if they were interupted in their March to
Williamsburg	LOCATION	or insulted on their Arrival there , he shou 'd be under the necessity of fireing on the Town 5 this Alarm occasioned poor old Mrs Light , & some other helpless Women & Children to leave the Town Our situation at present is exceedingly unhappy , & God knows when it will mend You dont mention any thing of Colo -LSB-

		I have lately shipt
Messrs Pasley 's & Co	ORGANIZATION	a Cargoe of Corn which I expect will sell for near # 400 sterling 6 I have directed them to remitt the Nett proceeds to you & shou 'd be glad you wou 'd pay # 100 thereof to Mr

		Inclosed you will receive a small draft of
Owen Williams	PERSON	on Mr Molleson for # 23.7.7 which you will please to receive Credit my Accot for the same .

ALEXANDER INNES	ORGANIZATION	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 My Lord ,
Charles Town	PERSON	, May 16 , 1775 I did myself the honor of writing You the 1st of this month , when I took the liberty of giving Your Lordship the best account in my power of the present state of this Province : every day 's experience convinces me more and more of the justice of the observations I then made , nor have I one word to retract of what I wrote .

		The Lieutenant Governor after adjourning the Assembly to the 1st of June , and calling a
Council	ORGANIZATION	to settle the ceremonial of the new Governor 's reception , retired into the Country .

		Every thing remained quiet here , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	continuing to sit with great Assiduity and secrecy , till the 5th instant , when they published a Letter to their Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	which Your Lordship will find in the News papers I enclose , and confirms my Account of the manner they received that conciliatory motion , which the Humanity and Tenderness of the King 's ministers alone dictated .

		2 A few days ago we had Accounts of an Action near
Boston	LOCATION	, but very confused , and carrying evident Marks of falsehood , and misrepresentation ; but as it can not at present be contradicted it has raised the spirit of the party most astonishingly , and nothing less is talked of than storming
Boston	LOCATION	, and totally destroying the British Troops .

		Violent resolutions have since been proposed in the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	here , but the moderate party have so far prevailed , that they seem now resolved to take no desperate steps till after the meeting of the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which they have appointed on the 1st of next month instead of the 20th ; but they declare on every occasion , that if any attempt is made to seize their Delegates , all the servants of Government here will be immediately secured as Hostages , and sent into the back country .

		It is said that as soon as the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	meets it will be proposed to raise 2000 men , which they mean to pay by voluntary Tax of a moidore 3 on each negroe .

		A Test and
Association	ORGANIZATION	is already framed , to be presented to every inhabitant in the Province , and those who refuse to sign it will be under a necessity of leaving the country .

		Some of the most moderate object to its being offered to the servants of Government , and will oppose that step in the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, but I should apprehend it will be carried against them , and if General -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	does not strike some successful blow within a few weeks , I have not a doubt but that there will be a total change of Government here , and the very slight mask they now condescend to wear entirely thrown off .

		A Letter has been read in their
Committee	ORGANIZATION	from a Mr.
-LSB- Arthur -RSB- Lee	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION	informing them that it had been proposed to Ministry to grant freedom to such Slaves as should desert their Masters and join the
King	ORGANIZATION	's troops ; this has raised a great ferment , and furnished the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	with a pretext to mount a Guard of 100 men every evening , with a Patrol of Horsemen .

		They had decency enough to send two of their body to the Chief Justice Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	, the eldest Councillor then in Town , not to ask his leave , but to acquaint him with their intentions ; for the Guard was ordered , and mounted that evening ; he immediately dispatched an Express to the Lieutenant Governor who came to Town next day , called a Council , and gave his Sanction to a measure which was taken without his privity .

		He immediately returned to his Retreat .

		At this Council Mr.
Barnard Elliot	PERSON	resigned his Seat at the Board , and Mr.
John Drayton	PERSON	it is said means to follow his Example .

		His son
William Henry Drayton	PERSON	is under suspension , and is one of the most virulent Incendarys in the Province , so that the
Council	ORGANIZATION	is reduced to Mr.
Skottowe	PERSON	the Secretary/Mr .


Gordon	PERSON	the Chief Justice/Mr .

		Irving the Receiver General/Mr .

		Gregory the Judge and/Mr .


William Bull Junior	PERSON	, a very young man indeed , who knows not as yet of his Appointment , but who I dare say will not accept the Honour intended him as he is strongly linked to the other party .

		In this situation My Lord little remains for the New Governor 4 to do but to guard against giving the Sanction of the little
Authority	ORGANIZATION	he possesses to the dangerous measures the people here are pursuing .

		Of the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	he must be particularly careful : they have a Tax
Bill	PERSON	now ready to present to the Council , which they know neither that
House	ORGANIZATION	nor the Governor can give their assent to ; for I have great reason to think the Original Bone of contention 1500 # to the Bill of Rights Society is in some way or other provided for in it , and I know there is another Article no less exceptionable viz a Grant of 3000 # sterling to the 8 Delegates now at the
General Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The moment this
Bill	PERSON	is rejected they will be prepared to open their Bank , and issue Certificates to what amount they please ; I shall therefore think it my duty strongly to recommend to His Excellency to be prepared to dissolve them before they have time to give their proceedings the least Colour of Legality .

		After this I see nothing His Lordship can do but to wait with patience to take the advantage of any change that may be produced by the success of his Majesty 's measures to the Northward , in the mean time giving all the Encouragement , and Countenance in his power to the friends of Government here , but Protection He can not afford them .

		I hope Your Lordship will not think me guilty of too much presumption if I beg leave with great submission to observe that two Regiments in this place under a proper Officer would prevent many rash and disagreeable Steps that will in all probability be taken .

		The situation of this Province between
Georgia	LOCATION	that has refused to join the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and
North Carolina	LOCATION	where there are many friends of Government , added to its great Opulence , renders some force much to be wished for ; and as things are come to such an extremity would tend greatly to promote His Majesty 's service .

		If even a couple of Frigates under the Command of a Spirited , Steady , Cool Officer were stationed in this harbour , the good effects of such a measure would soon be seen ; but the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Friends in this Province , -LRB- who are not a few if they durst appear -RRB- are in the lowest state of despondency , expecting every moment to be drove from their Occupations , and Homes , and plundered of all they have earned by the unremitted industry of many years .

		This is a Freedom my Lord which nothing but the warmest Zeal for the Service of my Sovereign and my Country could excuse : a freedom which this moment , in this place would cost me my Life were it known ; but when I had Your Lordship 's permission to write you on the state of
Carolina	LOCATION	, I was determined that while I conveyed assured facts , I would have no reserve in declaring my sentiments , flattering myself it would be the strongest proof I could give of the perfect Respect with which I have the Honor to be My Lord -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Alex	PERSON	:
Innes N.B. Although the Action	ORGANIZATION	near
Boston	LOCATION	happened the 19th of last month , except such an Account as Your Lordship will see in the Papers published under their own influence , not a tittle is known either in this or the neighbouring Provinces .

		Many gross and infamous flasehoods will therefore be daily circulated to the great discouragement of the Frien9s of Government , the deception of the Timid , and Unwary , and of course to the Detriment of the King 's Service ; nor can it be prevented but by regular intelligence from General
Gage	PERSON	by Sea .

		A Letter from
Edward Mott	PERSON	to this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, dated 11th May , 1775 , giving an account of the taking of the Fortress at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, was read , together with a Letter from
Ethan Allen	PERSON	.

		Also an application from Col.
-LSB- James -RSB- Easton	PERSON	and others ; whereupon , Ordered , That Colonel Foster , Mr.

Samuel -RSB- Holten	PERSON	, be a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to introduce Colonel
Easton	PERSON	to this
House	ORGANIZATION	, to give a narrative of that transaction , and that each Member have liberty to ask him any questions .

John -RSB- Taylor	PERSON	, Colonel Foster , Doctor -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Holten	PERSON	, and Mr.
Cross	PERSON	, be a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to take the same into consideration and report .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	appointed to consider the account of taking the Fortress of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, reported the following Resolve and Letter to the
Assembly of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	, which were accepted , and the Letter ordered to be authenticated and sent forward : Gentlemen : We have the happiness of presenting our congratulations to you on the reduction of that important fortress ,
Ticonderoga	PERSON	.

		We applaud the conduct of both the officers and soldiers , and are of opinion , that the advantageous situation of that fortress makes it highly expedient that it should be repaired , and properly garrisoned .

		In the mean time , as we suppose that there is no necessity for keeping all the cannon there , we should be extremely glad if all the battery cannon , especially brass cannon , which can be spared from that place , or procured from Crown Point -LRB- which we hope by this time is in the hands of our friends -RRB- , may be forwarded this way , with all possible expedition , as we have here to contend with an
Army	ORGANIZATION	furnished with as fine a train of artillery as ever was seen in
America	LOCATION	.

		And we are in extreme want of a sufficient number of cannon to fortify those important passes , without which we can neither annoy General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, if it should become necessary , nor defend ourselves against him .

		We therefore must earnestly recommend this very important matter to your immediate consideration ; and we would suggest it , as our opinion , that the appointing Colonel
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	to take charge of them , and bring them down , with all possible haste , may be a means of settling any disputes which may have arisen between him and some other officers , which we are always desirous to avoid , and more especially at a time when our common danger ought to unite us in the strongest bonds of unity and affection .

		We are , gentlemen , & c. This
Congress	ORGANIZATION	having received authentick intelligence that the Fort at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	is surrendered into the hands of Colonel
Ethan Allen	PERSON	and others , together with the
Artillery and Artillery Stores	ORGANIZATION	, Ammunition , & c. , thereunto belonging , for the benefit of these Colonies , occasioned by the intrepid valour of a number of men under the command of the said Colonel
Allen	PERSON	, Colonel
Easton	PERSON	of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and others ; and by the advice and direction of the Committee for that expedition , the said Colonel
Allen	PERSON	is to remain in possession of the same and its dependencies until further orders .

		Resolved , That this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	do highly approve of the same ; and the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	of the
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	are hereby desired to give directions relative to garrisoning and maintaining the same , for the future , until the advice of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	can be had in that behalf .

		And as this Colony is in want of some Battering Cannon for their defence immediately , it is further Resolved , That the President of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	be desired to write to the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	of the
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	, desiring that they would give order for the immediate removal of some of those Cannon to this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, for the purpose aforesaid .

NEW ENGLAND	LOCATION	CHRONICLE , THURSDAY , MAY 18 , 1775
Cambridge	LOCATION	, May 18 .

		Yesterday Colonel
-LSB- James -RSB- Easton	PERSON	arrived at the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
Watertown	LOCATION	from
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, & brings the glorious News of the taking that Place by the American forces , without the loss of a man ; Of which interesting Event we have collected the following Particulars , viz. Last Tuesday se ` nnight -LSB- May 9 -RSB- , about 240 Men , from
Connecticut	LOCATION	and this Province , under Col. -LSB-
Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	and
Colonel Easton	LOCATION	, arrived at the
Lake	LOCATION	near
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, 80 of them crossed it , and came to the Fort about the Dawn of day .

		The Sentry was much surprised at seeing such a Body of Men , & snapped his Piece at them ; our Men , however rushed forward , seized and confined the Sentry , pushed through the covered Way , and all got safe upon the Parade , while the Garrison were sleeping in their Beds .

		They immediately formed a hollow Square , and gave three Huzzas , which bro ' t out the
Garrison	PERSON	; and an inconsiderable Skirmish , with Cutlasses or Bayonets , ensued , in which a small Number of the Enemy received some Wounds .

		The commanding Officer soon came forth ; Col.
Easton	PERSON	clapped him upon the Shoulder , told him he was his Prisoner , and demanded , IN THE NAME OF
AMERICA	LOCATION	, an instant Surrender of the
Fort	LOCATION	, with all its Contents , to the
American Forces	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Officer was in great Confusion , and expressed himself to this Effect : Damn you , what ... .

		what ... .

		does all this mean ?

		... Col.
Easton	PERSON	again told him , that he and his Garrison were Prisoners : The Officer said , that he hoped he should be treated with honour .

		Colonel
Easton	PERSON	replied , he should be treated with much more Honour that our people had met with from the British Troops .

		The officer then said , he was all Submission , and immediately ordered his Soldiers to deliver up all the Arms , in Number about 100 Stands .

		As they gave up their Arms , the Prisoners were secured in the hollow square ... The American Forces having thus providentially got Possession of this important Fortress , found in it upwards of One Hundred Pieces of Cannon , several Mortars , and a considerable Quantity of shot ,
Stores	ORGANIZATION	, and some Powder .

		After this Acquisition , a Detachment of our Troops was despatched to take Possession of
Crown-Point	LOCATION	, where there is a considerable Number of Cannon .

		Another Detachment was sent to
Skenesborough	LOCATION	, where they took Major
-LSB- Philip -RSB- Skene	PERSON	and his Family , with a
Number of Soldiers	ORGANIZATION	, & several small Pieces of Cannon .

Congress	ORGANIZATION	have Received Information that the
Committee of Correspondence of the Town of Falmouth	ORGANIZATION	, on hearing that you were about making an attack on the Canceaux , Man of War , Lying in the harbour of that Town , desired you to forbear any proceedings of that kind ; which you promised to do ; but that you afterwards took the Captain of said Ship of War , and detained the Hon.

Enoch Freman Esqurs	PERSON	, as Hostages for the return of the said Captain : And that you Levied contributions of money and other things from the subjects there , And took a Boat belonging to the said
Canceaux	PERSON	.

		Though this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	approves of your general zeal for this Country , yet it appears , that your Conduct in taking the Captain of the Ship , against your promise , and your Levying money or other things of the People , is , by no means , justifiable : and it is therefore Expected that you attend the next
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that shall be held in this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and do your character justice in this matter , and that you return said Boat , and stay all further proceedings of this kind in the mean time .

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	1 Sir
Preston Boston May	PERSON	18th 1775 By Accounts from the best Authorities to the Southward I find that the Rebellion begun in the province of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	hath spread itself to the Colonies of
New York	LOCATION	,
Pensilvania	LOCATION	and
Virginia	LOCATION	: there is too much reason to apprehend the Infection is general , since even
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	has shewn Symptoms in burning a Quantity of
Hay	PERSON	collected for the use of the Kings Troops .

		I therefore beg leave to submit to their Lordships Consideration how extremely useful a few of the old Fifty Gun Ships would be to serve in the Rivers on this Continent ; they are handy Ships , and from their easy Draught of Water can go in and out of Harbours without that great Risque and Delay which constantly attends the piloting those now with me .

		And as the principal part of the Duty here is done by Boats I shall be extremely obliged to their Lordships if they will be pleased to give directions that each Ship and Sloop coming out in future may have an additional Boat for her own Use , and that Supply be also sent to the Ships now in
America	LOCATION	.

		I believe I need not add that none can be built or repaired now but at
Halifax	LOCATION	; Every Days Experience shews that we can hope for no Supplies the Rebels can prevent : their Vigilance extends even to Firewood , which is expressly forbidden to be sold ; And I am this moment informed Guards are placed along the Coast for that purpose .

		The
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	is upwards of sixty Marines short of Complement ; they are so useful a Body at all times , and at this Juncture it is so requisite to keep each Ships Complement compleat , that I can not avoid entreating their Lordships to allow any Ships coming from
England	LOCATION	to bring out supernumerary Marines for that purpose .

		After rowing hard all night we arrived within half a mile of the place at sun rise , sent a man to bring us information , and in a small creek , infested with numberless swarms of gnats and muskitoes , waited with impatience for his return .

		The man returning , informed us they were unapprized of our coming , though they had heard of the taking of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	and Crown point .

		We directly pushed for shore , and landed at about sixty rods distance from the barracks ; the men had their arms , but upon our briskly marching up in their faces , they retired within the barracks , left their arms , and resigned themselves into our hands .

		We took fourteen prisoners , fourteen stands of arms , and some small stores .

		We also took the King 's sloop , two fine brass field pieces , and four boats .

		We destroyed five boats more lest they should be made use of against us .

		Just at the completion of our business , a fine gale arose from the north !

		we directly hoisted sail and returned in triumph .

		About six miles from St.
John	PERSON	's , we met Colonel
-LSB- Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	with four boats and ninety men , who determined to proceed and maintain the ground .

		This scheme Col.

Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RSB- Thursday , May 18 , 1775 The president laid before the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, some important intelligence he receivd last night , by express from
New York	LOCATION	, relative to the surprising and taking of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, by a detachment from
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	and
Connecticut	LOCATION	which was read ... Upon motion , Agreed , That Mr.
-LSB- John -RSB- Brown	PERSON	, who brought the express , be called in to give an accot of the disposition of the Canadians , 2 the taking of
Ticonderoga	PERSON	and the importance of that post .

		Whereupon he was called in ー and having given the necessary information he withdrew .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	taking the matter into consideration came to the following Resolution , Resolved , Whereas there is indubitable evidence that a design is formed by the British Ministry of making a cruel invasion from the province of Quebec , upon these coionies , for the purpose of destroying our lives and liberties , and some steps have actually been taken to carry the said design into execution .

		And whereas several inhabitants of the northern colonies , residing in the vicinity of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, and immediately exposed to incursions , impelled by a just regard for the defence and preservation of themselves and their countrymen from such imminent dangers and calamities have taken possession of that post , in which was lodged a quantity of cannon and military stores , that would certainly have been used in the intended invasion of these colonies , this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	earnestly recommend it to the committees of the cities and counties of
New York	LOCATION	and
Albany	LOCATION	, immediately to cause the said cannon and military stores to be removed from
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	to the south end of
Lake George	LOCATION	; and if necessary to apply to the colonies of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	bay , and
Connecticut	LOCATION	, for such an additional body of forces as wiU be sufficient to establish a strong post at that place and effectually to secure the said cannon and stores or so many of them as it may be judged proper to keep there .

		And that an exact inventory be taken of all such cannon and stores in order that they may be safely returned when the restoration of the former harmony between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and these colonies so ardently wished for by the latter shall render it prudent and consistent with the overruling law of self preservation .

		COLONEL
BENEDICT	PERSON	ARNOLD TO THE
MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY ,
CAMBRIDGE	ORGANIZATION	1 Gentlemen Crown Point , 19th May 1775 ー My last was of the 14th Instant by Mr -LSB-
Bernard -RSB- Romans	PERSON	, via
New Haven	LOCATION	.

		I then acquainted you of the Occasion of Delay in not carrying your Orders into execution .

		ー The Afternoon of the same Day , being joined by
Captains Brown & Oswald	ORGANIZATION	, with 50 Men inlisted on the
Road	LOCATION	, they having taken Possession of a small Schooner , at
Skenesborough	LOCATION	, we immediately proceeded on our Way for
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, and at 8 o'Clock ,
P.M	LOCATION	; the 17th Instant arrived within 30 Miles of
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Weather proving calm , we mannd out two small
Batteaux	PERSON	, with 35 Men , & the next Morning at 6 o'Clock , arrived at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, surprized & took a
Sargeant & his Party	ORGANIZATION	of 12 Men , the King 's Sloop of about 70 Tons , with 2 brass 6-pounders & 7 Men , without any Loss on either Side .

		ー The Captain was gone to
Montreal	LOCATION	, & hourly expected with a large Detachment for
Ticonderoga	PERSON	, a Number of Guns & Carriages for the Sloop , which was just fixed for sailing ; add to this there was a Captain & 40 Men at
Chamblee	LOCATION	, 12 Miles distant from
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, who was expected there every Minute with his
Party	ORGANIZATION	; so that it seemed to be a mere Interposition of
Providence	LOCATION	that we arrived in so fortunate an Hour .

		We took such Stores on board as were valuable , & the Wind proving favourable , in two Hours after our arrival , weighed Anchor for this place , with the Sloop & 4 of the kings
Batteaux	PERSON	, having destroy 'd 5 others ; so that there is not left a single
Batteau	PERSON	for the kings Troops , Canadians or Indians , to cross the
Lake	LOCATION	in if they have any such Intention .

		ー I must , in Justice to Col.
-LSB- Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	, observe , that he left Crown Point soon after me for
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	with 150 Men & on my Return I met him 5
Leagues	ORGANIZATION	this Side , & supplied him with Provisions , his Men being in a starving Condition .

		ー He informed me of his Intention of proceeding on to St
John	PERSON	's with 80 or 100 Men , & keeping Possession there .

		ー It appeared to me a wild , impracticable Scheme , & provided it could be carried into execution , of no Consequence , so long as we are Masters of the
Lake	LOCATION	, & of that I make no Doubt , as I am determined to arm the Sloop & Schooner immediately .

		ー I wrote you , Gentlemen , in my former Letter , that I should be extremely glad to be superceded in my Command here , as I find it next to impossible to repair the old
Fort	LOCATION	at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, & am not qualified to direct in building a new one.ー I am really of Opinion , it will be necessary to employ 1000 or 1500 Men here this Summer , in which I have the Pleasure of being joined in Sentiment by Mr Romans , who is esteem 'd an able Engineer .

		ー I am making all possible Provisions for wheel Carriages & c to carry such Cannon & c to
Albany	LOCATION	, as can be spared here & will be servicable to our Army at Cambridgeー I must refer you for Particulars to the Bearer ,
Capt Jonathan Brown	PERSON	, who has been very active & servicable , & is a prudent & good Officer , and beg leave to observe , I have had Intimations given me , that some Persons had determined to apply to you & the Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, to injure me in your esteem by misrepresenting Matters of Fact .

		ー I know of no other Motive they can have , only my refusing them Commissions , from the very simple Reason , that I did not think them qualified : ー however , Gentlemen , I have the Satisfaction of imagining I am employ 'd by Gentlemen of so much Candour that my Conduct will not be condemned untill I have the Opportunity of being heardー I am -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		The Captain was hourly expected from
Montreal	LOCATION	, with a large detachment of men , some guns and carriages for the sloop ; as was a Captain with 40 men from
Chamblee	PERSON	, which is twelve miles distant from St.
John	PERSON	's ; so that providence seems to have smiled on us in arriving at so fortunate an hour ; for , had we been six hours later , in all probability we should have miscarried in our design .

		ー The wind proving favourable in two hours after our arrival , we got on board all the stores , provisions , & c. and weighed anchor for this place , with the sloop and five large batteaus , which we seized , having destroyed five others , and arrived here at ten this morning , not leaving one craft of any kind behind that that enemy can cross the lake in , if they have any such intention .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	,
WILLIAMSBURG	ORGANIZATION	1 My Lord ,
Preston Boston	PERSON	20th May 1775 I have had the Honour to receive your Lordship 's Letter of the 1st of May and see with Concern the unwarrantable and lawless proceedings of the people of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the Danger your Lordship is exposed to by endeavouring to support his Majesty 's just
Authority	ORGANIZATION	amongst an ungrateful and rebellious people .

		The action of the 19th of April , of which I inclose your Lordship a printed Account , has hitherto had the worst consequences to the
King 's Authority	ORGANIZATION	in this and the neighbouring Provinces .

		In fact the Rebellion is general : The Proceedings of the Governments of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	and
Connecticut	LOCATION	and the Committees of
New York	LOCATION	,
Pensilvania	LOCATION	, Jerseys and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	leave no Room to doubt their being of the same Mind with the Rebels of this Province : They are actually making the most vigorous preparations for War .

		The Town of
Boston	LOCATION	is shut up by the Rebel Troops , whose advanced Centinels are within a few paces of ours .

		There is no communication by Land .

		The Rebels prohibiting every thing from being brought into
Boston	LOCATION	under pain of Death .

		The Inhabitants with their Effects are leaving the Town by permission , and it is generally believed that when they are all out , the Rebels will attack the Town ; The General tells me that flat bottomed boats are building for this purpose at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		A numerous and well appointed
Army	ORGANIZATION	is assembled , which without the protection of the Kings Ships can utterly destroy this Town and the Troops pent up in it .

		Castle
William	PERSON	is at this time actually guarded by the Men of War .

		Under these Circumstances it gives me great pain that I am unable to comply fully with your Lordship 's requisition to send a large Ship to
Virginia	LOCATION	, being perfectly satisfied how serviceable she could be at this Juncture ; But my Lord I flatter myself when your Lordship is acquainted with the true situation of his Majesty 's Affairs in this Town and Province , and of the great preparations actually making to dislodge the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Troops ; Your Lordship will perceive I could not without the utmost Risque send another large Ship from hence ; The
Asia	LOCATION	being gone to
New York	LOCATION	the beginning of this month .

		I have however sent Captain
-LSB- Matthew -RSB- Squire	PERSON	in his Majesty 's
Sloop Otter	ORGANIZATION	to put himself under the Command of Captain -LSB-
George -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	, who will I am satisfied continue to assist your Lordship and protect his Majesty 's faithful Subjects to the utmost of his Power , and when a Reinforcement comes from
England	LOCATION	, your Lordship may depend upon my paying the utmost Attention in my power to your application , consistent with the Orders I may receive , and the Exigencies of his
Majesty 's Service	ORGANIZATION	in this Country .

		ARTHUR LEE TO
RICHARD HENRY	PERSON	LEE 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- My Dear Brother The temper of the times is painted in such legible colours in the King 's Speech , that no one can remain in doubt that arms are to be used to divest us of our Liberties .

		You will see by the Paper our Brother incloses that the Lords have promisd their support .

		Yesterday the Commom did the same on a division of 254 to 60 .

		The new
Parlaiment	ORGANIZATION	is therefore engaged to maintain this sanguinary System , to which the King in readg his Speech marked his hearty assent , to the astonishment of his Hearers , by giving a studied emphasis to those words which were severe against
America	LOCATION	.

		You have now the whole before you .

		If your Non-importation & Non-exportation Agreement be not immediately executed & religiously observed , Arms or Submission must decide the Controversy .

		The prohibition of exporting Arms & Ammunition from here ought to teach you a great deal .

		I need not mention how deplorable how despicable his situation must be , who talks high of resistance & yet makes no preparation .

		He who talks of drawing the Sword should not only have it to draw , but see that it be sharp .

		I woud recommend to you the example of
Cromwell	PERSON	who had a Troop of his own neibours , tried & personally attachd to him , at the head of which he was always enabled to make a decisive impression .

		The present intention of the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	is to declare all Meetings & associations in
America	LOCATION	illegal & treasonable ー to guard the Coast agst all traffic & communication with
Holland France & Spain	ORGANIZATION	ー to corrupt
New York	LOCATION	ー and to employ a military force , chiefly from
Canada	LOCATION	, if necessary .

		Having their designs before you , your attention I trust will be bent to defeat them with that earnestness which the greatest question in the world demands .

		As in future it may be necessary to write some things in Cypher , that wch I shall use & wch you may use to me will be in figures each figure standing for a Letter of the same number in the Alphabet .

		For example King 219247 .

		K being the 21st , i the 9th n , the 24th & g the 7th Letter in the alphabet .

		When it gets to ten , two figures are necessary for one Letter , therefore I join them together by a stroke across , which I think woud puzzle a decypherer the more .

		As a farther security no name shoud be signd , the date but not the place , inclosd in a Cover addressd by another hand , & no address at the beginning I wish you woud keep a watchful eye over Capt -LSB-
Edward -RSB- Foy	PERSON	.

		His disposition is insolent & arbitrary , however he may cover it & depend upon it his endeavors will not be unexercised to enslave us .

		You have Lead mines & can prepare Salt Petre in your Tobacco Houses ; for gods sake begin your Preparations in time ー talk little & do much .

		Let not necessity come upon you like an armd ` man , & find you defenceless .

		Sir
Willm Draper	PERSON	has publishd a proposal for emancipating your Negroes by royal Proclamation & arming them against you .

		The proposal met with approbation from ministerial People .

		Do not laugh at it , till you are sure it woud be vain .

		If you apprehend it wou 'd be dangerous take proper precautions against it .

		Considering the proposals which are made & the measures taken here against us I think it perfectly just , & I am sure it is necessary that you shoud withold the payment of your Debts to the Merchants here .

		It is but truth to say that they are the bitterest enemies we have .

		It is not once , but a thousand times they have said of us ー `` Let them pay us our debts & go to the Devil . ''

		... The french
Court	ORGANIZATION	is settling its internal Affairs , with great attention & wisdom .

		The Minister makes no secret of his intention to assist us .

		But it shoud be our care so to exert ourselves as to make as little as possible of such perilous assistance necessary .

		Are you sure that the ultimate aim of the Governor 's & his Secretary 's late expedition was not to debauch them from the service of their Country in the great question & to give them that
Privilege of the Country	PERSON	as to enable them to oppose those who may arm in support of their Rights .

		Let no means be omitted of cultivating and inflaming the frontier men , who are by much the most capable of making a stand .

		I suppose no more Assemblies will be calld till things are settled , therefore you shd look forward & provide against the consequences of that .

		I throw before you all the thoughts wch float in my anxious mind .

		Some of them I hope may be useful .

		Make a memorandum of what is material in this Letter & then burn it .

		Dear Sir I am favord with yours of July 10th & am much obliged by the consignmt of 4 hhds of Tobo P Roman for which I hope shortly to transmit you satisfactory sales You will in all probability be a gainer by the Tobo you have left in the Country of the old crop , since there is almost an absolute certainty of the price rising greatly here upon yr exportation stoping in Septr , which I presume will most certainly take place according the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	association , as there does not appear any chance of yr grievances being redressed this session of Parliamt , but I am firmly of opinion , that a strict & firm perseverance on the part of
America	LOCATION	in the measures adopted by the congress of her States , must inevitably procure her Justice at last .

		And I am also further of opinion , that the longer the contest continues the more it will contribute to the benefit & independance of
America	LOCATION	.

		In this contest the
Tobo Colonies	ORGANIZATION	can not loose as the price of one crop on the exportation stoping will nearly equal that of two .

		As yr importation of goods is stopd Mr Sadlers musick & c , can not be sent now , however I hope

M. GARNIER	PERSON	, FRENCH CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	, TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	LOCATION	, FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 19 January 1775 My lord , I had the honor to inform you in my letter No. 236 at the beginning of last Nov. that the plan agreed upon by the Ministry with reference to the province of
Massachusett	LOCATION	was to forbid all trade with this province and abandon it to its own anarchy , if the governor was unable to form a Civil Chamber in order to enforce the law by civil means .

		I could not doubt the reality of this determination which I held from the best source .

		This only was what was meant by the furthering of the recourse to strength .

		The speech of the King at the opening of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	seemed to attribute more energy to the intentions of the Ministery according to public opinion and it was generally believed that hostilities were unavoidable .

		In these agitated times came the news of the resolutions passed by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that were to leave no doubt as to the firmness and unanimity of the Americans .

		Since all the Colonies had become equally guilty , it was no longer a question to know whether or not one would continue using a few regiments and a few ships in order to deal severely with a rebellious province .

		The progress of the rebellion required a more extensive plan and the question was to determine whether or not European
England	LOCATION	would wage war against American
England	LOCATION	... If I am well informed of the resolutions decided upon , they deal mainly with two subjects : first , to pass a bill temporarily forbidding any trade with the Americans ; second , to give orders to the various governors of the Colonies so that they call upon all the inhabitants who disapprove the resolutions passed by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to sign their names during a given time , by means of which the Government promises them efficient support against all comers , beyond which time all those who will not have conformed with this injunction will be declared traitors to their country and treated as such .

		This is the counter-part of what the Americans themselves are doing to day and it is obviously designed to provoke division among them .

		You will be better judge than myself , My Lord , as to the effect that can be expected , but it seems to me that it will bring civil war .

		The King of
England	LOCATION	apparently believed that this course was preferable to that of losing His authority by calling
Myd	PERSON	.


Chatham	LOCATION	into his Council .

		He is embarking on quite an arduous journey and I wish he will come to a safe port .

		If he succeeds , His authority will be established more than ever and he will probably be rid for always of His fright of Lord
Chatham	LOCATION	; if he fails , he will have delayed at least for some time the coming of this Minister into His Council .

		The Ministers who have been expressing themselves for some time only in the vaguest and most reserved terms , are speaking today with more authority .

		The Americans are accused of wishing to destroy the act of navigation , although they avoided to attack this subject in the resolutions that they published .

		As long as conciliatory ways were left open , one tried here to lessen the importance of their crimes .

		Today , they are made more guilty than they actually are .

		It is claimed that it would be better not to have any Colonies at all than support some on the footing that the Americans request , and should one give in to their claims , one should see tomorrow
Ireland	LOCATION	presenting identical ones to which one should also have to give in ; finally the power of the King would become as insignificant as that of the King of
Poland	LOCATION	; should he weaken at this time .

		Myd .


Townshend	PERSON	, Great Master of the Artillery , spoke to me in this tone yesterday and added that had he thought he were not able to subdue the Americans , he would not have been so treacherous as to go that very day and pay his court to the King .

		However , things are proceeding as usual in
America	LOCATION	.

		Evil is spreading rapidly ; and the number of petitions that several corporations are preparing here in order to present them to the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	is increasing .

		The Corporation of
Bristol	LOCATION	agreed upon one on the 13th of this month ; the merchants and plantation owners in the
West Indies	LOCATION	are doing the same thing .

		The latter are all the more alarmed because they are forced to send for in
Europe	LOCATION	what they used to get from the Continent and they claim that the increased expenses will cause them to lose more than half of their income .

		So the campaign begins today and it will not be long before the papers concerning
America	LOCATION	are presented to the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	that will appoint committees in order to examine them .

		It will be on the basis of the report of these committees that the legislative body will take its decisions ; thus , within a short time , we will know what to expect .

		-LSB- P.S. -RSB- The Admiralty has just informed me that the order has been given to fit out eight corvettes for
America	LOCATION	, They are :
Senegal	LOCATION	,
Merlin	PERSON	, Otter , Cherokee , Surprise ,
Pomona	LOCATION	,
Martin	PERSON	, Zephyr .

		This piece of news , My lord , seems to confirm undoubtedly the intention of which I had the honor to speak to you to stop the trade of the Americans .

		... of this spirit of independence , animating the nation of
America	LOCATION	, I have the most authentic information .

		It is not new among them ; it is , and has ever been , their established principle , their confirmed .

		persuasion : it is their nature and their doctrine ... Trade is an extended and complicated consideration : it reaches as far as ships can sail or winds can blow : it is a great and various machine .

		To regulate the numberless movements of its several parts , and combine them into effect , for the good of the whole , requires the superintending wisdom and energy of the supreme power in the empire ... .

		When your lordships look at the papers transmitted us from
America	LOCATION	; when you consider their decency , firmness , and wisdom , you can not but respect their cause , and wish to make it your own ... .

		I have read Thucydides , and have studied and admired the master-states of the world ー that for solidity of reasoning , force of sagacity , and wisdom of conclusion , under such a complication of difficult circumstances , no nation or body of men , can stand in preference to the general
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	... Every motive , therefore , of justice and of policy , of dignity and of prudence , urges you to allay the ferment in
America	LOCATION	ー by a removal of your troops from
Boston	LOCATION	ー by a repeal of your acts of parliament ー and by demonstration of amicable dispositions towards your colonies .

		On the other hand , every danger and every hazard impend , to deter you from perserverance in your present ruinous measures .

		ー Foreign war hanging over your heads by a slight and brittle thread :
France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	watching your conduct , and waiting for the maturity of your errors ; ー with a vigilant eye to
America	LOCATION	, and the temper of your colonies , more than to their own concerns , be they what they may .

North America	LOCATION	, the public revenue is threatened with a large and fatal diminution , the petitioners with grievous distress , and thousands of industrious artificers and manufacturers with utter ruin ; under these alarming circumstances , the petitioners receive no small comfort , from a persuasion that the representatives of the people , newly delegated to the most important of all trusts , will take the whole of these weighty matters into their most serious consideration ; and therefore praying the
House	ORGANIZATION	, that they will enter into a full and immediate examination of that system of commercial policy , which was formerly adopted , and uniformly maintained , to the happiness and advantage of both countries , and will apply such healing remedies as can alone restore and establish the commerce between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her colonies on a permanent foundation ... 1 .

America	LOCATION	, as well by British as foreign Ships , and as it becomes so necessary in the present Juncture to prevent as much as possible the continuance of it , Orders have been sent to the Commanders of His Majesty 's Ships in the American Seas to be particularly attentive to intercept and seize any British or foreign Ships which may be found with prohibited Goods , or warlike Stores destined for His Majesty 's Colonies in
America	LOCATION	.

		I have thought it not improper to mention this to

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 27 January 1775 My lord , The dice are cast : the Government seems to be determined to break down the Americans .

		In addition to the marines which it has been decided to send , as I had the honor to inform you , the order was sent last wednesday to the
Vice-Roy	PERSON	of
Ireland	LOCATION	to prepare everything for the transport of three infantry regiments and one light cavalry regiment .

		Each infantry regiment consists of one battalion of 477 men .

		The light cavalry regiment stationed in
Ireland	LOCATION	is made up of six companies and at the present consists only of 179 dragoons .

		But 18 men will be added to each company , half of whom will be recruited in
Ireland	LOCATION	and the other half will be on detachment from the light cavalry of
Elliot	PERSON	and
Burgoyne	PERSON	stationed in
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		The latter numbering only 94 men will embark without their horses .

		Since they are all good horsemen , it was deemed that they could easily get used to the horses they will find in
America	LOCATION	.

		These reinforcements , including the marines number 2,418 men , and the Governement states that General
Gage	PERSON	will have about 9,000 men under his command .

		He will receive at the same time an additional detachment of artillery ... As Myd Rochford spoke to me on this subject yesterday , he was kind enough to explain positively that the intention was not so much to act with hostility against the Americans as to encourage in the Colonies the friends of the Government who had not dared declare their opinions for lack of sufficient forces to protect them .

		However , if these troops are to be used solely for the protection of well-disposed people , they run the risk to be weak everywhere since they will be spread throughout the various colonies ... This Minister informed me that he would write to
Myd Stormont	LOCATION	today and instruct him to convey to you the decision taken by the Governement to stop completely the trade of the Americans , considering that they trade only in contraband upon which a closer watch will be kept than in the past .

		All foreign or national ships that will be found loaded with war ammunition for the Americans or trading with the English Colonies on the Continent will be seized .

		I am inclined to believe , My lord , that the British Ambassador will only allude to this matter and with great caution .

		I answered
Myd Rochford	PERSON	that the Court of
London	LOCATION	could rely upon the strict observance of the treaties on our part , and that in matters of justice , since the King conformed to it as faithfully with respect to his neighbors as he expected the same on their part , His Majesty would always suit the precept to the example .

PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	TO VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 Sir -LSB-
Admiralty Office	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- 28h January 1775 I have received and communicated to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty your Letters of the 23d September , 30h of October , 3d 4th and 20th of November , and 15th of December last , giving an account of your proceedings with the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under your
Command	ORGANIZATION	; And in return I have the satisfaction to acquaint you that their Lordships very well approve thereof .

		You will have observed by my Letter of the 23d of last Month that their Lordships were pleased to direct you to send the
Rose	PERSON	immediately to
England	LOCATION	being one of the
Newfoundland Squadron	ORGANIZATION	and also the Tartar ,
Glasgow	LOCATION	, and
Swan Sloop	PERSON	, for the reasons thereinmentioned , when they could with propriety be spared from their respective Stations .

		I am now to acquant you that their Lordships have ordered another Frigate to be fitted out for the
Newfoundland Station	LOCATION	, and that you are therefor to consider the
Rose	PERSON	as one of the Ships of your Squadron and to employ her in such manner as you shall judge best for His Majesty 's Service ; But as her Captain is in the same predicament as those of the two Ships and Sloop abovementioned , Vizt that of having commanded her upwards of three Years , their Lordships would have you send her , together with them to
England	LOCATION	at the fall of the Year , when they can no longer cruize upon the Coast , unless the exigency of the
Service	ORGANIZATION	entrusted to your care , should render it necessary for you to keep them still longer in
America	LOCATION	; in which case you are at liberty to do so .

		Their Lordships have ordered Six Sloops to be fitted out as soon as possible to reinforce the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under your
Command	ORGANIZATION	, and will send them to you , as they are severally in readiness ; Besides which , the
St Lawrence Schooner	ORGANIZATION	will be refitted and sent back , and you will see , by their Lordships order of this date , that you are to cause three New Schooners to be purchased and put upon the same Establishment as His Majesty 's other Schooners .

		If besides this Reinforcement You should judge it expedient to hire two or three Schooners in addition to those which you were directed to hire by their Lordships Order of the 13h of October -LRB- as you seem by your Letter of the 15h of December to think you should -RRB- their Lordships are pleased to permit you to do so , taking care however that they be continued in the Service no longer than shall be absolutely necessary .

		I have nothing further in Command from their Lordships but to recommend it to you to concert with General

		RICHARD CHAMPION TO WILLING ,
MORRIS & CO.	ORGANIZATION	1
Gentlemen Bristol	ORGANIZATION	31 Jany 1775 I wrote you a few Lines to give you the melancholy News of the designs of Ministry to persist in their foolish and wicked Attempts against
America	LOCATION	the Wind having ever since detained this Vessel I am enabled to acknowledge the receipts of your favors of 10.21 & 21 Decr The Insurance was made agreable to your orders .

		The Friendship does not yet appear .

		I shall pay due Honour to your
Bill to Mess Sayers Chambers & Co	ORGANIZATION	# 981.15 ー when you draw payable in
London	LOCATION	you will please to draw at a longer date than here ; as the difference of time is from twenty to thirty days owing to a provision being necessary to be made there in time Notwithstanding the Arrival of several
Cargoes Wheat	ORGANIZATION	continues at 7 / & will be supported tho the Sale will be slower than common however I am happy in being able to render you in all probability if the Vessel arrives safe , & the Cargo in good order a good Sales .

		I never was so much at a loss what to think of the approaching Period , as I am at present .

		The Country is in want of grain , & had it not been for these Supplies , we should have been in great distress .

		Many Cargoes arriving together , tho ' they occasioned the sale 's being now slow yet the prices do not , & will not fall below 7 / .

		but how this will be when the Manufacturers are dicharged from Employment and a scene of riot & confusion ensues is emposseble to foresee If the
Populace	ORGANIZATION	should rise for they must be in a Starving State , Granaries generally become the first sacrifices & Corn must be sold out cheap to satisfy them .

		These Disorders are to be expected .

		I should therefore think it most prudent by no means to venture at this market at a hyrer price than what the friendships ' cost & at the Exchange you quote ; even this is too high in my opinion to ballance the hazard which may accrue from the expected disburstanc -LSB- e -RSB- s in
England	LOCATION	.

		I am of opinion that the Months of July & August will not be the worst for prices , as the Season this Winter has been so very mild , as to make us expect the Spring to be very backward , & consequently the Summer to be unfavorable to the Harvest a Circumstance which often happens .

		Besides in this Country there are some complaints of the Corn from the extream wet , which may in the End prove of bad consequence .

		These are now Conjectures which
Time	ORGANIZATION	only can determine but they appear to me to be founded on some probability so much so , that I will be concerned one third in two or three Cargoes of fine Wheat of the prices you mention at not exceeding the prices of Six Shillings p bushel or even on board of Six Shillings & Six pence ; higher I have given you my reasons why I think it imprudent , & this is beyond what I think Wheat will be at with you , when the demand is a little abated .

		You will please to let your motions be governed by the quantities you know are destined for our market , which by your extensive Correspondence you will be able to learn .

		I shall keep you constantly advised The Champion
Stanton	PERSON	belonging to me I have if not loaded at
Carolina	LOCATION	ordered to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		if he does not get a good freight at
Carolina	LOCATION	, he is to come to

		Your Bills shall meet due Honour for what you draw on my Account , & on yours also , which I shall be obliged to you to do at as long a date as you can , & after the Vessels are sailed if convenient , as it will make the advance easier , & I should be glad to give every assistance in my power to you .

		I wrote you two days ago by the Packet in which I acknowledged the receipt of your several favors down to the 28th .

		December altho ' I could not then write in Answer fully to them for want of time ー I am fully convinced that the Somersets Sales not getting out sooner , lost us a good deal of Tobacco , and yet those Sales were sent out much sooner after the Arrival of the Ship here , than they used some years agoe , ever to be , but now it is become a custom in order to recommend themselves and to take advantage of others for the Merchts in the Tobacco Trade some of them at least , to send out the Sales , even before the Tobacco is sold , and unfortunately for us , that Ship Arrived so late that unless we had taken the above method , there was not really a Sufficient length of time to do the business in , before the Shipping Season came on again in
Maryland	LOCATION	, and then the want of the Accounts of the Somersets Load , was made a pretence for not shipping more by the People , without considerg whether the Sales of that Cargo had been detained or kept back longer , or even so long as in general
Accots Sales	LOCATION	, are ー As to the Goods , I know they never were sent out so Irregular before , and however strange it may seem , it was owing to my wishing to have them packed and sent away better than usual , that they came to be worse , for not content with having that part of the business , done by such hands as it had generally been done for me , I employed what I , and every body thought , a sedate experienced Man , and one that had been in the business ever since he could do any thing , and yet thus I was served ー I observe you say you have accepted the two Bills , & have given good Bonds as Security , but why will not you make
Manduet	ORGANIZATION	and the rest here , easy by giving Land Security , for nothing else I know will Satisfye them , and as you can do it , why not ー I mean no more by it than you do , and think the Bonds as good Security as Land , or your own Acceptance as good as either , but if other People can not or will not think so , I cant make themー There has been no Alteration in the price of Tobacco since I wrote you last , but it is very likely there soon may , for the resolution taken in the

Versailles	LOCATION	-RSB- 8 February 1775 The Viscount of
Stormont	ORGANIZATION	2 spoke to me in general terms of the resolution adopted by His Government to stop the trade of the Colonies and to prevent contraband .

		The second item of this resolution is to conform to the conditions existing not only in the English Colonies , but all the other Colonies in
America	LOCATION	.

		Their trade is exclusive and does not let in foreigners .

		Thus , the intention announced by the British
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	concerns a matter sanctioned by a generally adopted usage .

		You may assure
Milord Rochford	PERSON	that the King will not authorize His subjects to contravene this agreement and that he will not protect those who dared transgress it ; but at the same time , you will tell this Minister that we are convinced that he will have taken the necessary precautions so that the ships in charge of the surveillance of the coasts of English
America	LOCATION	do not interfere with the trade of our own Colonies , that these ships should not extend their cruise under empty excuses begotten only by a greed for spoils and should not be so bold as to come in the vicinity of our
Islands	LOCATION	and stop , visit and seize those of our ships that import the goods necessary for the consumption and defense of the said
Islands	LOCATION	and export their home produce .

		We do not allow ourselves to doubt that His British Majesty has given or will give the strictest and most precise orders to that effect to the Commanding Officers of the ships that He sent or will send to

West Indies	LOCATION	; and to prohibit such provinces and colonies from carrying on any fishery on the banks of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, or other places therein to be mentioned , under certain conditions , and for a time to be limited . ''

		-LSB- Passed in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, Wednesday , March 8 , 1775 , and in the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, Tuesday , March 21 , 1775 -RSB- 1 .

		Parliamentary History , XVIII , 298-299 .

		DEBATE IN THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS 1 Feb. 13 .

		The
House	ORGANIZATION	being in a
Committee of Supply	ORGANIZATION	, Mr. -LSB-
John -RSB- Buller	PERSON	moved , That an additional number of 2,000 men be allowed for Sea Service for the year 1775 .

		He stated the respective services our ships were on , and said that the proposed augmentation was necessary to enforce the measures of government in
America	LOCATION	.

		Lord
North	PERSON	remarked , that the subject had been so amply discussed on Friday , by being so much blended with the means of restraining the fishery of
Massachuset	PERSON	's
Bay	LOCATION	, that he should have the less to offer upon this occasion ; that the rebellious disposition and motions of that and other colonies made it necessary to have such a guard upon the coasts of
North America	LOCATION	, that the augmentation was highly necessary ; and as the people of
New England	LOCATION	could not be restrained from the fishery without some sloops stationed for that purpose , the circumstance made it doubly requisite to provide accordingly ... .

		Lord
John Cavendish	PERSON	and Colonel
Barré	PERSON	accused the noble lord of great inconsistency , in thinking so far to blind the
House	ORGANIZATION	as to have it believed that the augmentation asked for could answer any purpose but to convince the Americans of the inveteracy of the mother country against them , and to throw a reconciliation to a yet greater distance : that a few thousand seamen added to the service would never effectually answer the purpose , if that purpose was to prohibit the trade of the most commercial colonies in
America	LOCATION	; that the noble lord must mean only to trifle with the
House	ORGANIZATION	, and with mankind , in declaring one day
America	LOCATION	to be in rebellion , the next prohibiting the commerce of
Massachuset 's Bay	LOCATION	, and the third coming for so insignificant an augmentation ; that the gentlemen on the same side of the
House	ORGANIZATION	had repeatedly asserted , that the commerce of the New Englanders , and much of that of the other colonies , was contraband ; and that
America	LOCATION	was peopled with smugglers , to the great detriment of that advantage , which would otherwise flow to this country : how could administration , therefore , with any degree of consistency , suppose that such a system of smuggling , added to a new created system of the same , the fishery , be all kept under by any thing less than the most powerful armaments ?

		Captain -LSB-
Thomas DeGroy	PERSON	,
Baron -RSB- Walsingham	PERSON	insisted that our present naval force was by no means adequate to the execution of our professed intentions ; for that the squadron we designed for
America	LOCATION	would answer no purpose of stopping their commerce ; or if we did send a sufficient one , our own coasts , comparatively speaking , must be left totally defenceless ; as he was well informed , that
France	LOCATION	alone had 75 men of war of the line now , more than one half of which were manned , and fit for actual service .

		He then gave an account of a conversation which passed lately between him and a French gentleman well acquainted with the state of their navy ; from which he was fully satisfied that the whole of our force , in every part of the world , would not be sufficient to defend us at home , should we blindly rush into a civil war .

		Mr.
Sawbridge	PERSON	said , he perceived that administration were hurrying the nation to certain ruin , but he should reserve himself to speak on our present conduct towards
America	LOCATION	, till a fitter and some more convenient opportunity .

		The motion was agreed to without a division .

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 14 February 1775 I have , My lord , fully carried out your orders by observing to
Myd Rochford	PERSON	that , as the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	had deemed necessary to restrict the trade of
New England	LOCATION	, we do not doubt that His British Majesty gave His sea officers the strictest and most precise orders not to interfere with the trade of our Colonies and not to come near our possessions under any circumstances to visit those of our ships loaded with all that is necessary for the consumption and defense of our Colonies .


Myd Rochford	PERSON	assured me that their naval officers had been advised to behave towards us with more caution and more reserve than ever .

		This minister added I was to believe that they had the greatest desire to live with us on the best terms and in perfect friendship and should some accident occur , they would be far more annoyed about it than we ... This meeting took place on the 12th of this month .

		Some time later , I met
Myd Sandwich	PERSON	himself and I told him of my conversation with
Myd Rochford	PERSON	, deeming this precaution all the more important because by giving credit to
Myd Rochford	PERSON	for his good intentions , we have more than once experienced that it is advisable to look out for his assurances and that he displays a tendency to make light his promises .

		Myd Sandwich did not tell me that they will place more care and caution than ever in the orders given to the sea officers .

		He simply assured me that should some accident occur that would rouse our complaints , they would do us justice promptly and punish the persons responsible .

		I answered that he knew how much easier it is to prevent than to cure and that we relied on all his care in this respect .

		He repeated to me the same friendly assurances that I had already received from the Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	in this matter , adding that their officers would receive orders only to prevent contraband with the English Colonies , whereupon I deemed necessary to observe that these most legitimate orders would not come against any obstacle on our part but that they were to be carried on their waters and not on ours .

Bilbao	PERSON	15th Feby 1775 As soon as your much esteemed favour 16th Decr came to hand , we began to Consider about the method of complying with your orders , in case of your further desire , & Altho ' of a very difficulty nature , we were determind at all events to assist you accordingly , we found out means to procure as many Musketts & pistols as were ready made on the parts for the
Kings Army	ORGANIZATION	, the quantity was but small having only 300 Muskets & Bayonetts , & about double the number of Pair of Pistols ready , but we should have done our utmost to get as many more as was to be found in order to serve you , & shall whenever you shou 'd command ; but must observe to you that such an Order ought to come some Months before , for all Arms on this side are made on the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Account , & it is a rareity to find them ready made , besides which they must be got , with a good deal of Caution & Ship on the very same manner ; as to secrecy you may depend it is as much our Interest as any ones as the English Embassader will look sharp in every port , & we are upon very good footing with my Lord
Grantham	PERSON	2 Should be very Sorry he should know it ー The Powder is an Article which we can not ship unless we have timely advice , for whatever there is made in this
Kingdom	LOCATION	is for the Government , it is our opinion that Should any of your vessels be taken in the Channel loaded with those articles , she should certainly be condemned , however by having timely advise we can bring them from
Holland	LOCATION	on Reasonable Terms & ship them as you desire .

		We see with the utmost concern the difficulties You labour under by an unpolitical Minister 's wrong direction of Affairs , But hope the
Present Parliament	ORGANIZATION	will look into them with clearer light , & will find proper means to accomodate Matters , without going any further , allowing you your just Rights & Libertys , which we do assure you long to see it settled with all our hearts but should it be otherwise -LRB- which God forbid -RRB- command freely and you will find us at your service , we doubted not but you would be made a member of the

		COUNT DE VERGENNES TO
M. GARNIER	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Versailles	LOCATION	, 16 February 1775 We were very surprised , Sir , by the assertion made by
Myd Sandwich	PERSON	, concerning three French ships being loaded , according to him , at l'Orient for the English Colonies in
America	LOCATION	.

		Before advancing a statement of this nature , it would have been wiser on the part of this Minister to establish the facts so as not to expose himself to a denial or to the necessity of a withdrawal .

		Since it would undoubtedly not be fair to accuse him of carelessness , we must assume that he was very poorly informed by his spies , or that he has particular designs which we could not see through and which made him take the liberty to advance an assertion of this nature .

		Whatever the case , Sir , nothing is more untrue than this so-called loading mentioned by
Myd Sandwich	PERSON	and you must express our opinion to
Myd Rochford	LOCATION	.

		My letter No 127 will tell you which terms to use when you approach this Minister on this matter .

		It seems all the more necessary to convey its contents to him because of the false interpretation he gave the parliament , following the well-concerted interpellation of Lord
Lyttelton	LOCATION	.

		I rely upon your punctuality , Sir , to forward to us Md. .


Rochford	PERSON	's reply with reference to the false assertion advanced by
Myd Sandwich	PERSON	as well as our determination concerning the communication of our ships with the British Colonies .

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 20 February 1775 I have learned , My lord , that during the session of the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	where
Myd Rochford	PERSON	mentioned the letter from
Myd Stormont	LOCATION	, the Duke of
Richmond	LOCATION	said that this letter meant very little , and that one could rely upon Gallican faith only in as much as it would be to our advantage to keep our word .

		In addition , I have learned that
Myd Rochford	PERSON	was so good as to agree with this , but went on to say , however , that it would not be to our advantage if the English Colonies cast off the yoke , quoting , in order to support his opinion , the very well written but inaccurate book concerning the history of both Indies ... It is in the best interest of the Ministers not to show to the Americans the least sign of misunderstanding between us and they must be careful to keep up appearances as reality .

		I therefore confess , My lord , that I could not doubt for one moment their sincere desire to live with us according to the best of terms .

		Maintenance of peace with the outside world is the only way they can hold on ; and with the exception , perhaps , of Lord
Sandwich	PERSON	, a man as rapacious as he is capable , who believes he made himself important enough in his department so as not to lose his post should the Government collapse , I do not know any among the present Ministers who would wish war .

		Now that we are confident as to the intentions of the Ministry , since their interest as well as that of
England	LOCATION	is to maintain peace , there remains for us to examine what might be the results of the measures they took to face the situation at home .

		If these do not complete success , the administration will fall immediately , and the King will be compelled to give in to the circumstances and receive
Myd Chatham	LOCATION	at the head of the Government .

		He will come to this position with absolute power .

		His is the only name still popular in
America	LOCATION	and he will reconcile all at the moment .

		Since the rebellion of the Colonies came before his administration and , therefore , could not cast a dark shadow upon it , the former will be easily forgiven .

		Other projects will strike his genius in order to create a diversion and draw the attention away from the domestic quarrels , gather divided passions , and erase past insults with duties to come .

		He will find thousands on a war-footing in the Colonies , ten thousand regular troops , a number of ships unused and ready to serve as transports , a fleet considerable for the number of small vessels more suited to privateer , in
Europe	LOCATION	, a
Navy	ORGANIZATION	in the best condition , 17 guard-ships and 8,000 sailors .

		This is a naked sword in the hands of a madman .

		We can not overlook the fact that these are powerful motives that would rouse the ambition of a man ready to sacrifice everything to the glory of the present ; and if we consider where he might strike his first blows , we shall see a field open to vast plunder .

		Our fishermen and the elite of our sailors , would be the victims of the designs of a British squadron and , without any other protection than the good faith of this nation , the trade of our Colonies would become the prey of the British ships .

		Indeed these matters deserve the attention of the King and His Council .

		If the English policy to keep constantly cruising ships in all the seas where they have possessions is not off set by identical measures , it gives them at the onset certain advantages over us that might well destroy the fragile principles of justice , especially those of a Minister who is more famous for the fearlessness of his undertakings than the reckoning of a wise foresight .

		He would see not without impatience that everything would be ready and that three small boats carrying the necessary orders would be enough to insure the taking of 15,000 sailors and 500 ships , a flourishing
Colony	ORGANIZATION	even .

		Indeed , in these conditions , what
Colony	ORGANIZATION	would be able to resist the forces that will be gathered in
America	LOCATION	by next summer ?

		If at this time the control of the Government fell into the hands of Lord
Chatham	LOCATION	, and if six weeks later the troops ー of which he himself suggested the recall to parliament , knowing quite well they would not follow his advice ー have not received the order to come back , that circumstance alone would be sufficient , in my humble opinion , to take steps to organise our defense and use the wisest and strongest precautions .

		Fortunately , as improbable as this speculation may be , I believe , My lord , that I should present to your intelligence all the possible eventualities considering the violent situation prevailing in
England	LOCATION	now on the eve of a tremor of which the results are most unpredictable .

		Undoubtedly , nothing would be more contrary to the interests and desire of
England	LOCATION	in general than starting a war with us , even with great advantages at the onset .

		But , too often personal motives prevail over the interest of nations and the downfall of this power would not compensate the losses caused by a war we would have to carry in order to bring that destruction about .

		M. DE SARTINE , FRENCH NAVAL MINISTER , TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Paris	LOCATION	, 20 February 1775 I offer you all my thanks , Sir , for forwarding to me the dispatch from
M. Garnier	PERSON	concerning the secret branch he had the initiative to put back into operation .

		The additions that he has suggested seem to deserve all our attention .

		I know how important it is for us to be exactly informed of all English maritime movements ; I also think that we could take great advantage of the connections which
M. Garnier	PERSON	will have the opportunity to establish at
Chatam	ORGANIZATION	and in the
Office of Ordnance	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seems also greatly desirable that
M. Garnier	PERSON	should find a reliable and faithful correspondent at the Admiralty .

		If we could count on this , it would be the best way to be warned in time of the arrangements made by the British that could concern
France	LOCATION	.

		The expense that would result from this might come to a considerable amount !

		But the essential interests of the State require , especially in the present circumstances , that we do not lose from sight the projects of our rivals , whatever they may be .

		I must believe that their Colonies keep them quite busy at the moment , but if , because of some change in the Ministry anticipated by
M. Garnier	PERSON	or an agreement with the Americans , they were in the position to use for other purposes the forces which they intend to gather in the American ports , reliable advice , given in time , could upset their projects , at least stand in their way and prevent the occurence of events which , without these precautions , might become fatal to our
Navy	ORGANIZATION	and our navigation .

		RICHARD CHAMPION TO TO WILLING ,
MORRIS & CO.	ORGANIZATION	1
Gentlemen Bristol	ORGANIZATION	24 feby 1775 My last was 31 Jany Since which I have your favor of 31 Decr The remittance to Messrs Wombwells shall be soon made agreable to your directions .

		I am just return 'd from
London	LOCATION	after having had the pleasure of seeing Mr -LSB-
Edmund -RSB- Burke	PERSON	confirm 'd in his Seat by the
Committee of Elections	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most unwearied pains has been taken by that Gentleman in defence of
America	LOCATION	against the violent Measures now carrying on , and in support of the commercial Interests of both Countries , but in vain .

		All our Petitions have been treated with Contempt , and we have now no
Hope	PERSON	left .

		The Motion of Lord North which I send in the enclosed paper is not calculated at all to conciliate as the Armament is to go out , & all the
Boston Bills	ORGANIZATION	are to be enforced .

		In short every thing wears the most melancholy aspect .

		Many here speak with contempt of the firmness of
America	LOCATION	, but I can have no idea but that a people who have set out with the Resolution they have and whose Grievances have been so just , will not rather submit to temporary than lasting Evils .

		The greatest part of the large Importations of Wheat is already gone off , yet without the least Reason , they have lowered it to 6/9 p Bushel I have sold very little of the Friendship 's but she is now discharged within a trifle , but there is a good deal of damage between 3 & 400 Bushels .

		This Wheat is clean and good , but there is this great , & material Objection to it , it is between 2 & 3 Lbs P Bushel lighter than Wheat in general from
America	LOCATION	.

		This has kept back the Sale , an -LSB- d -RSB- I have sold nothing worth mentioning , & might be som -LSB- e -RSB- reason , had I been induced to it , to have lowered the price , but was none for the heavy wheat , which went off very fast , so that there is hardly any left .

		And this done after an Agreement .

		I shall not be in a hurry to sell , but will endeavour if possible to get up the price to 7 / .

		for I am sure it can not be lower than 6/9 except people will wantonly sport with their goods .

		I confirm to you what I wrote you about Wheat , & the Concerns I mentioned I have still a better opinion of this Articles ' keeping up , which the large Importations so readily selling confirm .

		Wheat will most certainly be wanted here .

		and if the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in May should put an immediate Stop to Exportation , as many suspect they will , without waiting till the 10 Sepr there will I suppose be quantities sent off as soon as possible , but as this can not I imagine affect the markets so as to raise the price , these Cargoes must turn to great Advantage .

		Whatever occurs in future I shall advise you of , but with respect to politicks I have not the least Idea , but that the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	will attempt to enforce every Act in hopes that
America	LOCATION	will give way which Lord North 's motion was particularly calculated for , thinking that it would divide the Colonies .

		I would more enlarge but I am fearful that a Vessel will be sailed as the Wind is become fair , & I could not write sooner , being just returned I am always Gentlemen -LSB- & c. -RSB- Rich Champion 1 .

London	LOCATION	Feby 24 , 1775 .

		Providence seems to have placed me here in Order to give you the earliest Intelligence of the most interesting Affairs , relative to the Colonies .

		To my great Astonishment , I have now before me an Act for blocking up the other Colonies ; & another called the Black Act , to prevent the Fisheries .

		ー The whole Nation seems to be deeply affected at such an enormous Crime , which is supposed to be done at the Request of the King and his Creatures ー God forbid , that you should be intimidated at this iniquitous Law , which is calculated to ruin what was a mutual Benefit to you and us .

		ー This must convince you what you are to expect , if you submit to the most shocking Set of Men that
England	LOCATION	can produce .

		You now see their Humanity .

		Rouse up then with a Just Indignation and exercise your Militia ー Watch your Governour and Council .

		ー The
New Assembly	ORGANIZATION	is to be composed of such Creatures as will give up the Peoples Rights , and join in the most horrid Plot against thein .

		ー What a melancholy Reflection , that the Riches and Trade of a great Nation should be abused and turned to the Destruction of themselves and the Colonies !

		In short the King is determined to be as absolute as the French King , and , with the most obstinate Head and bad Heart , has set himself against the People , whom he will not see keeping himself retired from his Subjects in Pride & Ignorance .

		He has discarded Men of Veracity from all Places of Profit & Honour , and fill 'd their offices with a Set of the most abandoned Villains on
Earth	LOCATION	.

		These are they who advised him to break his Oath with the People , for which they are dispised by the Nation .

		If you hold out a few Months ,
England	LOCATION	will rise and do you
Justice	ORGANIZATION	; as well as relieve themselves from those accursed Tyrants who want to corrupt you and deprive you of both Liberty & Property .

		ー To compleat which Villainy Lord North has made a Motion in

England	LOCATION	too .

		It is intended to defeat the salutary advice of the

		I have the pleasure to assure you , that the noble Lords with whom I have conversed , all join you in Contempt of the Junto here .

		ー You are desired to let the Colonies know that there is a deep Plot formed to divide them and deceive the People into a Compliance .

		But tell them that you want not their Trade nore Protection at the Expense of your Liberty.ー You will see , by the Papers , the Treatment Lord Chathams Plan met with .

England	LOCATION	will not let you believe the wicked Designs that are meditating against you ; but I do now , in the Presence of God warn you that the King has no good Intentions towards you , but what you oblige him , by your own Wisdom & Virtue to have .

		ー Take Care of yourselves , and act as the Wise & Brave have done in all Ages when oppressed by Tyrants .

		ー Resist unto Blood , all who attempt to betray you.ー The
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	have registered
Colden 's & Penn	ORGANIZATION	's Letters Look to them , and see for yourselves .

North	PERSON	and told him that his
Bill	PERSON	for prohibiting the Fishery was so horrid and inhumane an Act that the Nation would rise and oppose it : And that if it did pass into a Law , it would be a scandal to Humanity and perhaps occasion a Revolt .

		ー They plead two Hours with him but to no Purpose .

		The
Bill	PERSON	is to be read a third Time on Tuesday -LSB- February 28 -RSB- ; so that in five Days this horrid
Bill	PERSON	passes into a Law without any further Consideration , Oh
America	LOCATION	!

		Oh England!ー The Ministry , in Order to quiet the Mob ordered an inflammatory Pamphlet to be burnt at
Guild Hall	LOCATION	which drew off the People , whilst the
Bill	PERSON	passed in Parliament & c. A Report is sent into the City , that the Transports are stopt .

		This is to quiet the Merchants .

		But the Officers are gone down in private Coaches , of other People , and
America	LOCATION	is to be divided and driven into Compliance , before
England	LOCATION	is apprizd of it.ー Lord
North	PERSON	has just given out that he will resign , and at the same
Time	ORGANIZATION	says that he fears Nothing from the People , unless it be the breaking of his Coach Doors or some such Trifle .

		ー No Resistance of Importance from the City ; only a Clamour , which he has often experienced .

		He expects that this Manoeuvre will quiet the People on both sides of the Water .

Rex	PERSON	, and under the Protection of the Kings Troops , who are to Land them , and protect the Trade , & c.ー
North Carolina	LOCATION	is to be a store
House	ORGANIZATION	, it is said , ー Support the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, & watch the Officers of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	& c. Your Friends are afraid that you will be surprized into Compliance .

		ー The offers of Peace were only to raise the stocks which had fallen .

		ー They are now four pts higher on Account of the Report .

Council	ORGANIZATION	sat up all Night , in Order to find out
Ways and Means	ORGANIZATION	to conquer
Virginia	LOCATION	, & procure Tobacco .

		Great offers will be made to those who will raise it & c. Men of large Fortunes are afraid to oppose Government , least the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	should fail , which is said to be in Danger .

		The Interest of the Year 1774 is not paid .

		Many of the People are your most hearty Friends but the King 's your greatest Enemy .

		Be not deceived by his Low Cunning ; act wisely , and the wicked Plot will break on the Heads of those who want to destroy you .

		The King is his own Secretary ; he gets up at 6 oClock every Morning , sends off his Box with Remarks on a Bit of Paper tied round each Order .

		four of the ablest Lawyers are constantly with him , whose Business it is to advise & search for Precedents to screen his Head , and throw the Blame on the

		THOMAS &

ROBERT CARTER	PERSON	1 Sir
London	LOCATION	24th Feby 1775 Since we wrote you of 18th June last p Trident ,
Mitchell	PERSON	enclosing a
Blank Power	ORGANIZATION	of Attorney for yourself & Mr Lowndes to execute & return us , we have reced yr Letter of 21st July & observe the contents .

		We find that the # 1000
Bank Stock	ORGANIZATION	left to
Benjn Benson	PERSON	stands in the names of
Robt Carter	PERSON	,
Christr Lownds & Ann Ogle	ORGANIZATION	, for which reason a Power from them must be had for the purposes of receiving the Dividends already due thereon -LRB- of wch the Warrants for above 2 Years remain unreceived -RRB- & transferring the Stock into his name Last Summer he was attacked by an Illness which became very dangerous but he at length recover 'd of it & in the Month of October when Mr
Jas Anderson	PERSON	was about to embark for
Maryland	LOCATION	, by way of
New York	LOCATION	, he determined to accompany him .

		In consequence thereof we paid the expences of his fitting out with Cloaths & c his Passage & Cash for travelling Expences from
New York	LOCATION	& gave him the Account which amounted to # 214.15.5 -LRB- including your charge against him -RRB- ー The first Accot sent you was 3rd May 1773 beingー 70 .14 .

		These Accots we deliver 'd to Mr
Benjn Benson	PERSON	before he left
London	LOCATION	to shew how his Accot stood with us but you will observe that thro ' the whole transaction we have charged neither
Commission	ORGANIZATION	nor Interest of Money altho ' we shall at least expect the latter on his last Accot & then we are not at all benefited for having had him under our careー It appears rather singular that since you put under our Care a young Gentleman , your Consignments of Tobacco have been discontinued to us , which we apprehend must be owing to your removal from
Williamsburg	LOCATION	to
Nominy	LOCATION	hall on
Potowmack River	LOCATION	, where our Captain has not had opportunity to wait on you for yr Commands .

		We suppose that if you intended us any Tobacco , you wd have prevailed on
Messrs Hyndman & Co	ORGANIZATION	's Captain to take it on bd his Ship , as you have repeatedly done heretofore , & such a request , if denied , you wd in course advise us of , that we might take such measures as to prevent your being disappointed a second time from himー We had the misfortune , to lose our Ship
Martin	PERSON	coming from
Virginia	LOCATION	the 31st Decr last on the coast of
Wales	LOCATION	near to
Millford Haven	LOCATION	together with all the Cargo -LRB- except about 6 hhds in quantity -RRB- & Captain & 9 Men occasion 'd by the Ship getting into the
Bristol Channel	ORGANIZATION	instead of the English Channel .

		This unhappy accident & the present alarming situation of
America	LOCATION	, prevent our chartering a full Ship , we have therefore agreed with
Capta Outram	PERSON	of the Ship Liberty , who loads in
York River	LOCATION	, to take 200 hhds Tobacco for us , & we shall give him directions to wait on you on our behalf .

		He will sail the beginning of next Month for
Virginia	LOCATION	in Ballastー You will please to remember that it is incumbent on you to forward us proper Powers to enable us to reimburse ourselves , as what we have expended for
Benjn Benson	PERSON	at present stands to your Debet ー We hope he is by this time arrived in
Maryland	LOCATION	& that he will pursue some employment forthwith , having lost already too much time in doing nothing & it being out of our power by persuasion to prevail on him when here to settle in some way of Businessー We remain at all times Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB- Tho s & Rowl d Hunt .

		-LSB- P.S. -RSB- The Power B

		My Lord , Last Tuesday I had the Honor to transmit to Your Lordship a Copy of the Memorial , which from the Motive I alledged in my Dispatch No. 7 , I thought proper to present to a Deputation of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	on the 17th Instant ; And I have now the Pleasure of inclosing to You , My Lord , the Extract of Their Register , with which , in Answer thereunto ,
Syndick Sillem	LOCATION	and Senator
Dörner	PERSON	were again deputed to me Today , and which contains almost ipsissimis verbis what They were directed , They said , to signify to me orally in the Name of Their Superiors , Vizt `` That immediately upon my Memorial being read in a full
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, They had ordered the
Deputies of the Commerce	ORGANIZATION	to convoke the
Body of Merchants	ORGANIZATION	, and to notify to Them , for Their obedient Compliance the serious and earnest Prohibition The
Senate	ORGANIZATION	had just passed , to carry on any Contreband Trade whatever with or to the
British American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Deputies added , `` That , were even these Measures , tho ' calculated for debarring their Trading Inhabitants from such illegal Practices , to be deemed much too insufficient by His Majesty 's Government they should be enforced by an Edict to be immediately published and affixed for that Purpose ; '' ー And They took this Opportunity to desire me , that I would interpose my good Offices , as well in renewing the most respectful Assurances of the anxious Zeal and unlimited Devotion , which both the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and their City entertained for The King and His Government , as in conveying to His Majesty Their most ardent Wishes , that the Seeds of Discord and Opposition , scattered between the Mother and filiale-Countries , may soon be stifled or eradicated , and

		CAPTAIN
TEMPLE LUTTRELL	PERSON	IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Feb. 27 , 1775 According to the horological predictions of a most enlightened state soothsayer , we have about seven years more of profound tranquillity with the
House of Bourbon	ORGANIZATION	to trust to ; but , from the symptoms of our domestic distraction , and the improved state of the government and finances of our neighbours , I should judge it prudent to be somewhat better provided than we are at present for an early rupture ; not entirely to dismantle our ports and our coasts of soldiers and seamen , sent to immolate the martyrs to liberty of their own flesh and blood , on the distant continent of
America	LOCATION	.

		It has been made evident to you , that a defection of the northern colonies will soon bring on the complete ruin of your
West India	LOCATION	settlements , which can not elsewhere affordably provide themselves with cattle , lumber , and divers other articles requisite for the support of a plantation .

		... Whatsoever share of indulgence and independency
Great Britain	LOCATION	shall , in this her florid and athletic stage , generously bestow on her rising colonies , they will , no doubt , amply repay to her in some future generation ... 1 .

		CIRCULAR LETTER OF
JAMES RUSSELL	PERSON	, A
LONDON	LOCATION	MERCHANT , TO HIS CORRESPONDENTS IN
MARYLAND	LOCATION	AND
VIRGINIA	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir ,
London	LOCATION	, February , 1775 It is with the greatest Concern I find myself under the Necessity of informing you , that the present alarming State of Affairs will no longer justify my entertaining Hopes that our Trade will be restored to its former Situation , by the Requisitions of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	being duly attended to and complied with in this Session of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	; the
Association	ORGANIZATION	must , consequently , be strictly adhered to .

		In Compliance therefore with the first Resolution thereof , and circumstanced as we now are by the violent Resolutions of Government , I have laid aside all Thoughts of being able this Spring to execute the conditional Orders for Goods , sent me by many of my Friends last Fall .

		Under the Faith of the
Fourth Resolution of the Association	ORGANIZATION	, I have ventured to send my Ships out in Ballast , in Confidence , that by the favour of my steady Friends , they will return loaded with Tobacco , consigned to me as usual ; and I have strictly enjoined all the Masters of Ships in my Service , to pay due regard to the Sixth Resolution of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	, on Pain of forfeiting all future Employment by me .

		The tender Regard paid to the Interests of the Merchants of this Country , by the Continuation of Exports from
America	LOCATION	for a limited Time , after our Friends there have precluded themselves the Benefits and Conveniencies of all Imports from hence , is an Instance of Favour to them , for which they will not be ungrateful ; and I take this Opportunity of acknowledging the due Sence I have of the particular Advantages that will result to me from the Justice of this Resolution ; the Wisdom of it is highly extolled by all the
Friends of America	ORGANIZATION	, because it puts it in their Power to refute the Calumnies of such as have insinuated , that Intentions were formed by some of withholding the Debts due from the Colonies to
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Impressed with the deepest Anxiety for the grievous Distress with which not only the Colonies , but these Kingdoms , are threatened , the Merchants of this City have not upon this Occasion been wanting in Duty to their Country , their Friends , themselves , and Posterity , by using every justifiable Means in their Power , to prevent the Calamities with which all are threatened ; and if they have hitherto been unsuccessful , they are not discouraged , but will continue to take every Opportunity that may offer of using their utmost Endeavours to obtain Relief for their Fellow-Subjects in
America	LOCATION	, and to establish
Concord	ORGANIZATION	and a permament and cordial Reconciliation between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her Colonies , upon which the future Prosperity of both ultimately depend ; and they have Reason to hope that these great Objects are still to be attained .

		I flatter myself , that notwithstanding all the Insinuations of the Malevolent or Interested , a Doubt has not been entertained by any of my Friends , of my Readiness to concur in every Measure that shall appear expedient to the general Body of Merchants and Traders , to be taken in
Favour of America	LOCATION	: a Moment 's Reflection must carry Conviction with it to every disinterested Person , that the
Prosperity of America	ORGANIZATION	is evidently so intimately connected with my own Interest , that a Suspicion can not remain , that I could recommend or adopt Measures destructive in their Consequences to my best Friends , and ruinous to myself .

		I also flatter myself , that the same Spirit of Unanimity with which the whole Trade here are disposed to adopt every Measure tending to the general Good , will be communicated to their respective Friends with you ; and that however fashionable it may have been to depreciate the Reputation of one , with a View to exalt the Credit and promote the Interest of another , that such illiberal Practices will henceforth be exploded , and all Animosities cease ; this , at least , is my earnest Wish ; Calumny and Detraction have never had my Sanction ; and I trust , that my Business , which has so long been established upon a better Foundation , does not now require the Aid of so weak a Support .

		I acknowledge that I have always been willing to promote a laudable Spirit of Emulation in the Trade , in Hopes that the obvious Benefits resulting to my Correspondents from such a Conduct , would be attended with good Consequences to my own Interest .

		It has been suggested to me , by some my Wellwishers , that they were not without Apprehensions that it would be dangerous to put any of their Property in the
Power of Government	ORGANIZATION	, by shipping it to
Great Britain	LOCATION	during the Existence of the present Troubles ; I therefore think it incumbent upon me , before I solicit the Favour of their Consignments , to undertake , which I hereby do , to indemnify all my Friends from any Risk they may apprehend their Effects consigned to me will be liable to after their Arrival here .

		Upon Application to Mr.
Charles Grahame	PERSON	,
Merchant	ORGANIZATION	, at
Lower Marlborough	ORGANIZATION	; Mr.
John Dorsey	PERSON	, Merchant , at
Elkridge	LOCATION	; or
Philip Richard Fendall	PERSON	, Esq ; at
Port Tobacco	ORGANIZATION	, who have the Direction of loading my Ships , the fullest Satisfaction may be had that I have Property sufficient in the Country to warrant this Engagement , and guaranty all my Transactions .

		The Assurances I have received from many of my Correspondents , who now owe me Balances , that no public Dissensions will influence them to forget their Duty to Individuals , give me Reason to expect that they will , upon this Occasion , exert themselves to make me all the Remittances in their Power , by the Return of the Ships .

		I do not wish to draw more of my Property out of the Province , than will discharge every just Demand that can be made upon me here ; and that I have not the least Doubt of being enabled to compleat .

		And should public Affairs continue to exhibit the melancholy Prospect of a total Stagnation of Trade , and consequently deprive us of the Means of promoting and continuing our Friendship and Correspondence for any Length of Time , I have no longer any Incitement to reside here , and I doubt not but many of my Friends will be glad to see me in the worst of
Times	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Produce of the real Property I have in the Country , will enable me to spend the last Stage of a Life amongst them , which has been so long dedicated to promoting a mutually beneficial commercial Intercourse with the
Tobacco Colonies	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is impossible to say what Prices Tobacco may command at this Market next Fall : that will greatly depend upon the Prospect we may have of a Continuation of a Supply from the Colonies , and in some Measure upon the Steps that are likely to be taken here in American Affairs , in the next Session of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	; and it is yet to be hoped , that they will be favourable to the Restoration of our Trade , because by that
Time	ORGANIZATION	our Rulers must feel that this Country has every Thing to lose , and no Advantage to hope for , by this unnatural Contest with their own Subjects .

		This is certain , that the Sellers will struggle to maintain inflexibly the present high Prices , and take every Advantage of the State of the Market , and of the Apprehensions of the Buyers that the Means of Supply will be cut off , to advance them still higher .

		I beg Leave to recommend it to you , to get your Tobacco ready as early as possible , that you may run no Risk of being disappointed in getting it shipped off before the Period fixed for the Termination of Exports .

		The Favour of your Assistance to dispatch my Ships , will be doubly esteemed as an Obligation this Year ; and you may rest assured of my
Fidelity	ORGANIZATION	, and that I shall consider your Interest as my own , in the Disposal of whatever you are pleased to commit to my Care at this critical Juncture .

		LETTER FROM
LONDON	LOCATION	RECEIVED BY THE COMMITTEE OF NEW YORK 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB-
London	LOCATION	-RSB- March 1 , 1775 Part of the Troops now Orderd for Embarkation here and
Ireland	LOCATION	, are to rendezvous at
New York	LOCATION	, to make it a Place of Arms securing the Defection of that Province from the general Alliance in the
Cause of Freedom	ORGANIZATION	, and every Thing that is dear to Man : and to prevent the Communication between
Virginia	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	, and the other
Southern Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, with
New England	LOCATION	, when General -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	with such Assistance as he may get from
New York	LOCATION	, is to subdue those Colonies by a Garrison and Place of Arms , with the
Assistance of Quebeck	ORGANIZATION	to rule with a Rod of Iron all the Slaves of
America	LOCATION	.

		Without the Concurrance of new York , this Scheme can never be carried into Execution , of which every Gentleman and Man of Knowledge in the
Kingdom	LOCATION	is fully convinced therefore on your Virtue , in a great Measure , it depends whether
America	LOCATION	shall be free , or be reduced to the most abject and oppressive Servitude ; worse than that of Egyptian Bondage ; in which you must inevitably be involved , if you lend your Aid to enslave your Brethern in the other Colonies .

		I have to inform you that the Bill for preventing the four Colonies and Provinces of
New England	LOCATION	from Fishing , getting any Provisions from the other Colonies , carrying on any Commerce whatsoever to any Part of the World , except to
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	or the British
West Indies	LOCATION	will finally pass the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	to morrow , and is to take place the first of next July .

		ー You may also depend that in a few Days another
Bill	PERSON	will be brought in to prohibit any of the other Colonies from carrying on any Trade whatever with each other , or to any other part of the World , except to
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, or the British

America	LOCATION	.

		The troops are designed to embark from
Ireland	LOCATION	in all this month but they will hardly get to

New York	LOCATION	, for tho ' the

Wentworth	LOCATION	relative to the riotous proceedings in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, and giving an account of the steps you had taken thereupon , as also of your proceedings up to the date of your Letter ; and in return I am to acquaint you that their Lordships very well approve thereof .

Andrew -RSB- Barkley	PERSON	and Lieutenant -LSB-

		Their Lordships approve of your having landed the Supernumerary Marines belonging to the Ships under your Command upon the requisition of General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, and of your having discharged them from the Ships Books , it corresponding exactly with their Lordships directions to you of the 28th of January , of which you will receive a Duplicate by this Conveyance .

		Their Lordships being apprehensive that the Contractors for Victualling His Majesty 's Ships in

Victualling Board	ORGANIZATION	to send out to you upon Freight 4 Months Provisions of all species for 4275 Men , that you may , as you shall see occasion , be enabled to send supplies to such of the Ships under your Command as may stand in need thereof .

		The

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 My Lord ,
London	LOCATION	, 3 March 1775 I have the honor to inform you at the request of
Mylord Rochford	LOCATION	that , as a result of the protests I made in your name to this Minister , the Court of
London	LOCATION	deeming this matter important enough to take new precautions , has sent with dispatch to its sea officers on duty in
America	LOCATION	the most positive orders to use the greatest care in avoiding to give us the smallest ground for complaint .

		I believe it is my duty to forward to you also the most positive assurance I have received since then from
Mylord Sandwich	PERSON	and
Mylord Suffolk	LOCATION	in this matter .

		Both have confirmed to me in the strongest terms that all the orders we might have wished for have just been given not to interfere with the navigation of our ships under any pretence .

		In brief , all the ministers have assured me that they were perfectly at ease at present and that we certainly would not have any reason to complain .

		It is not possible , My lord , to carry guarantees any further and give them a more sincere and persuasiye accent .

		Indeed , I confess that I have not the slightest doubt that we can rely absolutely upon them .

		I made the remark to
Mylord Suffolk	LOCATION	that our foresight in this respect is a convincing proof of our good intentions and our endeavour to avoid as much as it is within our power any ground for dispute between us .

		This minister answered me that he had interpreted our request only in this sense and that he was obliged to us .

		It was agreed that we would have behaved quite differently if it had been our intention to take advantage of our neighbours ' embarrassing situation .

		Indeed , My lord , you will have rendered an essential service to both Nations by this act of caution at a time when one could not give too much attention in holding back officers whose ideas lean naturally toward war and booty and would become inflamed by reason of the operations of which they will have charge .

		The only reproach these ministers might incur is that they waited to take these measures , as important to them as they are to us , until we brought the need to their attention .

		But in their position , it is difficult to think of everything ; and their intentions are so peaceful that it never came to their minds to suspect those of their subordinates .

		I had one more order from you to carry , My lord : that one consisting in the denial of the assertion relative to so-called French ships being loaded at Fort l'Orient for the English Colonies .

		I asked
Mylord Sandwich	PERSON	yesterday if he had presented this assertion to the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	.

		He admitted so .

		Whereupon I explained to him the nature of my orders ; that I believed I should warn him in complete honesty that I could not exempt myself from carrying them out .

		He told me that he had received this reliable information from l'Orient and from
Bordeaux	LOCATION	and that it had been confirmed to him by the
London	LOCATION	underwriters ; that , anyway , it was a speculation on the part of our merchants occupied in smuggling and not a State affair .

		I answered that we did not consider either this matter as such ; and that , since no question on this matter had been put to us , we wished to express our conviction out of pure friendship that he most certainly had been poorly informed .

		Today , I also spoke of this to Lord
Suffolk	PERSON	who attaches no importance to this affair .

		He told me that you had said in jest to their Ambassador that
Mylord Sandwich	PERSON	was not well informed by his spies .


Mylord Suffolk	LOCATION	assured me also at the meeting we had yesterday that
Mr Shuldham	PERSON	, former Governor of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, had deemed equitable the statement of losses by our fishermen , such as I presented it and that this affair would be settled at any moment to my satisfaction and according to my desire , At the point where we stand now , I was to expect the fairness of this procedure , the only one that could be consistent with the manner in which they recognised and confessed on their own the misbehavior on the part of a few of their fishermen .

		I took this opportunity to mention the essential point concerning a new agreement on the distribution of the coastline where we fish .

		I presented the same arguments as those I reported in my letter of 1 July of last year , No. 206 .

		Since they had been approved then , and since this letter describes in detail the aspects of the problem concerning fishing in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, I beg you ,
Mylord	LOCATION	, to have it presented to you again .

		It might influence you to give me more specific instructions in this regard .


Mylord Suffolk	PERSON	advised me that he did not think it was impossible to come to a certain agreement before the new Governor , who has just been appointed , leaves for
Newfoundland	LOCATION	; however , the tremendous amount of work at the Ministery would prevent it at this very moment .

		One of Lord
North	PERSON	's friends took the initiative to relate to him my observations on the eleventh paragraph of his
Bill	PERSON	.

		I am told that he listened with the greatest attention .

		We will soon see the results .

		After what I have heard , especially the explanations given by the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of the City Merchants at the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, I am inclined to believe that the fishing interdiction concerning the New Englanders will not go into effect this year yet .

		These explanations seemed to be interesting enough that I should bring them to your attention .

		I enclose a translation in this letter .

		The province of
New York	LOCATION	answered the Government 's expectations .

		You will see , My lord , the speech delivered by the Governor of this province at the opening of the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		A member having suggested to consider before anything else the resolutions of the general
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, this motion was rejected by the majority of one voice only .

		I took the liberty to tell
Mylord Suffolk	LOCATION	that this one voice was worth one million in pounds Sterling .

		The
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, therefore , decided to search for other ways by which to redress its grievances .

		It further decided unanimously to present a petition to His British Majesty , a memorandum to the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	and a remonstrance to the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		The contents of these documents , which have not arrived yet , will show the ministers how far they can depend on the intentions of this Colony which occupies a very advantageous position in as much as it forms a vital link in the line of communications between
New England	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		However , since several Committees assembled in various parts of the Province have agreed to conform exactly to the resolutions of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	jointly with the other ten Colonies belonging to it , the Government will send four regiments to the Province of
New York	LOCATION	in order to protect and encourage those who display their good intentions and have themselves asked for troops .

		Since I had not received the authorization to request the orders sent recently to the Commodore of the
English Squadron	ORGANIZATION	concerning our ships , I refrained from doing it of my own initiative .

		Furthermore , I confess I deem them to be so favorable that the ministers might fear to expose themselves to an accusation of timidity by showing them to us in their entirety .

		I am , respectfully , & c.
Garnier	PERSON	1 .

LEWIS DE VISME	ORGANIZATION	, BRITISH ENVOY TO
SWEDEN	LOCATION	, TO LORD SUFFOLK 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Stockholm 3d March 1775 I had the Honor of Your Lordships Letter of the 7th February , and I lost no time in acquainting Count
Scheffer	PERSON	with the Instructions given to the Commanders of His Majestys Ships and Vessels on the North-American Station .

		He said that the precautions were just and wise , and that , I might depend upon it , no Swedish Vessels would be found in those Seas ; but I observed , that though the Swedes should not trade on their own account , they might possibly receive freights from others .

		In order therefore the better to secure their Shipping and Effects from accidents , I have circulated this advice among the principal Merchants of the Capital , and of

		RICHARD CHAMPION TO TO WILLING ,
MORRIS & CO.	ORGANIZATION	1
Gentlemen Bristol	ORGANIZATION	6 March 1775 My Last was 24 Ulto Since I have none of your favours .

		The News from
New York	LOCATION	, since strengthend by the Testimony of the
Quakers	ORGANIZATION	in your Province , leave no doubt with most people -LRB- of which I confess myself to be one of the number -RRB- of the Submission of all
America	LOCATION	to the present System of Government in this Kingdom .

		It is a pity , that these Circumstances had not been duly considered , before the Americans determined upon meeting in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the resolutions of which by being broke through , only confirms the opinion already adopted , of the weakness of the American Counsels .

		I am still of the same opinion , whatever may be the Event , that these Laws of Taxation were impolitick and illegal , that they are subversive of the constitutional Liberty of the Subject , and will in the end be destructive of the present Constitution .

		And I am still further of opinion , that had the Colonies been united in a firm compact to resist these Laws , it was not in the power of the Mother Country to have compelled her .

		It is a fact that since
America	LOCATION	has been in a State of Resistance , great Confusion has reigned in the Councils of the Ministry .

		When the violent and oppressive Acts passed against
Boston	LOCATION	last May , the Ministry placed the strongest dependance upon the other Colonies not supporting her , and when he found that they had determined upon a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, he laughed at it & looked upon an Union as a thing absurd and impossible In this Situation the new
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	met , when the
Kings Speech	ORGANIZATION	was couched in warm terms against
America	LOCATION	.

		But no sooner was the resolution of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	known , & the union with which their determination was made , than the Minister was really frighten 'd , & expressed himself to that purpose in the
House	ORGANIZATION	before the Adjournment .

		However there being a little time to breathe before the parliament met , the most violent of the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	declared themselves openly against
America	LOCATION	the danger being distant .

		Again the News from
Virginia	LOCATION	threw them into Confusion , & produced a delusive but apparently conciliatory motion from the Minister , but with such a variety of Opinion in his Coleagues or his Superiours , that they had nearly quarrelled .

		Now the News from -LSB-
New -RSB- York	LOCATION	has raised their Spirits , & they talk of a Bill to shut up the
Ports of Virginia & Carolina	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Act to restrain the Fisheries , or in other words to starve the four
New England Provences	LOCATION	still goes on .

		But if there is any wisdom in the Ministry they will now as some Provinces have acceded , & the others must , adopt moderate Measures , in order to produce some degree of reconciliation and fix their revenue System on a settled basis .

		The Advocates for
America	LOCATION	of which there are able ones in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, tho ' few in number , receive now in a pretty extensive degree , the Epithets of factious , and rediculous .

		To suppose there was Virtue enough left in
America	LOCATION	to produce any firmness , they are stiled rediculous and for the
Resistance	ORGANIZATION	which
America	LOCATION	has made , they are stiled factious as having caused it .

		Our Representative Mr -LSB-
Edmund -RSB- Burke	PERSON	has indeed exerted himself in the Cause of the Colonies with a warmth , which becomes the dignity of his publick , & the honesty of his private Character , and however wanting any of the Americans may have been in support of their own Cause , Every Man who appeared in their defence here , was supporting in their persons the Liberties of the whole Empire , which can not be constitutionally taxed without the Consent of the people or their Representatives , & if a Revenue is found in
America	LOCATION	, will only be used to strengthen the enormous power of the Crown by adding to the List Placemen and Pensioners .

		As for us poor Traders who have dared to express our Sentiments in favour of the Colonies , we have the Comfort not only of being called factious , but also of being called fools for our Interference with a Business , which did not belong to us , for that the Business of a Merchant is his Interest only , which he ought to prefer to every other Consideration , & which we were by our Encouragement to
America	LOCATION	evidently injuring by an Interruption of our Commerce .

		Indeed I am convinced , that Interest is the Soul of Traders in general , & that this will put an end to the resistance of
America	LOCATION	upon publick and vertuous principles .

		However I shall ever be happy to have an Opportunity of saying that a
House	ORGANIZATION	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the greatest perhaps in
Europe	LOCATION	led the way , by an entire sacrifice of its private Interest , to the publick Advantage , and founded an Opposition which had it been strictly adhered to would have saved Posterity from the miseries of an arbitrary Government , which this Nation is hastening to assure and for which the Introduction of a Revenue System in
America	LOCATION	, will prove a certain ground work .

		I have not made much progress in the Sale of the Friendship 's Cargo of Wheat .

		It is clean and good white Wheat , but this quality if not so much liked here being light , & not producing the quantity of Flour .

		Indeed our Consumption in this part of the Country is almost wholly of red Wheat , as they are much heavier and produce more flour .

		So that these sorts of Wheat will have the preference .

		However I do as others do here engage the weight to be 60 pounds P Bushel & will not go under 6/9 P Bushel .

		I have no doubt of finishing the sale at that price only I must wait a little patiently Some of the Black princes Cargo 2 have been sold at 6/7 1/2 warranted Colds P Bushel which somewhat affected the market However I shall not lower I am determined if there is the least possibility of supporting the price , which I am sure may be done with great Ease , for there was no manner of occasion for lowering the price from 7 / as the demand would have been the same .

		As a proof of it , of the great Quantity imported the greatest part is sold by far , notwithstanding the floods & bad weather which impeded the Country Navigation .

		The Weather is extremely bad , & there is no doubt of the Corn 's being greatly injured , & indeed every prospect of a middling Harvest , so that this Country must be in want of grain .

		I have given you my sentiments fully on that Article , which I confirm with respect to want of it here .

		Had not the Supplies we have had , arrived , Wheat must have been 12 / p Bushel at the least .

		With respect to Export in future you will know best , but by the appearances of things I suppose it will now be open .

		The Manufacturers are fuller of work then Naught could have thought especially at
Norwich Manchester &	ORGANIZATION	in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	, & even at
Birmingham	LOCATION	there is a good Trade , nor are the Clothing Countrees yet affected .

		The principal Distress lies with the
Nail Duffield & Serge Manufacturers	ORGANIZATION	who are already great Sufferers .

		I shall advise you what further occurs for I am with great Truth Gentlemen -LSB- & c -RSB- .

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 6 March 1775 After the recent increase of the troops and of the ships , I thought , My lord , that in the present circumstances , you would like to receive a record of the armed forces and everything in active status in the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		In writing both reports , I took care to show clearly and precisely the disposition of the British forces as of next May .

		I thought I should anticipate and include the troops on their way to
America	LOCATION	as well as the frigates and corvettes being readied for the same destination .

		If no changes occur between now and that time , the entire forces bound for
America	LOCATION	will consist of 14,635 infantry men and 1200 marines under the orders of General
Gage	PERSON	; also , 7 ships-of-the-line , 16 frigates , 18 corvettes , 7 schooners , with crews totaling 7600 men .

		All these ships are assigned to the waters of
Northern America	LOCATION	as well as the waters of the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		The transport ships chartered by the
Navy Department	ORGANIZATION	for the passage of 7 infantry regiments , 1 light Cavalry regiment and 700 marines under orders to go to
America	LOCATION	, form a total of 17,345 tons .

		If we found ourselves in the same unfortunate situation as
England	LOCATION	, and if we had forces as large as hers in this part of the world , I dare say that
England	LOCATION	, without any consideration for the legitimacy of our motives or the sincerity of our promises , would seek safety with her own means , and we would soon see her squadrons in all her possessions , ready to protect them against any event .

		What would
England	LOCATION	not do to help bring about the independance of our colonies in rebellion ?

		We are undoubtedly less suspicious and more righteous , but after the experience of the past ,
England	LOCATION	can expect that we will take , for our own part , the precautions that the King will deem necessary .

		This power should not be surprised if , in similar conjuncture , we relied entirely upon her good faith .

		The Ministry may change and it is advisable that the successors do not find us without defense .

		Furthermore , I see that , among the most reasonable Englishmen , a certain number expect the King to have by next summer a squadron cruising for the protection of His colonies and the trade of His subjects .

		It has been clearly explained to me that , if we wished to protect the American fishermen in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, we would have all of them on our side , and that these people could form with
France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	an alliance so much the stronger that it would rest on their mutual interests .

		Since the suggestion came from a man of distinguished merit and for whom an immediate answer was required all the more because he wanted on the contrary that I take some time to think about it , I did not hesitate to reply that it was not a feasible thing .

		I beg you , My lord , to impute these observations only to my zeal .

		By submitting them to your intelligence , I beg you to remain assured that I profess no other opinions than your own to which I am bound by my feelings and my sense of duty .

		We have received the information from
Holland	LOCATION	that the English Ambassador has requested the States General to stop all vessels of their nation from carrying arms and war ammunition to the English Colonies , and should they fail to do so ,
Great Britain	LOCATION	would send warships to
Texel	ORGANIZATION	,
Zealand	LOCATION	and the mouth of the
Meuse	LOCATION	in order to visit Dutch ships .

		You can , My lord , compare this to the language we are used to hear and you will see that weakness towards
England	LOCATION	is like an enemy that becomes worse and worse as it becomes easier to punish him .

		I have the honor to forward to you along with the American papers as they were presented to the Parliament an abstract of these papers made by Mr.
Frontier	PERSON	.

		2 This correspondence does not flatter General
Gage	PERSON	, for it shows clearly the sterility of his information as well as his means and views .

		It would be easy to verify that , on various occasions , several persons here were better informed of what actually went on in
America	LOCATION	and what was to come than General
Gage	PERSON	himself who was there and in possession of the greatest civilian and military powers .

		At present , he begins to be regarded with more favor and it is believed that he will not be deprived of the command that General
Amherst	LOCATION	could have had if he had wished .

		Everything is being readied on the American continent for the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that is to take place on the tenth of May .


Georgia	LOCATION	which had not been represented at the last congress has elected a few representatives for the next one .

		The delegates of the other colonies will be nearly the same as those who fulfilled this mission last year .

		It is also believed that
New York	LOCATION	will again send delegates , and that the refusal on the part of the legal Assembly of this province to take into consideration the resolutions of the last
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will remain without consequences .

		It is true that the provincial congress appointed to carry out the said resolutions acts still as unanimously as in the past , and that , according to the latest news from this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, it had been decided to send back with her cargo a ship expected there any day from the port of
London	LOCATION	.

		Furthermore , the petitions expected from the assembly will be far from conforming to the desires of the government .

		Be it as it may , this sort of apparent defection on the part of the assembly is , it seems to me , an unfortunate occurence as far as the other colonies are concerned and the government must not neglect anything in order to draw the greatest advantage from it .

		The first summer months will apparently bring about in
America	LOCATION	important events the repercussion of which we will soon feel ... The order has just been given for the building at
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	of a ship of 90 guns under the name of Glory .

		You can rely , My lord , on my taking every opportunity to inform you of what goes on here .

		The state of things here becomes so interesting every day that it requires our greatest vigilance and care .

		I neglect nothing in order to be able to forward to you the most reliable informations and my connections are such that I can obtain them .

		Nothing interesting happened in either
House	ORGANIZATION	since my last letter .

		COUNT DE VERGENNES TO
M. GARNIER	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Versailles	LOCATION	, 9 March 1775 I have already told you , Sir , that we have good reason to be satisfied with Md. .


Rochford	PERSON	's explanations concerning the orders given to the British ships which are cruising on the coast of the English Colonies of
America	LOCATION	; we could wish for nothing more in this matter , except that these orders be precise enough so as to contain the greed of the captains to whom they are addressed : it is in the interest of the
British Ministry	ORGANIZATION	as well as ours , and this consideration reassures me as much as their statements , if not more so .

		But while we may rest at ease with respect to the trade and navigation of our Colonies , we have every reason for expecting disagreeable incidents in the area of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	; indeed , the English will avail themselves of the
Bill	PERSON	recently passed for the purpose of restricting the fishing rights of the Colonies in this area in order to visit , harass , and probably ransack our fishermen on the pretence that they are smuggling ; you will be so kind , Sir , as to invite Md. .


Rochford	PERSON	's attention to these drawbacks ; they should convince this minister that the clause upon which they are contingent could have been omitted , all the more because it is in itself completely useless and because it is open to a false interpretation which will become a source of countless chicaneries and quarrels between the fishermen of both nations : we deem these considerations to be so important that they can not fail to impress the British
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	; unfortunately this evil appears to be beyond remedy .

		It is to the same purpose that I discussed this matter with Lord
Stormont	ORGANIZATION	; he seemed to agree with my observations and I believe that he will present them favorably to his Court .

		It is difficult , Sir , to guess what motives prompted Lord
North	PERSON	to bring forth his last motion at the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		I suspect that this minister may have had two reasons : first , to get himself out of a difficulty ; second , to deceive the Americans .

		However , it is to be feared that it was a miscalculation on his part , for , as Mr
Fox	PERSON	observed most appropriately , it would be difficult to convince the Colonies that the Government wishes in good faith to give way and come to agreement with them , and , at the same time , have the English believe that the metropolitan authority and the acts of parliament will be upheld .

		This contradiction points to the division among the ministers , the uncertainty of their projects and of their views ; it allows us to foresee the fall of the present ministry and
Md Chatham	ORGANIZATION	's triumph .

		Of course , this last event would bring about a new order of things , and it is much to be feared that it would be at the sacrifice of peace in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		We are not supposed to know what goes on in the English parliament , but since the public papers have mentioned them , there can be no objection to our withstanding the false imputations and fabricated reports uttered in that place and which seek to gain credence : Md. .

		Sandwich puts forth such imputations when he says that we are loading ships for
America	LOCATION	at l'Orient ; you will be so kind as to deny this to Lord
Rochford	PERSON	, not officially but in private ; should we keep silent in this matter the facts would be assumed to be correct and since the ships suposedly destined for
America	LOCATION	would not leave , the British might believe that we changed our mind in this respect out of fear and weakness .

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 10 March 1775 The Bill intended to restrict the trade of
New England	LOCATION	and prevent the latter from fishing on the Banks of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	or along the coast of
Northern America	LOCATION	was passed the day before yesterday with a majority of 188 voices against 58 at the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		This
Bill	PERSON	sets 1 July of this year as the date when the interdiction will go into effect for the New Englanders to export any kind of goods to any parts of the world except the possessions of the British Empire , either in the
West Indies	LOCATION	or in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		As of the first of September , any ship loaded outside
Great Britain	LOCATION	and carrying any goods whatever to
New England	LOCATION	will be subject to seizure either in the ports of this province , or at a limit of six miles from her coast .

		Exception is made for horses , food supplies , and cloth made in
Ireland	LOCATION	and coming directly from that
Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		On 20 July the order will go into effect to seize any
New England	LOCATION	ship found fishing on the Banks of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, along the coast of
Labrador	LOCATION	, the coast of the gulf and river
Saint Lawrence	PERSON	,
Cape Breton	LOCATION	, and
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, or , finally , along any coast of
Northern America	LOCATION	.

		Exception is made only for the inhabitants of the small Island of
Nantucket	LOCATION	who , although dependant upon
New England	LOCATION	, retain their freedom to fish for reasons cited by the
Committee of the Merchants of London	ORGANIZATION	which I had the honor to forward to you .

		One modification has also been added for whale fishing , and it is specified that any ship that will have sailed exclusively for this purpose before 1 June will be free to engage in whale fishing until the first of November of this year ... The Lords will take this
Bill	PERSON	into consideration next week .

		Although a strong opposition is expected on the part of Lord
Chatham	LOCATION	, the latter will have another opportunity to express his disapproval , since Lord
North	PERSON	has requested and received permission yesterday to present a new
Bill	PERSON	in order to restrict the trade of the following Colonies :
New Jersey	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, and
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		The trade of these five colonies will therefore be confined to
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	and the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		At present , it might be interesting for us to know that
Carolina	LOCATION	will no longer be able to export rice to several foreign ports ... This Minister -LRB- Lord
Rochford	PERSON	-RRB- spoke to me of the threats made to the Dutch .

		He even said to me that the Government had presently two warships cruising off
Texel	ORGANIZATION	in order to intercept three merchantmen upon which he received some information and which he claims are loaded with ammunition for the Colonies .

		Although they are officially bound for
Saint Eustatius	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	does not believe this Island needs any ammunition .

		As for the assertion made by the first Lord of the Admiralty concerning some ships supposedly loaded at Port l'Orient for the English Colonies ,
Myd Rochford	PERSON	told me he would not fail to chaff Myd Sandwich about it .

		DEBATES IN THE BRITISH HOUSE OF LORDS 1 Thursday , March 16 , 1775 -LSB- Sir
Charles Pratt	PERSON	-RSB- Lord
Camden	LOCATION	rose and said ... Now , my Lords , whether the proposed measure of severity 2 be practicable or not , is also most seriously deserving of your lordships ' attention .

		To conquer a great continent of 1800 miles , containing three millions of people , all indissolubly united on the great Whig bottom of liberty and justice , seems an undertaking not to be rashly engaged in .

		It is said by a noble lord -LRB-
Dudley	PERSON	-RRB- that only our mildness and lenity save them from utter desolation , and prevent our carrying fire and sword through their country .

		But I believe it is certain that we would have done so , if we could ; and that nothing but inability has prevented our proceeding to the most hostile extremes of violence and devastation ; if we may judge from what has been done in that line , in which alone any thing can hope to be effected .

		But , my lords , where are you to get men and money adequate to the service and expence that the reduction of such a continent must require ?

		What are the 10,000 men you have just voted out to
Boston	LOCATION	?

		Merely to save General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	from the disgrace and destruction of being sacked in his entrenchments .

		It is obvious , my lords , that you can not furnish armies , or treasure , competent to the mighty purpose of subduing
America	LOCATION	.

		It is obvious that your only effort can be by your naval power ; and , as far as those efforts can have effect , you may certainly expect success : at least when we consider
America	LOCATION	alone : but whether
France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	will be tame , inactive , spectators of your efforts and distractions , is well worthy the considerations , of your lordships .

		But admitting full success to your naval efforts , what can they effect ; the blocking up their ports and the suppression of their trade .

		But will this procure the conquest of
America	LOCATION	?

		No , my lords ; they are prepared to meet these severities , and to surmount them .

		Greeting : Be it known that We , for particular Reasons Us thereunto moving , have thought fit absolutely to prohibit , and We hereby absolutely do prohibit , all Exportation of Ammunition , Gunpowder , Guns , and Shot , by Ships belonging to the Dominions of

		That We have further thought fit to enact , and We do hereby enact , that during the abovesaid Term of Six Months , no Gunpowder , Guns , Shot , or other Instruments of War , shall be embarked on

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 20 March 1775 No ships are being readied for the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	at this moment in any English port .

		The merchants would be the first to know if there were any hostile preparations against the
Dey	PERSON	of
Algiers	LOCATION	, and the Government gives no indications to that effect .

		When this African Prince refused to receive the British Consul last year , the British Ministers confessed to me that , in spite of the importance of this wrong , they would not wage war against the
Dey	PERSON	unless he incited a necessary revenge with new insults .

		Such a war would not be worth the trouble .


Myd Rochford	PERSON	expressed this view and added that they would be content to leave the
Dey	PERSON	in doubt about the intentions of the British Court ... I informed you by mistake that the inhabitants of the Island of
Nantucket	LOCATION	were not included in the Bill that deprives
New England	LOCATION	of fishing in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		They retain only the right to whale fishing , and it can be surmised that the Government intends even to take away from the Americans their fishing rights in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	completely and for ever , as you may have seen in the abstract of the sessions of the fifteenth and sixteenth of this month at the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, with the hope that the British
Navy	ORGANIZATION	will benefit more from it .

		Furthermore , it is not in good faith that
Myd Sandwich	PERSON	dared hold forth that American sailors are not used in the Royal navy .

		It has been proved that about 30,000 of them were spent in the last war .

		Even if it were not true that they are most usefully employed in the fleet at times of war , it would remain a fact that by providing men for the indispensable merchant ships , they leave the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	with much larger resources in finding crews for its warships among the British sailors ... One speaks a great deal about two British ships cruising off
Texel	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Minister from
Denmark	LOCATION	seems much concerned about it and fears apparently that ships will also be sent to the
Straits	LOCATION	of the
Sund	PERSON	.

		However , the other foreign Ministers are not surprised that the Republic is so pusillanimous as to suffer such an insult and it would be rather embarrassing for the British government if the Dutch , in spite of their weakness , decided to give them chase ; but it seems that the British
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	knows with whom they are dealing .

		The Count of
Maltzahn	PERSON	, Minister from
Prussia	LOCATION	, claims that one of the British ships had visited a Dutch vessel loaded with goods for
America	LOCATION	as she came out of
Texel	ORGANIZATION	; he reports that no war ammunitions whatever were found on board , only papers sent from
London	LOCATION	to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The corvettes Nautilus and
Merlin	PERSON	sailed from
Spithead	LOCATION	successively on the 13th and 17th of this month in destination of
Boston	LOCATION	wherefrom the former will proceed to
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		There are at present 275 marines boarding transport ships at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	in destination of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The rest of the marines are embarking at
Plymouth	LOCATION	and all the infantry and cavalry will leave from
Cork	LOCATION	in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The information was received from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	that
Worcester	LOCATION	, a reserve ship of sixty-four guns , will sail with the transport ships , but it is only hearsay since this ship has not yet received orders to this effect .

		The transport ships gathered at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	at present number 27 .


Preston	PERSON	, with fifty guns and three hundred crew is being readied to sail for
Antigua	LOCATION	where she will relieve
Chatham	LOCATION	, also with fifty guns .

		-LSB- P.S. -RSB- Without wasting a single moment , I will add the various branches authorised by His Majesty -LSB- French -RSB- to the organisation of the
Secret Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		The branch at
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	has been active for some time .

		Those at
Chatham	LOCATION	and at the
Office of Ordnance	ORGANIZATION	will be established without much trouble .

		The only real difficulties will be encountered at the Admiralty , and I am determined to make every effort in order to surmount them .

		I will also take great care in keeping you exactly informed of all progress which we will be able to make in this matter .

		You may rely , My lord , upon my zeal and my great care in the spending of the King 's money .

		I wish to use it only when I am certain that the service of His Majesty will reap the greatest benefit from it .

		First , I must investigate the various responsibilities assigned to each clerk in order to find out which one will be most useful to us .

		Then , I must ascertain his fancies and personality traits , and determine his position in life so that I may attack him at his weakest spot .

		It may be that chance will serve us better than all these precautions ; at least , we had to be in a position to avail ourselves of every opportunity , and , My lord , this is what you have enabled me to do .

EDMUND BURKE	PERSON	'S SPEECH ON CONCILIATION WITH THE COLONIES 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB- March 22 , 1775 -RSB- Sir , permit me to observe that the use of force alone is but temporary .

		It may subdue for a moment , but it does not remove the necessity of subduing again ; and a nation is not governed which is perpetually to be conquered ... A further objection to force is , that you impair the object by your very endeavours to preserve it .

		The thing you fought for is not the thing which you -LSB- Extract -RSB- recover , but depreciated , sunk , wasted , and consumed in the contest .

		Nothingless will content me than whole
America	LOCATION	... .

		Let me add , that I do not choose wholly to break the American spirit , because it is the spirit that has made the country ... In this character of the Americans , a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole ; and as an ardent is always a jealous affection , your colonies become suspicious , restive , and untractable whenever they see the least attempt to wrest from them by force or shuffle from them by chicane what they think the only advantage worth living for ... Three thousand miles of ocean lie between you and them ... .

		You have , indeed , winged ministers of vengeance , who carry your bolts in their pounces to the remotest verge of the sea .

		But there a power steps in that limits the arrogance of raging passions and furious elements , and says , `` So far shalt thou go , and no further . ''

		... Then , Sir , from these six capital sources : of descent , of form of government , of religion in the northern provinces , of manners in the southern , of education , of the remoteness of situation from the first mover of government ー from all these causes a fierce spirit of liberty has grown up .

		It has grown with the growth of the people in your colonies , and increased with the increase of their wealth ; a spirit that unhappily meeting with an exercise of power in
England	LOCATION	which , however lawful , is not reconcilable to any ideas of liberty , much less with theirs , has kindled this flame that is ready to consume us ... 2 1 .

		The Proclamation publish 'd by the States General for restraining provisionally under certain Penalties , the Exportation of Arms and Ammunition for the space of Six Months , appeared this morning in Print , & will be distributed & fixed up in all the trading Towns of the Seven Provinces .

		I have the Honour to inclose one of the Copies of the Proclamation , with a Translation of it .

		2 It is the Opinion of Persons well conversant with Trade here , that these Orders of Their High Mightinesses will totally stop these clandestine Expeditions on Ships carrying the British Flag ; And that the Dutch Merchants who appear to have acted chiefly on Speculation , will in the present State of Affairs in
North America	LOCATION	, & from the Obstacles now thrown in their way at home , be deterred from speculating upon such Uncertainty , & with so many different Obstacles to surmount ; But of this ,

Cn Clark	PERSON	via
New York	LOCATION	enclosing Copy of the Resolutions moved for by Mr -LSB-
Edmund -RSB- Burke	PERSON	last Wensday but with the usual Success .

		The Ministry carrying it against him by a great Majority .

		How they could put a negative upon Resolutions which are in themselves incontestible , how they could say that the Colonies did not raise subsidies at the requesition of a Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	, and had not the thanks of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, when it appears on their Journals , is astonishing .

		These Resolutions are couched in the Spirit of the Constitution of this Country , & far superior to the conciliatory Bill of Lord
Chatham	LOCATION	, which abounds with numerous difficulties .

		When the Colonies refuse to raise Subsidies , at the requisition of a Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	, then & then only can they be complained of .

		I hope the next
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will determine with Wisdom , & make sure Errors they have perceived in their last determinations , will be rectified in this , but above all to conciliate the affections of the people at home I think essentially necessary for the good of the whole .

		I go on selling Wheat at 6/9 .

		I have sold more than half the Cargo , though have delivered but few .

M. GARNIER	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Versailles	LOCATION	, 26 March 1775 I have received , Sir , your letter No. 261 which you took the trouble to send me on the tenth of this month .

		The King saw with pleasure , Sir , the suppression of the clause concerning our fishing rights on the coast of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	which was inserted in the Bill restricting fishing for the inhabitants of
New England	LOCATION	.

		His Majesty approved the indirect means to which you resorted in order to obtain the said suppression all the more because this matter would not have justified a ministerial action on our part .

		The courtesy displayed by the British Ministers on this occasion is another proof of the sincerity of their conciliatory feelings and their desire to avoid any cause for the smallest argument between the two courts ; for this reason , we entertain no doubts whatsoever regarding them , and , for our part , we are certain that His British
Majesty	PERSON	is convinced that our intentions correspond perfectly with His ... It seems , Sir , that there is much concern with regard to the ships being commissioned in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		If the British ministers speak to you about this , you will assure them , as if you were speaking for yourself , that these ships now being commissioned are part of the design with regard to the King of
Morocco	LOCATION	.

		They will easily be convinced of it if they consider the small number of ships that one intends to put to sea .

London	LOCATION	, 28 March 1775 I have the honor to forward to you the request which the merchants of
London	LOCATION	interested in the trade with
Northern America	LOCATION	have presented to the King of
England	LOCATION	in order to beg His Majesty to refuse His consent with regard to the
Bill	PERSON	passed by both Houses .

		I join to this document the protest made by 16 Lords on the same subject ... We have not heard anything yet about the memorandum , petition and remonstrance expected from
New York	LOCATION	.

		It is only said with certainty that a ship which arrived there from
Glasgow	LOCATION	after the date set by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	when all importation must stop , was not able to unload her cargo neither whole nor in part , and that the situation is the same in the other Colonies .

		DEBATES IN THE BRITISH HOUSE OF LORDS 1 Thursday , March 30 , -LSB- 1775 -RSB- Mr.
John Luttrell	PERSON	said : Sir ; I am induced to offer a few observations upon the imperfections of the Bill before you , 2 that we may not too hastily adopt an opinion which has been frequently held forth by the friends of administration , that provided our trade from
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	should increase , though that , of
America	LOCATION	do suffer , you will have a greater number of seamen .

		Sir , it has been said , in support of the assertion I have alluded to , that very few American seamen return in English vessels from that coast .

		I think it a very fortunate circumstance that they do not , because we have no employment for them , and they therefore must become a burthen to this country .

		But I will appeal to my naval friends on the other side of the
House	ORGANIZATION	, whose knowledge of maritime concerns is very extensive , if American seamen are not always impressed in every part of the world to man the King 's ships whenever the service requires men ?

		... But , Sir , I have ever considered
America	LOCATION	to be a great nursery , where seamen are raised , trained , and maintained in times of peace to serve this country in times of war , and though I shall readily admit , from the distance of their shores , that you can not lay hands upon them the first half hour of an armament , yet am I persuaded that you may be possessed of some thousands within the time usually prescribed for the return of English seamen from foreign services .

		As I am up , Sir , I would wish to say a word or two upon that part of the Bill which principally relates to the commanders of his Majesty 's ships of war , employed for what the
Bill	PERSON	stiles the protection , but would be much more properly termed the destruction of the trade , and it may possibly not be found quite so easy in practice as to some people it appears in theory , either to seize these vessels , or to discover false clearances or certificates ... .

		I have no doubt but the Americans , by being put into the calamitous situation they are , and feeling the tyranny of the mother country , will endeavour to carry on a trade at the risk of the fine imposed under this Act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	; ... Sir , on the score of seizure I shall revert to my former arguments , that the King 's ships can not keep the seas in safety , in the northern parts of the coasts of
America	LOCATION	, for more than half the year .

		Whenever they can cruize , the Americans will have the advantages , that a perfect knowledge of the shoals , soundings , rocks , creeks , and places of shelter can afford them ; by which means they must frequently escape your most vigilant researches : besides it is not a very pleasant service for an officer to risk the King 's ships upon a lee-shore , with which he is totally unacquainted , not in pursuit of an enemy , but to destroy a friend .

		Upon the whole , Sir , I consider this
Bill	PERSON	to be somewhat less cruel than that which is meant to demolish the
New England	LOCATION	provinces by famine ; in every other respect I hold it to be equally mischievous .

		It is with real concern I see humanity and sound policy giving way to that hated revenge which involves indescriminately the innocent with the guilty .

		By this oppressive Act you will certainly extend the unhappy differences which already but too generally prevail in
America	LOCATION	, to every province ; nay , I fear I may say , to almost every individual upon that vast continent : therefore , I protest against the measure .

London	LOCATION	, 31 March 1775 The frigate Coventry has sailed from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	on the 28th of this month in destination of the
East Indies	LOCATION	from where the corvette
Hawke	PERSON	just arrived .

		The frigate
Levant	PERSON	arrived in this port on the 29th .

		She comes from

		The letters of the same date from

America	LOCATION	.

		The marines who had boarded ship at
Plymouth	LOCATION	were still there on the 26th of this month , detained by unfavorable winds .

		I have often heard , My lord , that our sea officers were excellent in theory and superior to the British in that matter , and that they lacked only the practice acquired at sea ; to tell the truth , the latter is considered as more essential than the former .

		Since the scarcity of our commissions does not allow them to acquire this practice as much as they would like , would it not be possible to use the youngest ones as volunteers in the fleet now being commissioned in the Spanish ports .

		It seems to me , My lord , that there would result among other advantages an opportunity to bind by a mutual esteem the officers of the two nations who will eventually be called upon to defend the respective possessions of their Sovereigns .

		I beg your pardon , My lord , if I take it upon myself to make such a suggestion ; and I beg to impute the liberty that I take on this occasion only to my most sincere zeal .

VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 7 April 1775 I shall continue to direct the strictest attention to the various matters interesting the Service of the King and especially these matters that you particularly recommended to me , My lord .


Myd Rochford	PERSON	spoke to me yesterday about the ships now being commissioned in
Spain	LOCATION	advancing only that the Opposition observes that large vessels could not be intended for the coast of
Africa	LOCATION	since the waters are not deep enough to allow these ships to get close to it .

		I answered , My lord , in the manner that you dictated , and
Myd Rochford	PERSON	assured me that he was equally convinced that these ships were intended for no other purpose than the war against the King of
Morocco	LOCATION	... The troops in destination of
America	LOCATION	are about to depart from
Corke	PERSON	in
Ireland	LOCATION	, and the Generals will leave any time in order to embark at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	.

		There is much talk about two ships from
Virginia	LOCATION	that are said to have sailed directly to
Dunkerque	ORGANIZATION	in order to unload their cargo of tobacco without calling at any British port .

		If this fact is true and is repeated , the merchants of
London	LOCATION	and
Glasgow	LOCATION	who have raised so high the price of their tobacco will be disappointed in their waiting .

		This is a clear infraction of the Navigation Act ; but it is up to the British and not to us to carry out the inforcement of their trade laws .

		The Corporation of the City of
London	LOCATION	has presented a remonstrance to the King .

		You will find it in substance in the Bulletin .

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 11 April 1775 As the legal
Assembly of New York	ORGANIZATION	discussed whether it would conform itself to the resolution of non-importation as recommended by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, this question has been determined in the negative by a majority of 4 voices .

		Next it entertained the motion that a ship recently arrived from
London	LOCATION	should be allowed to unload her goods and the motion was passed with a majority of 5 voices .

		But the
Committee of Inspection	ORGANIZATION	appointed by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	came up with the opposite decision and since it was backed by a large majority of the people , the ship was forced to leave immediately without unloading anything .

		She was allowed with great condescension to take water and food supplies for her trip back .

		The Generals are to leave next Saturday ... Since the terms of the proclamation by His British Majesty forbidding the exportation of weapons and other war ammunitions were to expire on the 19th of this month , the Government has extended the said terms for a period of six months .

		Since the terms of this proclamation are intended only for the Colonies in
Northern America	LOCATION	, exception can easily be made for ammunition destined for other places .

		After receiving the information that a small ship is presently being loaded in
London	LOCATION	for
Gibraltar	LOCATION	with 250 barrels of powder , cannon balls , etc. we discovered that she was destined for
Tangier	LOCATION	... The corvette Raven arrived from the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	in
Portsmouth	LOCATION	where she will be laid up .

		The frigate Argo sailed for
Antigua	LOCATION	from
Plymouth	LOCATION	on the 5th of this month ; the ship
Portland	LOCATION	and the corvette
Pomona	LOCATION	, presently at

		The corvette

Capt Smith	PERSON	comes out a Passenger , but is to Act as a riding Captain in the Country , as you will see more particularly by the
Charter Party	ORGANIZATION	, a Copy of which he has with him ー This Vessell , as well as the rest , I hope you will contrive to get Loaded some how , it is the last I shall send out this year , and altogether they will not carry 1500 hhds , a less quantity than we have had home any one year , for sometime past and the Accots .

		Sales I am sure have never been better , nor so good , for which reasons , I say , I hope these Ships will all get Loaded , and to your best care , I recommend them , wishing them every one safe to youー I am very Anxious to hear from you and wonder much I dont get a Letter by some Conveyance or other , surely it can not be much longer before I do Mr
Russell	PERSON	has inform 'd me he shall close the Commission on the Negroe Affair next week , having already kept it open a long time .

		I have prevailed upon him to promise to stay untill I can hear from you once more before he does , and that is allー Manduit is exceedingly Angry that you did not send him any thing by the last Packet as I expected he would ー And I am exceedingly distressed on Account of not having sold any Tobo so long ー and some of our Tradesmen are very Ill temper 'd Just now so that I have nothing very pleasant to write you by this Opportunity You shall hear from me by every Conveyance and for the present I remain ー Dear Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-

Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	15th April 1775 So much depends upon the inclosed Act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	for restraining the
Commerce & Fisheries	ORGANIZATION	of the
New England	LOCATION	Governments , that I can not too earnestly recommend it to your Attention , at the same time it is hoped that the good effects of it will be found , not in the Restrictions it contains , but in that return of Duty and Obedience on the part of the People which will render the Execution of those Restrictions unnecessary .

		With regard to the other Act for restraining the Commerce of the more
Southern Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, the Execution of it depends principally upon the Care and Vigilance of the Governors of those Colonies , but I am nevertheless commanded by the King to transmit it to you for your Information .

		RICHARD CHAMPION TO WILLING ,

Gentlemen Bristol	ORGANIZATION	15 April 1775 My Last was 26 Ultimo since I have your favour 22 feby Your Opinion about the
Quantities of Wheat and Flour	ORGANIZATION	sent here is just , & the price has been supported tolerably , though it might have been kept up at 7 / .

		however considering the variety of hands it was in , it was better than expected , especially as many were eager to sell , & some was actually sold at 6/7 1/2 ; however the steadiness of the other Holders supported the price .

		You may judge how great our Wants were when we have already imported 181,852 Bushels Wheat & 18,711 Barrels flour & yet the price keeps up .

		You are right in one respect about the Friendship 's Cargo being of good Quality .

		It was a clean good grain , but white , consequently light , & not so much admired here as the heavier grain which though not so white is preferred greatly & will produce a much larger quantity of Flour .

		This made it a difficulty with me to support the price at 6/9 when there were so many Cargoes of heavy wheat at market a preferable grain however as nothing could enduce me to lower the price I only lost a quicke Sale as I have now nearly sold the whole , though I have not delivered a great deal the purchasers being very slow in taking it away .

		The Weather has been favourable of late , but it is not too late to give up all fears of bad before the Summer comes on .

		I shall keep you constantly advised , but let it be a good Harvest Wheat will not be under 6/9 till November .

		No News in politicks .

		The restraining Bills having both passed you will easily discover the mood of Government which prevails here .

		We shall be anxiously expecting to hear from

ANDREW FRAZER	PERSON	TO
JOHN HOWARD	PERSON	, LORD SUFFOLK 1 -LRB- Copy . -RRB-


Dunkirk	PERSON	18th April 1775 Sr As soon -LSB- as -RSB- I was honored with your Letter of the 14th Instant desiring to be informed if an English Ship from
Virginia	LOCATION	loaded with Tobacco had lately put into this Port , I made the strictest enquiries to discover the truth of this Intelligence , and accordingly find that an English Ship about 200 Tons burthen whose name is the Catherine Captain
Paton Master	PERSON	put into this Port directly from
Virginia	LOCATION	the 23d of last Month , and landed his Cargo here of about 16000 Staves , and about 60 or 70
Hogsheads of Tobacco	ORGANIZATION	as far as I have been able to learn .

		The number of Staves is easily ascertained as they were put up to sale a few days ago but the real quantity of Tobacco is perhaps only known to the Owner & the Merchants to whom the Cargo was consigned whose Name is
Murdock	PERSON	An Irish merchant settled here about 5 years ago .

		These persons having an Interest to keep the Transactions as secret as possible , it is difficult to come at the knowledge of the exact quantity , and the freedom of the Port spares the necessity of a fair Declaration ー However it is now known that Tobacco was brought hither in that Ship , though that part of the Cargo was got on shore in as private a Manner as the nature of the thing could admit of .

		This Vessel is still in the
Harbour	LOCATION	, and is now repairing , nor have any preparations yet been made which indicate a design of sailing from hence soon .

		Previous to his arrival here , I have been told that Captain
Paton	PERSON	put into
Portsmouth Harbour	LOCATION	for Two or three days , but I know not upon what account .

		These Sir are the principal Pieces of Intelligence I have been able to collect relative to this Ship But upon a further examination into this subject and upon conversing with different people in the
Tobacco Trade	ORGANIZATION	, I find that this is by no means the first
Instance of Tobacco	ORGANIZATION	's being brought hither directly from america .

		It has been a practice I understand within the four or five years to clear out Vessels from
Virginia	LOCATION	&
Maryland	LOCATION	for
St Eustatia	ORGANIZATION	with Staves , under which there is concealed a quantity of Tobacco , to which place they seldom go , but proceed directly to some part of the Continent of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		I have heard in particular of a Capt.
Campbell Master	ORGANIZATION	of a Schooner of about 100 Tons Called the
Isabella	PERSON	who was here twice with a
Cargo of Tobacco & Staves	ORGANIZATION	during the Course of last year He was equally consigned to Mr
Murdock	PERSON	, & by him supplied with
Silks	PERSON	and Teas , with which he loaded on his return to
America	LOCATION	, taking a Clearance from hence for the Island of St Eustatia Both of these Vessels , the Isabella &
Catherine	PERSON	belong I am told to a

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 28 April 1775 Three corvettes are being commissioned for a foreign destination .

		I suppose that two of them will be used along the coast of
Africa	LOCATION	according to what Myd .


Rochford	PERSON	told me .

		Order has just been given recently at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	to place the crew of a frigate being laid up on board a guard ship in order to help fit out the ship Romney destined for
Newfoundland	LOCATION	and according to the rumor there , the crews on the ships expected anyday from the
Cape	LOCATION	and that will be laid up upon their return will not be paid off .

		These events seem to indicate that they intend to bring out this year as last year a fleet of observation .

		I believe also , My lord , that the encouragements offered to hasten the return of the vessels now fishing in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	could have the object , among others , to secure a number of sailors in case it would be deemed necessary for the service of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		These measures seem to indicate the suspicion on the part of the Ministry that they may have to prepare for war towards the middle of the summer .

		It has already been affirmed to me that Myd .

		Sandwich , as he rendered account of the Spanish ship commissions , was of the opinion that
England	LOCATION	too , should prepare for war .

		Although this advice , which will always be held by
Myd Sandwich	PERSON	, has not yet been adopted , I shall take the greatest care to watch more and more the movements of this country .

		As it evidently be for your own advantage I shall expect a large consignt this season from you & if my friends do not exert themselves , I shall be badly off , having sent out 2 large ships .

		ー The Public Newspapers give you enough of Politics & the Ministers by Acts of
Parliat	LOCATION	, Addresses & the Armament sent to
America	LOCATION	, speak too plainly that nothing but the Sword shall decide the contest with you .

		You have been declared Rebels , by the

		Unanimity among the Colonies will absolutely insure success .

		WILLIAM LEE TO JOHN AUGUSTINE

London	LOCATION	15 May 75 According to my promise by
Capt Brown	PERSON	I now transmit you sales for 4 hhds Tobo recd P the Friendship Roman Nt procds # 35.14.1 to yr credt which must prove satisfactory , as I have no doubt of their being much better than what you have recd for
Tobo	PERSON	last year .

		As I apprehended , the price here has risen considerably so that what you send home this year will come to a fine market , therefore shall be happy to have it in my power to please my friends by returning them agreeable sales , and I hope to share considerably in your favr either by Capt Brown or
Norwood	LOCATION	.

		You have the Principio Compys quarterly acct to Xmas last , by which there is a small balce of # 5.18 .

		10 3/4 due to yr late Brs Estate , but then it appears that the Compy owe # 300 by Note to
Smith , Bevan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	ー Mr
Russel	PERSON	sent very little Iron home last year , nor do I find enough is expected this season to give any prospect of a dividend for 12 Mos to come .

		As to Politics , little can be said on that head , since the Ministers have determined that the sword shall decide the contest .

		I have no doubt of your success if you are united & determined to stand or fall together , which I take for granted will be the case .

		You are contending for every thing that is dear in this World , Liberty , Property & Life , therefore I expect you will act as worthy descendants of Englishmen .

		My best respects attend

		I do not fear these sales giving full satisfaction when compared with those from other houses .

		With confidence I say your own are good ー the
Esta Tobo	ORGANIZATION	was uncommonly light & of very indiffert quality .

		Having sent out 2 large Ships this year I shall suffer much unless my friends exert themselves a good deal , but from yr .

		steady kindness I have good reason to expect every assistance , which will always be gratefully acknowledged .

		Within this month past
Tobo	PERSON	has risen considerably here , so that the Shiprs will send their
Tobo	LOCATION	to a good markt & that which comes home latest will probably sell best .

		You must know by this time that our wicked ministers are gone quite mad .

		Is it possible that the Americans can bear with patience such repeated & wanton insults & oppressions ?

		The K -LSB- ing -RSB- & his Ministers have publicly proclaimed you Rebels ー Every body knows what Rebels have alone to trust to .

		ー The Ld Mayor very justly observed that a successful Rebellion was always called a Revolution & from his confidence in the Virtue & Fortitude of the Americans , he was not at a loss to determine what that wou 'd be hereafter called , which the Ministers were now pleased to term Rebellion .

		I can not suppose that any dangers will deter you from persevering to the last extremity in defence of yr Liberty & with unanimity you must succeed .

		The Ministers have sent such violent orders to Genl -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	that we every day expect advice of a genl engagement in
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	.

		The Scotch Gentn have got advice of the proceedings of yr last
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Richmond	LOCATION	; one of your flattering resolutions to his Excellency , is very different from what we have been taught to expect , as the Ministerial runners in the City had abt 10 daies ago reported that
Governmt	PERSON	had recd advice of a plan deliberately settled in
Virga	PERSON	to seize the Governors person & all the K -LSB- ing -RSB- s officers , & keep them as hostages for the safety of such Americans as Genl
Gage	PERSON	has certainly recd orders to take up & send over for tryal .

		The Eyes of all
Europe	LOCATION	are upon
America	LOCATION	& the Ministers attend much to the motions in
Virga	PERSON	for they seem to think you will fight ; wch they have been taught to believe the N.E. people will not do .

		Indeed the conduct of
Virga	PERSON	& New Engld will decide this business , but success will be more easy & certain if all the Colonies are united .

		Wonderful preparations are makg in
France	LOCATION	&
Spain	LOCATION	; with the latter we shall certainly come to an open Rupture , very soon after a blow is struck in
America	LOCATION	.

		In the mean time I pray you to assist my ships in their loadg as much as you possibly can .

		Best respects attend Mrs Kenner & am & ー 1 .

London	LOCATION	15 May 1775 Yr favr of Feby I recd P

		You have now yr Acct Sales for 8 hhds Tobo recd P Roman Nt Proceeds # 59.17.11 to yr credt which I dare say will give you full satisfaction & shall hope will induce you to enlarge your consignmts this year considerably , expecially as the price of
Tobo	PERSON	here -LSB- h -RSB- as risen much .

		Whenever the American dispute is settled & the trade restored to a regular course there will not be much difficulty in settlg the Ball : due
Messrs Russell & Molleson	ORGANIZATION	.

		'T is unlucky yr orders for sending yr son to the Jerseys , did not come to hand 'till long after Capt Brown sail 'd ; however as I understand he has arrived safe & well you can easily send him there from
Virga	PERSON	, & I hope the example of the school together with his growing older , will reform his wildness .

		Be pleased to remember us to him .

		ー Having sent out two large ships this year I shall get into a disagreeable situation unless my friends exert themselves , which I hope they will do & particularly yourself , for which I shall ever hold myself much obliged .


Mrs Lee	PERSON	& her son

HANNAH CORBIN	PERSON	1 My dear Sister !


London	LOCATION	15 May 1775 I now send yr Acct Sales for the 9 hhds of Tobo you kindly consigned to my care by the Friendship Roman Nt .

		Procds # 46.6.9 to yr credt wch considering the times are good sales , but still for your sake I wish it had been in my power to have got you twice as much .

		While yr non importation continues it will be impossible for me to send yr goods , but if that shd ever end , they shall be sent P the first oppty & in the mean time , you shd : endeavour to make the necessary cloathing for yr self & Family at home .

		God only knows when the unhappy differences between G : B : &
America	LOCATION	will end , but in so laudale a contest it is surely the part of a virtuous mind to submit with patience & fortitude to every inconvenience that may arise from it , for surely none can be so great as the loss of Liberty .

		With common industry you can not want Meat &
Rayment	PERSON	, tho ' it may be coarse , but what am I to do here , where neither can be obtained without hard money ?

		however I shall be content if
America	LOCATION	is but Free .


Mrs Lee	PERSON	& her little patriot W. ー L ー are very well & with me waft our best love & good wishes for you & the dear children .

London	LOCATION	15 May 1775 I have recd your favor of Aprl 6th covering A Blairs secd dft : for # 150 on
Spiers & Co	ORGANIZATION	which I have sent to
Glasgow	LOCATION	for acceptce & if paid shall be to the credt of
Triplett & Thornton	ORGANIZATION	.

		The former dft you mention of # 300 is paid & to the crdt of T. & T. indeed yr remittans have not been so full as coud have been wished & I fear you have lost the oppty of remitg : amply to a very considerable advantage .

		Had you bot 1000 hhds at 2P / 6
Curry	PERSON	as I advised by the
Caroline Capt Blackwell	PERSON	in Decr last , you woud have made a small Fortune at one stroke , for the price of
Tobo	LOCATION	has risen very considerably here within these 6 wks : & in my opinion it will rise still higher .

		As to shippg goods , that business is at prest totally at a stop , but shd the trade ever revive , I shall have no kind of objection to continue our correspondence within the reasonable limits you mention , but according to my settled plan , security will be expected for what is advanced which I suppose will be easy for you to give as you propose to confine yr self within reasonable & prudent bounds .

		I shall be greatly disapointed & perhaps be put to exceeding inconvenience if you do not ship largely this year , because I have sent out two large ships , relying on yr assistance & that of my other mercantile correspondents , & knowing you wd have recd very considerable advantages by purchasg largely in proper time .

		I still have confidence in yr generosity not to let me suffer , I am & ー 1 .

London	LOCATION	15 May 1775 Be pleased to receive yr sales for 8 hhds of Tobo recd P the Friendship Roman nt proceeds # 50.14.10 to yr credt which I hope will please as you may be assured of my utmost endeavors to get the best possible price for you & dare say these sales will at least , equal what you get from other houses .


Tobo	PERSON	has risen here very much lately & I do expect the price will be higher still , but as this advance arises chiefly from yr agreemt : to stop the exportn ; it ought not to operate in
Virga	PERSON	to break that engagemt ; & the surest way to prevent any murmurings on that head , is to cease the cultivation for one year at least , which will be attended with this good consequence that every person will have more time & leisure to cultivate & manufacture materials for necessary cloathing , without which , it will be difficult to persevere in the noble contest you are engaged in for the preservation of yr Liberties .

		You have a Magazine & c inclosed that will shew you ,
America	LOCATION	has some warm friends here , but still your chief dependance shd be on yourselves ー I hope my ships will this year will meet with your warmest assistance for which you will always receive my grateful acknowledgemts & shall ever remain & ー 1 .

Tobo	LOCATION	in Brown at ys -LSB- this -RSB- time or wait 'till the event is enevitable & then give twice or perhaps four times as much Prems I will act for you as I do for myself & with this you must surely be content .

		You have inclosed Acct Sales for yr 32 hhds Tobo recd P the Friendship , Roman nt procds ー # 224.3.11 to yr credt .

		These sales can not displease you as on the whole they must be much better than what you will receive from any other quarter .

		ー You know my earnest willingness to serve you on all occasions & tho ' I conceive these are dangerous times to make purchases , yet if my 2 Ships the Adventure & Prospect get loaded , I can so far assist you as # 400 or # 500 will go , provided you do not draw till the Octr Court , at 60 or 90 daies sight & use yr utmost endeavors to keep others from drawg .

		Mr

		It was understood here that the Tea was destroyed with W :
H. Nortons	PERSON	consent in order to appease the indignation that possessed the Gentlemen on Acct of the Tea being sent ; But the Capts protest says it was done by the force & violence of a lawless & ungovernable people or words to the same effect .

		I call it reporting because you must be very sensible of the inability of our profligate & abandond ministers to carry their schemes into execution of enslavg

		This post is for Life , Honorable , & attended wth very little expence .

		The Scotch we understand are buying up all the

		Let Mr

		Do you know one
John Hipkins	PERSON	?

		I fancy he must be a notorious Sharper ー he is getting all the Planters in
Essex	LOCATION	to draw bills on me at sight .

		This Puppies plan is no doubt to injure me if he can , therefore it wd be proper to stop him in his Carreer .

		A Bill this day appeared on me at Sight pble to himself supposed to be drawn by
James Bray	PERSON	.

		It is protested for want of advice & because I do not believe the Signature to be the hand writg of

LONDON	LOCATION	CHRONICLE , SATURDAY , MAY 27 , TO TUESDAY , MAY 30 , 1775
London	LOCATION	.

		-LSB- May 30 . -RSB-

		Yesterday morning some dispatches arrived at Lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	's office from General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	at
Boston	LOCATION	, brought by a ship arrived at
Bristol	LOCATION	from that province .

		1 They were forwarded by a messenger to his Majesty at
Kew	LOCATION	.

		From the
Essex Gazette	ORGANIZATION	, printed at
Salem	LOCATION	, in
New England	LOCATION	.

		-LSB- Here is inserted the account given by the
Essex Gazette	ORGANIZATION	of Tuesday , April 25 , of the engagment at
Lexington	LOCATION	and
Concord	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- Yesterday stock fell one and a half per cent .

		on account of the above news .

		1 .

		The dispatches were probably duplicates of those of March 28 , 1775 , which had been received in
England	LOCATION	on May 2 , 1775 .

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM
PORTSMOUTH	LOCATION	, MAY 30 -LSB- 1775 -RSB- '' 1 This afternoon a vessel from the Isle of
Wight	PERSON	arrived here , the Captain says that a vessel lay at the back of the above island , which came with dispatches from General -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	, 2 which they had put on shore that morning ; and that she would lie there two or three days before she came up to
Spithead	LOCATION	; for which reason was not mentioned , nor was anything to be got from the people relating to the affairs at
Boston	LOCATION	.

		1 .


London Chronicle	ORGANIZATION	, May 30 to June 1 , 1775 .

		2 .

		The dispatches were not from General
Gage	PERSON	, but for the American agents in
London	LOCATION	, and the vessel was the Quero , Captain
John Derby	PERSON	, from
Salem	LOCATION	.

		LORD
GEORGE GERMAIN	PERSON	TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL
JOHN IRWIN	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Pall Mall May 30th 1775 The news from
America	LOCATION	occasioned a great Stir among us yesterday , by the first report I was afraid the Troops had misbehaved , but upon reading the account from
Salem	LOCATION	I was Satisfy 'd that the
Party	ORGANIZATION	after having done what they were order 'd at
Concord	ORGANIZATION	, marchd back towards
Boston	LOCATION	, and possibly may have lost some few men .

		however the Bostonians are in the right to make the Kings Troops the aggressors and to Claim a victory .


Gage	PERSON	's account is not yet arrived , he sent his Letters by a merchant Ship laden with goods , the Bostonians sent their Story by a Ship in Ballast , the Master of which brought no Letters whatever , but appeard in
London	LOCATION	yesterday morning with the account you will see printed , and a
London	LOCATION	Evening Post Extraordinary was published last night to spread the Alarm .

		it is Strange to see the many joyfull faces upon this Event , thinking , I conclude , that Rebellion will be the means of Changing the Ministry , in my poor opinion this Blow , if follow 'd up , will soon bring that province into order , as I must suppose the Officer who Commanded the
Party	ORGANIZATION	did not without necessity attack those armed men who presented themselves to him ; It is said that a Pistol accidentally fired occasioned all the mischief ; I am impatient for the true and the full account .

		Lord
Percy	PERSON	encamped that night some little way from
Boston	LOCATION	, so that he was not afraid of his pursuers , as they term themselves I have seen no Ministers , but I have seen Governour -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Hutchinson	PERSON	, and he agrees with me in opinion , and says the hurry they were in of sending a ship express from
Salem	LOCATION	convinces him that the story is misrepresented for purposes of the faction there .

Massachusets Bay	LOCATION	and a Detachment of his Majesty 's Troops ; it is proper to inform the Publick , that no Advices have as yet been received in the American Department of any such Event .

		There is reason to believe that there are Dispatches from General -LSB-

ARTHUR LEE	PERSON	TO THE EDITOR OF
LONDON	LOCATION	CHRONICLE 1 Tuesday , May the 30th , 1775 As a doubt of the authenticity of the account from
Salem	LOCATION	, touching an engagement between the King 's Troops and the Provincials in the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	, may arise from a paragraph in the -LSB-
London	LOCATION	-RSB- Gazette of this evening , I desire to inform all those who wish to see the original affidavits which confirm that account , that they are deposited at the
Mansion House	LOCATION	with the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor for their inspection .

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 30 May 1775 The British
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	is completely at rest as far as we are concerned ; because they are sure of our peaceful intentions , they do not worry about the movements of the Spanish
Navy	ORGANIZATION	and troops ; I attempted to find out what their opinion on this matter really is .

		They are convinced that the planned expedition does not have any other purpose , for the moment , than an attack against
Africa	LOCATION	.

		But they fear that upon receiving the news of the hostilities recently declared in
Brazil	LOCATION	, and especially the advantage taken by the Portuguese over the Spaniards in that part of the world , His Catholic Majesty may fall immediately upon
Lisbon	LOCATION	with his forces already gathered and ready to move .

		They think that the superiority of the Portuguese forces in
Brazil	LOCATION	may have lead
M. de Pombal	PERSON	2 to give them a free hand against the Spaniards and that the King of
Spain	LOCATION	, faced with the difficulty of regaining the advantage in that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, may deem more to his convenience to take an immediate revenge in
Europe	LOCATION	, where
Portugal	LOCATION	may easily be conquered before
England	LOCATION	could provide her with effective help .

		Such is the train of thought of the Ministry at present ; as tiresome as they may find this uncertainty , they dare not do anything to guard against all possible events for fear of spreading alarms that might prove fatal for the present state of affairs in
America	LOCATION	as well as the peace in
Europe	LOCATION	; they flatter themselves in thinking that
France	LOCATION	would restrain
Spain	LOCATION	in the foresight that an attack against
Portugal	LOCATION	would unavoidably cause war ... The frigates La Surprise and Aldborough which are attached to the
Newfoundland	LOCATION	squadron have just sailed from
Plymouth	LOCATION	for their destination ;
Romney	PERSON	with 50 guns is ready to sail from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	under the command of the Superintendent of Fishing .

Salem	LOCATION	of the defeat of Col -LSB-
Francis -RSB- Smith	PERSON	, and the precipitate Retreat of Lord -LSB-
Hugh -RSB- Percy	PERSON	by the animated resistance of the brave Bostonians .

		3 This intelligence , so contrary to the expectations of Government , who have daily anounced the Americans Cowards , has pannick struck Administration , and their tory Dependants , and has exihilirated the Spirits of the
Sons of America	ORGANIZATION	in this Metropolis , and the Friends to Freedom , in the most exhalted manner .

		It is impossible to describe the Shame & Vexation , which are visibly depicted in the Countenances of
North	LOCATION	, and his tyrannical Abettors .

		They are constrained to acknowledge , that the Regulars began the Attack , and equally forced to admit the intrepidity of our Countrey men .

VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 31 May 1775 Our correspondent in
Portsmouth	LOCATION	informed us on the 28th that five dispatches had arrived the day before , carrying various orders .

		He did not know their contents except for one which brought the order for the ship Meredith to sail immediately for
Gibraltar	LOCATION	and the frigate Levant for
Jamaica	LOCATION	; the workmen labored on their sails until eleven o'clock in the evening that same day .

		On Sunday , the 28th , they were still at it and supplies were brought on board hurriedly .

		The order was given in the same port to fit out the frigates Thetis and
Fox	PERSON	, but we do not know their destination .

		The
Brigantine Lyon	LOCATION	had sailed the day before for
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		We assume that one of the above mentioned orders concern the fitting out of the ships destined to cruise during the Summer in accordance with the information which I had the honor to send you recently and which has not come back to us yet from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	or
Plymouth	LOCATION	.

		They are sending a small ship to the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The same letter tells us that all the sailors from the merchant-men then in
Portsmouth	LOCATION	have taken flight fearing an impressment .

		We have every reason to believe that their fear is unfounded , but it seems that the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	is again alarmed by the Spanish armaments and that these avisos are sent in any event to advise their far-away garrisons and squadron to keep more strictly on the look-out .

		POSTSCRIPT OF
LONDON	LOCATION	CHRONICLE , TUESDAY , MAY 30 TO THURSDAY , JUNE 1 , 1775
London	LOCATION	-LSB- June 1 -RSB- .

		A letter from an Officer on board the
Somerset	LOCATION	man of war at
Salem	LOCATION	, says , `` You will no doubt receive by the same vessel which brings this , an account of the late most lamentable disturbance at
Lexington	LOCATION	... Our ship , as well as the Lively and two sloops are at present stationed to prevent a conjunction of the troops from any of the detachments which are assembled at
Bellingham	LOCATION	-LSB- sic . -RSB-

		and
Tash	PERSON	river , as they must march along the road which is commanded by our cannon ... Neither our seamen or soldiers enter heartily on the service .

		Our marines are almost in arms , and of the whole which I left the ship on the above service , eighteen have deserted . ''

		1 A Correspondent says , `` Many persons very absurdly blame Administration , because the ship
Sukey	PERSON	, Capt.
Brown	PERSON	, with the dispatches from Gen.
-LSB- Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, did not arrive before or as soon as the ship with the printed account of the skirmish ; but they should consider that though the
Sukey	PERSON	sailed four days before the other , that she might probably meet with bad weather during those four days , which may have obliged her to put into some port to repair her damages , and by that means the ship which sailed last from
America	LOCATION	arrived first .

		And it is no uncommon thing for a private merchant ship to bring intelligence from different places before the government packet , for the above reason . ''

		1 .

		This letter appears to have been concocted in
London	LOCATION	, rather than writtten from the
Somerset	LOCATION	.

		LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	TO GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	1 -LRB- No 20 -RRB-
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	1st June 1775 Sir , Since my letter to you of 27th ulto an account has been printed here , accompanied with Depositions to verify it , of Skirmishes between a Detachment of the Troops under your Command , and different Bodies of the provincial Militia .

		It appears , upon the fullest Inquiry , that this Account , which is chiefly taken from a
Salem Newspaper	ORGANIZATION	, has been published by a Captain
Darby	PERSON	-LSB-
John Derby	PERSON	-RSB- , who arrived on Friday or Saturday -LSB- May 26 or 27 -RSB- at
Southampton	LOCATION	, in a small Vessel in Ballast , directly from
Salem	LOCATION	; and from every Circumstance relating to this Person & the Vessel , it is evident he was employed by the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	to bring this account , which is plainly made up for the purpose of conveying every possible Prejudice and misrepresentation of the Truth .

		From the Answers he has given to such questions as have been asked , there is the greatest Probability that the whole amounts to no more than that a Detachment sent by you to destroy
Cannon and Stores	ORGANIZATION	, collected at
Concord	LOCATION	for the purpose of aiding Rebellion were fired upon at different times by the
People of the Country	ORGANIZATION	in small Bodies from behind Trees and Houses , but that the
Party	ORGANIZATION	effected the Service they went upon , & returned to
Boston	LOCATION	, and I have the Satisfaction to tell you that the Affair being considered in that light by all discerning Men , it has had no other effect here than to raise that just Indignation which every honest Man must feel at the rebellious Conduct of the
New England Colonies	LOCATION	.

		At the same time it is very much to be lamented that We have not some Account from you of this Transaction , which I do not mention from any Supposition that you did not send the earliest Intelligence of it , for we know from
Darby	PERSON	that a Vessel with Dispatches from you sailed four days before him .

		We expect the Arrival of that Vessel with great Impatience , but till she arrives I can form no decisive Judgment of what has happened , and therefore can have nothing more to add but that I am & ca

		-LSB- June 5 . -RSB-

		A ship arrived at
Bristol	LOCATION	on Monday last -LSB- May 29 -RSB- in 30 days from
Hampton	LOCATION	, in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		She brings advice that the people of
Virginia	LOCATION	had heard of the whole affair at
Boston	LOCATION	; that 24,000 provincial troops lay before it ; that General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	had been requested to let those come out who were inclined , which he had refused ; that it was thought the provincial troops would speedily begin to cannonade the town ; and that upon receiving these advices in
Virginia	LOCATION	, Gen.
Washington	LOCATION	immediately set out to join the army at
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Another ship is arrived at
Bristol	LOCATION	from New-York .

		She , it is said , brings advices , that when the people of New-York were informed of the skirmish at
Concord	ORGANIZATION	, they rose in a body , went to the town-house , where the arms of the troops were deposited , and directly seized them .

		In the harbour there were two ships laden with stores for General
Gage	PERSON	, which they seized and unloaded .

		The provincial troops of New-York immediately began their march for
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The
Boston Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	of Monday , April 24 , has the following paragraph : `` The Printers of the
Boston Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	hereby inform the town , that they shall desist publishing their paper after this day , till matters are in a more settled state . ''

		RICHARD CHAMPION TO WILLING ,
MORRIS & CO	ORGANIZATION	1
Gentlemen Bristol	ORGANIZATION	7 June 1775 My Last was 15 April Since I have your favors 30 March & 11 April .

		I was in hopes to have been able to have rendered your Sales & Acct Current of the Wheat , but the quantities on hand have prevented the people taking away , so that the Warehouses are not yet cleared , which is the occassion of my not being able to settle the Account ー They promise me it will be cleared away soon .

		Wheat , owing to the Quantity imported , the very dry weather which has stopped most of the
Mills	PERSON	, and the very promising appearance of the new wheat , has declined to 6/6 .

		The Importations into the
Kingdom	LOCATION	have been immense , & without them Wheat would have been very high .

		How to advise you in future I know not .

		If the Weather continues favorable Wheat will not be dearer , & I fear will fall , but if there should be wet sufficient to endanger the Harvest , it must keep up & rise ; at present the quantities are large in the
Kingdom	LOCATION	for sale , but then they must go off gradually , as there is very little English Com .

		Super fine flour 17/6 common 15/6 & 16 / Indien Corn 3/3 .

		The latter Article will I think encrease in demand , but the Summer not so much so ; The Duty being taken off is greatly in its favour .

		Mr -LSB-
Edmund -RSB- Burke	PERSON	our Representative daily rises in the Esteem of the true friends to his Country .

		His last Speech , which I do not send you , as it is gone out from
London	LOCATION	, as soon as published , & I was from home when it came out , shews him to be a true friend to the Constitution of the whole Empire , & a perfect Master of its Interests .

		I have heard nothing about the Champion , & therefore am uncertain whether she will come to you , if she does you will in course follow my orders , but in the present State of the market , I should not think it prudent to make any Concern now , as the Harvest is So very promising , nor can I recommend any to be sent here after the receipt of this Letter , You shall however be further advised .

		The late Disturbances at
Boston	LOCATION	have various Effects here some believe , others disbelieve the Story , I think it for my part too clear an Account to admit of the least doubt .

		What the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	will now do it is impossible to say .

		give way at last they must .

		WILLIAM LEE TO
SAMUEL GRIFFIN	PERSON	1 Dear Sir !


London	LOCATION	8 June 1775 I wrote you the 25 of Aprl wch is my 3rd Letter in the course of this year , to all wch be pleased to refer .

		The other day I recd yr favr of Mar 30 from
Norfolk	LOCATION	& tho ' I recd a Letter from Capt Brown of 10 days later date he does not mention one word of having any of yr Tobo , nor has my Br wrote me of having recd the 10 hhds from
Hipkins	LOCATION	, if he does in time they shall be insured as you direct .

		I now inclose you yr Acct Currt as you direct Ball .

		due to you # 11.4.3 which hope you will find right & note in conformity to mine .

		By this you will see how many of yr Bills have been paid .

		I have wrote you so fully & frequently respecting the insurance of the Fanny , that I can add nothing farther than to request you will direct me what to do with the Underwriters who still refuse to pay their subscriptions .

		In my Judgement they are clearly Liable , but , as the Law is always uncertain , for my own part , wd advise first to take the opinion of

M. GARNIER	PERSON	TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 8 June 1775 The dispatches which we expect directly from General
Gage	PERSON	have not arrived yet .

		A few ships which came from
Virginia	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	have confirmed the first news .

		We learned also that , prior to the engagement that took place on the 19th , they had received at
Boston	LOCATION	the formal addresses which both Houses of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	presented to the King of
England	LOCATION	early last February as well as the answer of His British Majesty .

		We learned further that
Boston	LOCATION	was surrounded by the insurgents and that 4,800 sailors seeing they were going to be deprived of their fishing rights , deserted their ships and joined their compatriots under arms .

		The supporters of the Government in the Province of
Massachussett	LOCATION	have abandoned this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	; several of them took refuge in
Halifax	LOCATION	and more than sixty embarked on the ship awaited by the Government .

		It is certain that as soon as it was learned in
New York	LOCATION	what had happened in the Province of
Massachussett	LOCATION	on the 19th , the inhabitants of this city unloaded by force two ships that were in their port carrying supplies for General
Gage	PERSON	and ready to sail .

		The next ships which will arrive from
Boston	LOCATION	will tell us more about the state of affairs ... The ship
Romney	PERSON	with 50 guns and the corvette
Marin	LOCATION	have just sailed from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	for
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		It is said that Mr. Secretary -LSB-
John -RSB- Pownall	PERSON	waited upon Capt. -LSB-
John -RSB- Darby	PERSON	, and desired him to attend Lord
Dartmouth	PERSON	, which he refused to do without an official letter , signifying his Lordship 's request , and for what purpose , assigning as a reason for this caution , `` That he had heard of instances , where , after having pumped every article of intelligence from persons in similar circumstances with himself , facts had been grossly misrepresented , and a very improper use made of the information ; he was determined therefore to have some authority for what he did , to justify himself to his countrymen in
America	LOCATION	, from any imputation that might be thrown on him hereafter , when the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	had made all the use of him they could . ''

		Not long since , a person was examined before a Great Board , and his evidence taken down in writing , a copy of which was given to him the next day to sign ; like a man of business , however , he chose to examine the contents of the paper before he gave it the sanction of his name ; the result was , that the sense and spirit of his declaration were gone , and a different meaning and construction were palpably given to every sentence of his evidence .

		The

Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	, which is rather more to the disadvantage of the Regulars than the Acct we had before .

		They say that the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	fired first , ` tho the contrary is proved by a number of authentic depositions , some of them sworn to by the Regulars themselves .

		If the people of

London	LOCATION	, 23 June 1775 The supplies for the army of General
Gage	PERSON	, which were seized by the rebels in
New York	LOCATION	, were considerable .

		They were worth 80,000 pound sterling .

		It is now necessary to send even the flour from
England	LOCATION	in order to support this army , and make use of the same means which would have been required for the conquest of
America	LOCATION	.

		The supply ships for the
Newfoundland	LOCATION	fishermen which ordinarily replenished in ports of the American Continent had to return empty .


England	LOCATION	can not depend at present on any source of supply in that part of the world .

		Such is , Sir , the position of this country , and yet the King of
England	LOCATION	is determined not to change his
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	, come what may , and I know this for a fact .

		For their part , the members of the Opposition hold so little doubt regarding the need for such a change that their principal leaders gathered only last week and disposed of all the posts :
Myd Chatham	LOCATION	wishes to become Prime Minister without portfolio in order to be able to govern more safely without having to shoulder the burden of the events ... I know for a fact that the Count de Velderen , Minister from
Holland	LOCATION	, has received a reproach from the English Ministry in regard to the complaisance with which the
United Provinces	LOCATION	catered to the needs of
New England	LOCATION	, to wit the supply of war ammunition .

		Indeed , we know for an actual fact that the rebels obtained 4,000 barrels of powder from
St. Eustatius	LOCATION	.

		These supplies , added to those of the same kind which they found in
New York	LOCATION	where they took 40 pieces of cannon , can not but encourage their venture .

England	LOCATION	towards the latter end of the Year , letting their Lordships know what Sort of Ships you would wish to be supplied with in their room in the Spring ; This point however of sending home the Great Ships their Lordships leave entirely to your discretion according as the necessity of the
Times & the Service	ORGANIZATION	may require but they wish to have your opinion thereupon by the very first conveyance that offers .

		Their Lordships upon discoursing with the Commissrs of the Victualling as to the dependance that may be had upon the Contract they have made for supplying the Ships under your command with Provisions , received from them the inclosed Copy of a Letter from Mr
Grant	PERSON	their Contractor which I send you for your information more especially as what he mentions respecting the use of fresh Provisions where they can be had seems to deserve your particular attention ; I am at the same time to acquaint you that in order to guard against any accidents their Lordships have directed the
Victualing Board	ORGANIZATION	to send out to you without delay a farther supply of Provisions for 5000 Men for 4 Months of all species except Spirits & to contract for a quantity of Rum to be delivered at
Boston	LOCATION	to answer the other Species , And their Lordships desire that you will , by the first conveyance that offers let them know what is the State of your Provisions ; what farther supplies you conceive may be necessary to be sent to you from hence ; And when and where you would wish to have them sent & c P S By the Viper ー See Comr .

		indeed we can scarcely be too frugal in these critical times .

		If
Messrs Chambers & Eilbacks Cargoe	ORGANIZATION	is all from the upper part of

		The paymts to be in 3 or 4 Mos after delivery by bills on
London	LOCATION	at 60 daies .

		I shd imagine the best method would be to get from the lowest term & then one may be able to make judge whether to accept or not and also it may be advisable to strike the bargain before the ship arrives , as it is possible she may bring advices that will raise their demand .

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 21st May , 1775 The Admiral wrote Letters to the captains of the
Fowey Tamer & Cruizer	ORGANIZATION	informing them that the Rebellion being almost general throughout the Provinces it behooved them to be very circumspect and attentive to his Majesty 's Interest ; to support the Kings Governors and civil Power established by
Law	PERSON	as long as they could and to assist and protect all other his Majesty 's faithful Subjects and their property ; but not to act offensively except for the immediate preservation of his Majesty 's Ships under their Command , or except upon the special Requisition of the civil Magistrates in cases of the utmost Danger .

		He however hoped that things would not remain much longer in this uncertain State , that either an accomodation would take place between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her Colonies , or effectual Measures be adopted to support the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	just authority in and over them all .

		He told
Captn -LSB- George -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	that the
Delaware	LOCATION	ought not to be left without a Kings Vessel , therefore , unless it was absolutely necessary to detain him longer to send Lieut -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Colins	PERSON	to his Station -LRB- to whom he also wrote -RRB- , and to continue to forward the Dispatches therewith delivered according to their several Addresses , and that he would have him take on Board as much Bread as he could possibly stow , as the fleet was very short of that Article , and direct Lieut.
Colins	PERSON	to do the same .

		He told Capt -LSB-
Edward -RSB- Thornborough	PERSON	that his last letter was come to hand dated March 7th acquainting him with what he had done towards repairing the defective parts of the
Tamer	LOCATION	and fishing his foremast ; that there was an end to all Correspondence by Land , & that he intended to send a Ship or Sloop to relieve him as soon as possible ; in the mean time it would be proper for him to be upon his guard , to have his Majesty 's Sloop under his Command in constant readiness for Action , and to keep his provisions compleat , particularly Bread , for all the Supplies to the Kings Ships were forbidden by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		He let captn -LSB-
Francis -RSB- Parry	PERSON	know that she had received his Letters with the State and Condition of his Majesty 's sloop Cruizer in Masts , Sails Rigging and other Stores , that from his representation he indeed appeared to be in a very unwarlike Condition ; he might therefore expect to be relieved very soon : In the mean time he must put her into the best Condition he could , take care not to be surprized by the Rebels , and get on board as much provision as he could conveniently stow , particularly Bread : that the
Otter	PERSON	was sent to
Virginia	LOCATION	, The
Tamer	PERSON	was still at
South Carolina	LOCATION	, and He must continue to give what Assistance and Protection he could to his Majesty 's Governor at
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		With the foregoing Letters the Admiral sent to each Captain a number of printed Accounts of the Battle of
Lexington	LOCATION	, which had been very falsely represented by the Provincials .

		2 He also wrote to the collector of the customs at
Salem	LOCATION	to let the town know that he would not press their sailors if they did not stop the supplies for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, & in order to facilitate and encourage the bringing to
Boston	LOCATION	of Hay , Lumber , Fuel and Provisions for the use of the
Garrison	PERSON	, the Admiral ordered that the calling of Vessels at
Salem	LOCATION	to enter should be dispensed with .

		The week before last Capt. -LSB-
John -RSB- Linzee	PERSON	, of the Falcon sloop of war , took two sloops on the coast between this place and the Vineyard , without the least reasonable pretence that we can learn ; upon which the people at the eastward manned out two other vessels , retook the sloops , and carried them into Fair Haven , in

Linzee	PERSON	's men , three of whom were wounded , which three were kept there , and taken good care of , and one other , who was a doctor 's mate , was kept to dress their wounds ; the others were sent to
Taunton	LOCATION	the next day .

		ー It is said the above sloops , being only in ballast , were to have been employed in carrying live stock from some of the islands of
Boston	LOCATION	for the use of the King 's troops .

		... The brig mentioned in our last to have come here for provisions for our enemies , we are assured came only to procure provisions , and other necessaries , for a fishing company at
Canso	ORGANIZATION	; but she will not take any provisions in , even for that purpose , there being several piratical cruisers stationed as 't is supposed , between this place and Cape-Cod , on purpose to take vessels with provisions ... The inhabitants of

		We are in great want of a number of seamen , gunners , carpenters , & c. , for both vessels .

		Our safety in a great measure depends on them , the vessels , as they will be able to command the lake if properly manned .

		I have judicious able , commanders for both vessels , and want only mates , gunners , marines , & c. Annexed is the wages I propose giving , but must refer that to your direction , and any sums you are kind enough to advance for the above purpose , I will give a draft for , on the

		On Wednesday evening last -LSB- May 17 -RSB- arrived here ,
John Brown	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	; from
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, express to the
General Congress	ORGANIZATION	, from whom we learn , that on the beginning of this instant , a company of about fifty men , from
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and the western part of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and joined by upwards of one hundred from
Bennington	LOCATION	, in New-York government , and the adjacent towns , proceeded to the eastern side of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, and on the night before the 11th current , crossed the Lake with 85 men , -LRB- not being able to obtain craft to transport the rest , -RRB- and about daybreak invested the fort , whose gate , contrary to expectation , they found shut , but the wicker open , through which , with the Indian war whoop , all that could , entered one by one , others scaling the wall on both sides of the gate , and instantly secured and disarmed the centries , and pressed into the parade , where they formed the Hollow square ; but immediately quitting that order , they rushed into the several barracks on three sides of the fort , and seized on the garrison , consisting of two officers , and upwards of forty privates , whom they brought out , disarmed , put under guard , and have since sent prisoners to
Hartford	LOCATION	, in
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		All this was performed in about ten minutes , without the loss of a life , or a drop of blood on our side , and but very little on that of the King 's troops .

		In the fort were found about thirty barrels of flour a few barrels of pork , seventy odd chests of leaden ball , computed at three hundred tuns , about ten barrels of powder in bad condition , near two hundred pieces of ordnances , of all sizes , from eighteen pounders downwards , at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	and Crown point , which last place , being held only by a corporal and eight men , falls of course into our hands .

		By this sudden expedition , planned by some principal persons in the four neighbouring colonies , that important pass is now in the hands of the Americans , where we trust the wisdom of the
Grand Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, will take effectual measures to secure it , as it may be depended on that administration means to form an army in
Canada	LOCATION	, composed of British regulars , French and Indians to attack the colonies on that side .

Post	ORGANIZATION	, that important Key of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, and must humbly ask Leave to suggest whether it might not be well for the Venerable Congress , our at present superior
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	, to reconsider the matter of giving up that
Post	ORGANIZATION	.

		Your Zeal , Union & Resolution , at this most critical Day , under the Almighty Blessing of Heaven , will I humbly yet confidently believe prove the

		It is interesting to note that
Ethan Allen	PERSON	, in his `` Narrative '' omits any account of this disastrous foray .

		His story reads : `` General
Arnold	PERSON	with the schooner , sailed faster than the bateaux , arrived at
St. Johns	LOCATION	and by surprise possessed himself of the sloop before I could arrive with the bateaux .

		He also made prisoners of a sergeant and twelve men who were garrisoned at that place .

		It is worthy of remark , that as soon as
General Arnold	ORGANIZATION	had secured the prisoners on board , and had made preparations for sailing , the wind , which but a few hours before was fresh in the south and well served to carry us to
St. Johns	PERSON	, now shifted and came fresh from the north ; and in about one hour 's time , General
Arnold	PERSON	sailed with the prize and schooner for Ticonderoga .

		When I met him with my party , within a few miles of
St. Johns	LOCATION	, he saluted me with a discharge of cannon , which I returned with a volley of small arms .

		This being repeated three times , I went on board the sloop with my party , where several loyal
Congress	ORGANIZATION	healths were drank .

		We were now masters of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	and the garrison depending thereon . ''

		MASSACHUSETTS SPY , WEDNESDAY , MAY 24 , 1775
Worcester	LOCATION	, May 24 -LSB- 1775 -RSB- The week before last , the Falcon sloop of war , was cruising about
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, and meeting with a wood sloop , in ballast , seized her , but promising the Skipper to release him and his vessel if he would give information of any vessel that was just arrived from the
West-Indies	LOCATION	with a cargo on board , he at length told the Captain of the
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	that there was a sloop at
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	, which has just arrived ; whereupon the Captain of the Falcon , instead of releasing the wood sloop , armed and manned her , and sent her in search of the West-Indiaman ; they found the vessel lying at anchor , but her cargo was landed ; however , they seized her and carried her off after putting part of their crew and some guns and ammunition on board .

		Notice of this getting on shore , the people fitted out a third sloop , with about thirty men and two swivel guns , and went in pursuit of these royal pirates , whom they come up with at
Martha 's Vineyard	LOCATION	, where they lay at anchor at about a league 's distance from each other ; the first surrendered without firing a gun , our people after putting a number of hands on board , bore down upon the other , which by this time had got under sail , but the people in the
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	sloop coming up with her , the pirates fired upon them ; the fire was immediately returned , by which three of the pirates were wounded , among whom was the commanding officer ; our people boarded her immediately , and having taken both sloops , carried them into
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	, and sent the prisoners to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, from whence nine of them were yesterday brought to this Town .


PORTIA	PERSON	-LRB-
ABIGAIL ADAMS	PERSON	-RRB- TO
JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- 24 May B -LSB- raintre -RSB- e 1775 Suppose you have had a formidable account of the alarm we had last Sunday morning -LSB- May 21 -RSB- .

		When I rose about six oclock I was told that the Drums had been some time beating and that 3 allarm Guns were fired , that
Weymouth Bell	ORGANIZATION	had been ringing , and Mr.
Welds	PERSON	was then ringing .

		I immediately sent of -LSB- f -RSB- an express to know the occasion , and found the whole Town in confusion .

		3 Sloops and one cutter had come out , and draped anchor just below
Great Hill	LOCATION	.

		It was difficult to tell their design , some supposed they were coming to
Germantown	LOCATION	others to
Weymouth	LOCATION	.

		People women children from the Iron Works flocking down this Way ー every woman and child above or from below my Fathers .

		My Fathers family flying , the Drs. in great distress , as you may well immagine for my Aunt had her Bed thrown into a cart , into which she got herself , and ordered the boy to drive her of -LSB- f -RSB- to
Bridgwater	PERSON	which he did .

		The report was to them , that 300 hundred had landed , and were upon their march into Town .

		The allarm flew -LSB- like -RSB- lightning , and men from all parts came flocking down till 2000 were collected ー but it seems their expidition was to
Grape Island	LOCATION	for
Levet	PERSON	's hay .

		There it was impossible to reach them for want of Boats , but the sight of so many persons , and the fireing at them prevented their getting more than 3 ton of Hay , tho they had carted much more down to the water .

		At last they musterd a Lighter , and a Sloop from
Hingham	LOCATION	which had six port holes .

		Our men eagerly jumpt on board , and put of -LSB- f -RSB- for the Island .

		As soon as they perceived it , they decamped .

		Our people landed upon -LSB- the -RSB- Island , and in an instant set fire to the Hay which with the
Barn	LOCATION	was soon consumed , about 80 ton tis said .

		We expect soon to be in continual alarms , till something decisive takes place .

		We wait with longing Expectation in hopes to hear the best accounts from you with regard to union and harmony & c .

		We rejoice greatly on the Arival of Doctor -LSB-
Benjamin -RSB- Franklin	PERSON	, as he must certainly be able to inform you very perticuliarly of the situation of affairs in
England	LOCATION	.

		I wish you would -LSB- write -RSB- if you can get time ; be as perticuliar as you may , when you write ー every one here abouts come -LSB- s -RSB- to me to hear what accounts I have .

		I was so unlucky a not to get the Letter you wrote at
New York	LOCATION	.


Capn	PERSON	.


Beals	PERSON	forgot it , and left it behind .

		We have a flying report here with regard to
New York	LOCATION	, but can not give any credit to it , as yet , that they had been engaged with the Ships which -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	sent there and taken them with great loss upon both sides .

		2 Yesterday we have an account of 3 Ships comeing in to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I believe it is true , as there was a Salute from the other Ships , tho I have not been able to learn from whence they come .

		Suppose you have had an account of the fire which did much damage to the Warehouses , and added greatly to the distresses of the inhabitants whilst it continued .

		The bad conduct of General
Gage	PERSON	was the means of its doing so much damage .

		Our House has been upon this alarm in the same Scene of confusion that it was upon the first ー Soldiers comeing in for lodging , for Breakfast , for Supper , for Drink & c. & c. Sometimes refugees from
Boston	LOCATION	tierd and fatigued , seek an assilum for a Day or Night , a week ー you can hardly imagine how we live .

NEW ENGLAND	LOCATION	CHRONICLE , THURSDAY , MAY 25 , 1775
Cambridge	LOCATION	, May 25 Last Sabbath -LRB- May 21 -RSB- about 10 o'Clock A.M. an Express arrived at General -LSB-
John -RSB- Thomas	PERSON	's Quarters in
Roxbury	LOCATION	, informing him that four Sloops -LRB- two of them armed -RRB- were sailed from
Boston	LOCATION	, to the
South Shore of the Bay	LOCATION	, and that a Number of Soldiers were landing at
Weymouth	LOCATION	.

		Gen.
Thomas	PERSON	ordered 3 Companies to march to the Support of the Inhabitants .

		When arrived , they found the Soldiers had not attempted to land at
Weymouth	LOCATION	; but had landed on
Grape-Island	LOCATION	, from whence they were carrying off Hay on board the sloops .

		The
People of Weymouth	ORGANIZATION	assembled on a Point of Land next to
Grape Island	LOCATION	.

		The distance from
Weymouth Shore	LOCATION	to said island was too great for small Arms to do Execution ; nevertheless , our Ptlople frequently fired .

		The fire was returned from one of the Vessels with swivel Guns , but the Shot passed over our Heads , and did no Mischief .

		Matters continued in this State for several Hours , the Soldiers pulling the Hay down to the Water-Side , our People firing at the Vessel , and they now and then discharging swivel Guns .

		The Tide was now come in , and several Lighters which were aground , where got afloat , upon which our People , who were ardent for Battle , got on board , hoisted Sail , and bore directly down upon the nearest Point of the Island .

		The Soldiers and Sailors Immediately left the
Barn	LOCATION	, and made for their Boats , and put off from one End of the
Island	LOCATION	, whilst our People landed on the other .

		The Sloops hoisted Sail with all possible Expedition , whilst our People set Fire to the Barn , and burnt 70 or 80 Tons of Hay ; then fired several Tons which had been pulled down to the Water-Side , and brought off the Cattle .

		ー As the Vessels passed Horse Neckk , a Sort of Promontory which extends from
Germantown	LOCATION	, they fired their Swivels and small Arms at our People pretty briskly , but without Effect , though one of the Bullets from their small Arms , which passed over our People , struck against a Stone with such Force , as to take off a large Part of the Bullet .

		Whether any of the Enemy were wounded , is uncertain , though it is reported three of them were .

		It is thought they did not carry off more than one or two Tons of hay .

William -RSB- Howe	PERSON	, -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Clinton	PERSON	, and -LSB-
John -RSB- Burgoyne	PERSON	, and the Acts of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	for restraining the Trade of the Colonies arrived from
England	LOCATION	.

		Great Difficulties now arose in procuring Fuel , not only for present consumption but for the next Winter .

		The Committees of Safety prevented the
Garrison	PERSON	being supplied either with firing or fresh Provisions , and pronounced all those who in any Manner assisted us Enemies to their Country , but indeed publick Restrictions for this purpose were altogether unnecessary , the bulk of the people being through wicked Misrepresentations , sufficiently disposed to distress the Kings forces : And this disposition among the Country people rendered our dependance for Fuel and fresh provisions very precarious .

		It has already been mentioned that the Admiral had allowed all Coasting Vessels laden with any sort of Provisions or fuel to enter
Boston Harbour	LOCATION	without touching at
Salem	LOCATION	; but all Vessels from abroad laden with dutiable goods were as usual to enter at the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	at
Salem	LOCATION	, and then the Kings Ships -LRB- having Orders for that purpose -RRB- brought them round to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The Indulgence to the Coasters was however soon found ineffectual , for , under pretence of fears from their own Countrymen , very few cared to supply us , although the extravagant prices given for the Commodities wanted stimulated them to come in .

		But the Committees along the Coast to the Eastward presently took a certain method to hinder the
Kings Army	ORGANIZATION	from being supplied , which was to seize all the Craft found so employed and imprison the People , and to direct that all coasting Vessels -LRB- except a few absolutely necessary to carry fuel to
Marblehead	LOCATION	,
Salem	PERSON	& c -RRB- should be laid up , and their Sails and
Ruders	PERSON	deposited in particular places ; so that we had only two ways of getting firing , the uncertain one of intercepting their small Vessels creeping along shore , which now and then happened , and to take it by force .

		The general indisposition of the Americans towards us appeared likewise in the affair of masts on which subject the Admiral wrote to Captn -LSB-
Andrew -RSB- Barkley	PERSON	at
Piscataqua	LOCATION	& to Govr -LSB-
Francis -RSB- Legge	PERSON	.

PISCATAQUA	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	25 May 1775 I have received your Letters of the 10 , 18 & 19 of May with their Inclosures .

		It would have been impossible for you to have brought away the Masts , when three hundred men were asembled to prevent it ; but , suppose with the loss of Men you had effected it , the Consequences would have been destruction to every other Mast marked for the King ; and I really do not at present see the use of the Governors acquainting you with a proceeding of the Rebels detrimental to his Majesty 's Interest , when he at the same time had no request to make concerning it , and did not think it adviseable for you to attempt the preventing the Masts being carried higher up the River .

		I very much approve and commend Lieutenant -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Mowat	PERSON	's intrepid and Officerlike Conduct at
Falmouth	LOCATION	; The Behaviour of Mr
Hogg	PERSON	also deserves great Commendations ; That Transaction ought to be a caution to all Officers not to trust themselves in the Hands of Rebels , who carry on War like no other People upon Earth .

		It was quite right to despatch the Canceaux to
Halifax	LOCATION	, as you was not apprized of the Tartar being there expressly for the purpose of guarding that
Arsenal	ORGANIZATION	.

		I do not recollect Mr
Parry	PERSON	verbally desiring my Application to your Excellency to grant him a License to cut Masts and other Timber in the Kings Woods ; I am sure he made no such request in writing ; In either case I should readily have wrote to your Excellency for that purpose .

		As the Rebels in general seem determined to distress his
Majesty 's Service	ORGANIZATION	by every Means in their Power , tho ' eventually to their own Ruin , and those within your Excellency 's do not think fit to allow the Masts already cut to be under care of the King 's Ships , Mr

JONATHAN TRUMBULL	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF
CONNECTICUT	LOCATION	, TO THE MASSACHUSETTS PROVINCIAL CONGRESS 1 Your letter of the Seventeenth Instant with the In closed resolve of the
Provincial Congress of Massachusetts Bay	ORGANIZATION	, was delivered to me by
Colo -LSB- James -RSB- Easton	PERSON	, and communicated to the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, who have desired me to return their Congratulations on the Reduction of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, a Fortress truly Important , and to assure you they entertain a proper Sense of the Merit of those Officers and Soldiers by whose bravery and good Conduct it was achieved .

		As this Advantage was gained by the united Counsels and Enterprize of a number of private Gentlemen in your province ー
New Hampshire	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, Prompted only by a zeal for the Liberty of their Country without
Public Authority	ORGANIZATION	, to our Knowledge , and is of Great and general Importance to the
united Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, it was thought best to take the Advice of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	upon the Manner of treating it in future , both by the
General Assembly of this Colony & the Committee	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, as well as by you ー Dispatches were accordingly sent to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and the Sentiments of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	thereon hath been receiv 'd this day , by Express , with a Letter from the
Committee of New York	ORGANIZATION	, Copies of which , enclosed , are herewith sent you By them you will see , the present Custody of that Fortress is committed to the Province of
New York	LOCATION	, with the Assistance of the
New England Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, if needed The
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	beheld your Situation with Concern and a fixed Resolution to Contribute every thing in their power to Your Defence and preservation , and as far as apertains to them , are willing & desirous you should have the benefit of such Artillery as may be spared from the Fortresses of Crown point and
Ticonderoga	PERSON	; but , as they do not consider themselves as in titled to the Command of those places , they can not take upon themselves to give Orders for the removal of the heavy Cannon that may be spared , without the Concurrence of the other Colonies Interested in them The Necessity of Securing and maintaining the Posts on the Lakes for the Defence of the Frontiers becomes daily more evident from the reiterated Intelligence we receive of the Plan formed by Our Enemies to distress us by Inroads of Canadians and
Savages	PERSON	from the Province of Quebec upon the Adjacent Settlements , the enclosed Copy of a Letter from Our Delegates Attending at
New York	LOCATION	to communicate measures with the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
that City	LOCATION	throws an Additional Light on this Subject and is thought worthy to be communicated to you .

		Whilst the Designs of our Enemies Against us , fill us with Concern , we can not omit to observe the smiles of
Providence	LOCATION	upon us , in revealing their wicked Plans , and hitherto prospering the Attempts of the Colonies to frustrate them .

		With a humble reliance on the Continuance of Divine Favour and Protection to the Cause , of the Justice of which a Doubt can not be entertained , The
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	of this Colony are ready to cooperate with the other Colonies in every Exertion for their Common Defence , and to contribute their Proportion of Men & other Necessarys for maintaining the Posts on the Frontiers or Defending or repelling Invasions in any other Quarter , agreably to the Advice of the

		This is the first mention of American marines during the Revolutionary War period .

		Why there should be marines on May 13 , 1775 , more than a month before
Connecticut	LOCATION	even considered commissioning vessels of war , and why these marines should be found in the inland city of
Hartford	LOCATION	is difficult to comprehend .

		The theory that they might have been enlisted for service on
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	is untenable , as Governor
Skene	PERSON	's schooner , subsequently named the Liberty , was not taken up at
Skenesborough	LOCATION	until the very day that Roman 's letter arrived in
Hartford	LOCATION	, so there could have been no knowledge of her capture .

		In
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	's letter of May 26 , 1775 , to the
Massachusetts Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	, they are identified as eight gentlemen `` who are Seamen . ''

		It is probable , therefore , that the use of the word `` marines '' had been a figure of speech by
Jesse Root	PERSON	, whose rhetorical flourishes are apparent throughout his letter .

		Mr.

		that a letter be wrote to the inhabitants of the northern counties , to the same purport as the postscript to the letter to the Governor and Company of

John Morin	PERSON	-RSB-
Scott	PERSON	and
Colo.	LOCATION	-LSB-
Abraham -RSB- Ten Broeck	PERSON	, was read .

		Ordered , That Mr.

Ten Broeck	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	, who with leave , went to confer with Messrs. -LSB-
Nathaniel -RSB- Wales	PERSON	, -LSB-
Thaddeus -RSB- Burr	PERSON	, and -LSB-
Pierpont -RSB- Edwards	PERSON	, the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	of the Colony of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, returned and reported from their memory to this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that they had conferred with those gentlemen , who informed them that they had detained Mr. President 's Letter to their Governor and company , relative to
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, till this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	could be informed of the following facts , to wit : That their
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	is not now sitting ; that their recess was supplied by a council of war , with limited powers ; that the said council have only authority to direct the movement of their troops but not to appoint any command .

		That their
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	had destined three hundred men to be quartered at
Salisbury	LOCATION	, who probably would be allotted to assist in maintaining the fortress at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, if necessary ; that the persons who had taken that post were not any part of their regular troops , but adventurers ; that among these Colonel
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	, from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and Captain -LSB- Asa -RSB-
Douglas	PERSON	, who lives on the line between that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	and this , were present at the capture ; that Captain
Douglass	PERSON	was a principal , and had great merit in the success of the enterprise ; that almost all the rest of the adventurers were inhabitants of this Colony ; that they were confident their council of war would not take upon them to appoint any person to take the command of that post ; that besides , they were apprehensive that the people now there probably would dispute the delivering up that fortress to any person appointed by their council of war ; that it was impossible for the said council of war to grant us any other assistance than the three hundred men above mentioned , which they judged insufficient to maintain that post ; that Captain
Douglass	PERSON	is guardian of the
Stockbridge Indians	ORGANIZATION	, and had great influence over and almost the entire direction of them ; that he is a person of great influence in that quarter ; that he had raised for the enterprise two hundred men at his own expense , and could in ten or twelve days augment them to seven hundred , all of which except one hundred would be inhabitants of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	; that they recommended Capt.
Douglass	PERSON	as meriting the attention of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; that they thought it necessary for this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to appoint to the command of the abovementioned post , and that in that case their council of war would have it in their power to supply the above mentioned assistance for that service .

		Which Report being made , Mr.
Scott	PERSON	moved that the letter to the Governor and Company of the English Colony of
Connecticut	LOCATION	be withheld and the subject matter thereof reconsidered .

		This motion being seconded , a debate thereon arose , after which the question was put , whether the said letter should be withheld , and the subject matter thereof reconsidered .

		And on a division , the said question carried in the negative .

		The draft of a Letter to the agents for superintending the removal of the cannon and stores from
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	was read and approved , and is in the words following , to wit : In Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, at
New York	LOCATION	, May 25th , 1775 .

		Gent ー By the recommendation of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	respecting
Ticonderoga	PERSON	, already forwarded to the committee of your county , and by our resolution thereon , you will readily perceive the expediency of appointing proper persons to superintend the business therein mentioned , who will undertake it with cheerfulness , diligence , and dispatch .

		This
Congress	ORGANIZATION	being convinced that persons in the vicinage of
Albany	LOCATION	would be most proper to put in execution the directions of the
Congresses	ORGANIZATION	, left it to the Deputies of your county , now here convened , to propose some fit men for the approbation of this

		2 .

		After that is fixed upon among yourselves , that you will then immediately repair to those places , either by yourselves or such fit persons as you know can and will complete the business effectually and reasonably .

		3 .

		It will be necessary that you have an armourer or engineer whose skill ought to determine which of the cannon are useless , that such may remain where they be , and no expence arise from them .

WILLIAM REYNOLDS	PERSON	TO
GEORGE FLOYD NORTON	PERSON	1
Dear Norton Virginia	ORGANIZATION	25th May 1775 My last was the 20th April P Capt McCunn since wch I am favour 'd with your two letters of 17th
Jany	PERSON	and 18th March the last P
Capt Robertson	PERSON	, who went up
Rappahanock	PERSON	yesterday .

		I observe what you say relative to that unhappy Circumstance of the Tea , believe me my friend that matter has not given me a little Concern & sorry I was to observe some other disagreeable Resolves lately published from Gloster owing to your Fathers letter of Justification not being published the first week after the Arrival of the
Virginia	LOCATION	, which I understand your Brother was persuaded from doing .

		I heartily agree with you that
Prentis	PERSON	was the Person who ought to have suffer 'd severely for his neglect in not countermanding that order .

		I was one of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	on the Arrival of that Ship , and exerted my utmost Endeavours , making use of every Argument to excuse yr Fathers Conduct , which was construed partiallity & I was accordingly left out at the next
Choice of Committee Men	ORGANIZATION	, a matter of little moment to me I can assure you , for I never wish to fill a place where I can not speak my sentiments without Censure .

		I meant the Resolves previous to those in August , which you say you never read , there I can not altogether acquit you , as you must have been remiss in not noticing them .

		I am sensible the obtaining leave of the Commissioners to reland the Tea when the Ship was at
Gravesend	LOCATION	, woud have been attended with a good deal of trouble & Expence , but as things have turned out I do sincerely wish it had been done , I never thought your Father had any other design in shipping the Tea but to comply strictly with the order of his Correspondent , who behaved ungenerously in involving your house in a difficulty he might so easily have prevented .

		You say your friends did not treat you well in not writing you sooner the unhappy fate of that Ship .

		I fully expected your Brother wou 'd have wrote your Father particularly or I undoubtedly shou 'd have done it .

		believe he was at the time unwell & under a good deal of concern , beside the determination on the Ship was for sometime in suspence .

		I am fully persuaded , indeed am convinced if your Brother & Mr
Prentis	PERSON	on their first hearing of the Arrival of the Tea , had appeard active in destroying it , the People wou 'd have look 'd over it and the Tea Ship been allowed to load .

		I am warmly attached to your Brother , & from the many obligations I am under to your Father & Mother .

		Gratitude & the sincere regard I have for the Interest of your house wou 'd tempt me to go any lengths to serve you , but I am really sorry to be obliged to say your
Brothers Conduct	ORGANIZATION	is not so pleasing to the People in general as I cou 'd wish to be sure he has a most difficult part to act a Man situated as he is to collect money and at the same time solicit Consignments must be posses 'd of a great deal of patience & moderation not sometimes by an unguarded Expression to disoblige , for you must well know the family Connections in this Colony are so numerous , that if a person offends one they dont know where it may stop .

		I am sorry to find by your letter & the late papers that matters are not likely to be accomodated our Assembly are to meet the 1st day of next Month but suppose will be soon dissolved as I apprehend the Governor has nothing agreeable to propose he has made himself exceedingly disagreeable to the People by his late behaviour in regard to the powder & his letters wrqte home , it is said he has wrote to General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	for a Regiment to guard him and if they shou 'd come , God knows what will be the consequence for I am satisfied if they are quarter 'd on the Inhabitants of this Town or
Williamsburg	LOCATION	it will inflame the minds of the People so sufficiently , that I dread the thought of what may happen , the rifle Men in the upper Counties are prepared to assist us at the shortest Notice O that the wicked cursed Ministry wou 'd but relent , ere it be too late and save a number of poor innocent People who must unhappily fall Victims to the designs of a few Men who are a disgrace to human nature .

		I shall endeavour to give
Esten & Robertson	ORGANIZATION	all the Assistance in my power tho ' am really fearfull Tobo will not answer at the high price it is now selling at .

		In your last you dont mention a word about Tobacco .

		I wrote your
J.N. & Co	ORGANIZATION	16th past by this same opportunity expecting the Ship wou 'd sail sooner as this goes by the way of
Glasgow	LOCATION	I ca n't send you the papers , Mrs.
Reynolds	PERSON	& myself are exceedingly obliged to you for your kind wishes towards us , how long we may live to enjoy them from the present complexion of Affairs is very uncertain , pray present our respects to your Mother & ca .

		& be assured that I remain unalterably Yours -LSB- & c. -RSB- -LSB- P.S. -RSB- pray remember me to Mr
Withers	PERSON	, I am obliged to you for the News paper , but you made a mistake instead of inclosing the Fishery bill you send me the

Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 26th -LSB- May 1775 -RSB- There was however in
Boston	LOCATION	a Mr
Ichabod Jones	PERSON	, who , having some property about
Machias	LOCATION	, imagined from his acquaintances and influence with the People there that he could furnish the
Army	ORGANIZATION	with a considerable quantity of Firewood , he accordingly entered into a Contract for that purpose , and the General applied to the Admiral for an armed Vessel to go with and protect such Vessels as should be sent with Mr
Jones	PERSON	on this Service : The Margueritta armed Schooner was appointed and had orders accordingly , being manned and equipped as expressed in the Admirals Letter to Mr Secretary
Stephens	PERSON	; But the event proved how totally mistaken Mr
Jones	PERSON	was in the temper of his Countrymen , and also shewed what we had generally to expect .

		The restraining Acts were distributed among the Fleet with the Admirals Orders to send all Vessels seized either by virtue of the Acts , or by the Admirals particular Orders to
Boston	LOCATION	: All Vessels laden with Lumber , Melasses or Salt were directed to be brought in .

		OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE CITY OF

Albany Committee Chamber	ORGANIZATION	, 26th May 1775 We now shall take notice of the New-York committee 's letter to us of the 20th inst. , enclosing the resolutions of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	; from which we find that the reduction of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, by our forces , is approved of , and recommending us to proceed , with all possible dispatch , with a sufficient body of forces , & c. to the northward , to remove the cannon and stores from
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	to the south end of
Lake George	LOCATION	.

		We are now busy to raise two companies , each company composed of fifty men , in order to go upon said expedition ; who we expect will be in readiness to march in two or three days .

		But , gentlemen , there are a number of very material difficulties that immediately arise : we have no ammunition ; all the powder already gone up , with what we can possible collect yet among us , will not amount to above 250 pounds ; and with so small a quantity , it is impossible for us to do anything of consequence .

		Nor can we possibly conceive how the Provincial forces can maintain these northern posts or withstand the attack of the British Troops from
Quebec	LOCATION	, who are , from the best intelligence we can collect , preparing as fast as possible to come down in order to retake these places from us ー an enterprise , if by them , undertaken and completed , will introduce our enemies into the very bowels of our country .

		We beg of you , gentlemen , without delay , to take these important matters into your most serious and immediate consideration , and afford us the necessary assistance in this our distressed situation ; and send us up , with all possible speed , a sufficient quantity of powder , without which nothing can possibly be done .

		We likewise stand in need of blankets , pitch , tar , oakum , nails , spikes , gin , ropes , camp kettles , entrenching tools , & c. and some rice , oatmeal , barley & c. ; also , for the sloop and schooner , two mates , two gunners , two gunner 's mates , two boatswains , and eighteen seamen , agreeable to Col.
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	's list copy enclosed no. 15 , all which you 'll be pleased to cause to be sent up to us with all possible dispatch ... We would mention another matter to you , which , in our humble opinion , requires your immediate consideration , that as the vessel from St.
John	PERSON	's has lately been taken by our forces , and whereof the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	have had no intelligence , on the 18th instant , when they entered into the resolution respecting
Ticonderoga	PERSON	, and removing the stores and cannon from thence to
Lake George	LOCATION	, whether it would not be expedient to fortify the latter instead of the former , as
Ticonderoga	PERSON	is by far the strongest and most important fortress .

		Notwithstanding the most tempting baits hav been thrown out , we were happy , for a time to find that only four , and those the worst of our men have been warped from their Duty and allegiance , but within these three days we have lost as many more , and I am apprehensive of the whole , unless we are soon removed or reinforced .

		As matters are thus situated , I am also of opinion Sir , that this Detachment should go on board the
Asia	LOCATION	Man of War ; But in this , I am to be directed by your orders & advise .

		`` A CIRCUMSTANTIAL ACCOUNT OF THE LATE BATTLE AT
CHELSEA	LOCATION	,
HOG ISLAND	LOCATION	, & c. '' 1 On Saturday last -LSB- May 27 -RSB- a party of the American army at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, to the number of between 2 and 300 men , had orders to drive off the live stock from Hog and
Noddle 's Island	LOCATION	, which lie near
Chelsea	LOCATION	and
Winnesimmet	LOCATION	, on the N.E. side of
Boston	LOCATION	harbour .

		ー From
Chelsea	PERSON	to
Hog Island	LOCATION	, at low water , it is but a ; bout knee high , and from that to
Noddle	PERSON	's
Island	ORGANIZATION	about the same ー The stock on the former belonged to Mr.
Oliver Wendell	PERSON	, at
Boston	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Jonathan Jackson	PERSON	, at
Newbury-Port	LOCATION	; that on
Noddle	PERSON	's island was owned by Mr.
-- Williams	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, who hires the Island .

		About 11 o'clock , A.M. between 20 and 30 men went from
Chelsea	PERSON	to
Hog Island	LOCATION	, and from thence to
Noddle	PERSON	's
Island	LOCATION	, to drive off the stock which was there , but were interrupted by a schooner and a sloop , dispatched from the fleet in
Boston	LOCATION	harbour , and 40 marines , who had been stationed on the island to protect the live stock ー However , they sent off 2 fine English stalions , 2 colts , and 3 cows ; killed 15 horses , 2 colts , and 3 cows , burnt a large barn , full of salt hay , and an old farm house : By this time they were fired on from the schooner and sloop , and a large number of marines in boats , sent from the several men of war ; upon which they retreated to a ditch on the marsh , and kept themselves undiscovered , till they had an opportunity to fire on the marines , when they shot down two dead , and wounded two more , one of whom died soon after .

		They then retreated to
Hog Island	LOCATION	, where they were joined by the remainder of their party from
Chelsea	LOCATION	, and drove off all the stock thereon , viz. between 3 and 400 sheep and lambs , some cows , horses , & c. During this , there were firings between the provincials and the schooner , Sloop , boats , and marines on the other island .

		ー Having cleared
Hog Island	LOCATION	, the provincials drew up on
Chelsea Neck	PERSON	, and sent for a reinforcement of 300 men , and 2 pieces of cannon -LRB- four pounders -RRB- which arrived about 9 o'clock in the evening ; soon after which , General -LSB-
Israel	LOCATION	-RSB-
Putnam	PERSON	went down and hailed the schooner , and told the people that , if they would submit , they should have good quarters , which the schooner returned with 2 cannon shot ; this was immediately answered with 2 cannon from the provincials : ー Upon this a very heavy fire ensued from both sides , which lasted until 11 o'clock at night , when the fire from the schooner ceased , the fire from the shore being so hot , that her people were obliged to quit her , and take to the boats , a great number of which had been sent from the ships to their assistance , and also a large reinforcement of marines , sent to
Noddle	PERSON	's Island , with 2 twelve pounders .

		The schooner 2 being thus left , drove ashore , where about break of day , the provincials carried some hay under her stern , and set her on fire , the sloop keeping up a small fire upon them ; at which time a heavy cannonading was begun , at
Noddle 's Island	LOCATION	hill , with the 12 pounders upon the provincials ; also General
Putnam	PERSON	kept a heavy fire upon the sloop , which disabled her much , and killed many of her men , so that she was obliged to be tow 'd off by the boats , when the firing ceased , excepting a few shot which were exchanged between the party at
Chelsea	LOCATION	, and the marines on
Noddle	PERSON	's Island .

		ー Thus ended this long action , without the loss of one provincial , and only four wounded by the bursting of his own gun , another only lost his little finger .

		ー The loss of the enemy amounted to 30 killed and 50 wounded .

		ー The provincials took out of the schooner 4 double fortified 4 pounders , twelve swivels , chief of her rigging and sails , many clothes , some money , & c. which the sailors and marines left behind , they having quitted in great haste .

		It becomes every day more and more necessary to exert the utmost Vigilance to prevent not only secret but open Attempts to destroy it .

		The burning of Hay in your Neighbourhood gives me a very unfavourable Idea of the Loyalty of the Inhabitants , and as you can not but imagine every Stratagem will be tried to destroy the only
Naval Magazine	LOCATION	we have on the
Continent of America	ORGANIZATION	, I must repeat my Orders for your taking every Step you think proper for its Security , always having in Remembrance that you are Kept at
Halifax	LOCATION	for that purpose and must be answerable for its Safety ; therefore as things are situated I am sure you do not expect a Compliance with your Request to be absent : Upon a Service of such consequence and at a time like this , every Soul must attend strictly to their Duty .

		If the Tartar is not provided with the allowed Number of Boats I have no Objection to her being furnished from the Yard , but my regard to the whole will not admit of a partial Indulgence to the detriment of the Service in General .

		The Ships are all in want of Boats and particularly Cutters , and the exactest distribution must be observed .

Boston	LOCATION	to an
Island	LOCATION	near
Weymouth	LOCATION	, in order to take on board a Quantity of Hay that had been procun :d for the Use of the ministerial Army ー They were discovered early on Sunday Morning , when a Number of the Inhabitants put off for the Island in a Gondola , who drove the Enemy on board their Vessels , burnt a large Quantity of Hay , and brought off a Number of Cattle which they had ty 'd , ー Our People fired on them briskly , and a Person since from
Boston	LOCATION	says , that three Men were carried in mortally wounded ; they returned the Fire with Swivels and small Arms , but did no Execution , and got only one Ton of Hay , which they had taken in before they were opposed .

		ー The Wind and Tide favoured the Enemy greatly , otherwise it is thought none of them would have escaped .

		ー The Firing and burning of the Hay occasioned an Alarm through the Country , and vast Bodies of Provincials were on their March towards

		Mr

Treadwell	PERSON	and Mr
Jacob Sheaffe Junr	PERSON	present a Memorial from themselves & others Merchts Freeholders & other Inhabitants of this Town setting forth that two Vessels laden with Provisions contracted for by some Merchts for the Supply of the Inhabitants were detained by His Majesty 's
Ship Scarborough	PERSON	to be sent to
Boston & ct &	ORGANIZATION	praying that his
Excy & Honrs	ORGANIZATION	would interfere to liberate said Vessels & Cargoes ー The Memorialists declare themselves very apprehensive of the most alarming Consequences from this Measure that in the present immediate Want of Provisions in this & the neighbouring Towns the immediate assembling of large Bodies of People is to be apprehended and fatal Consequences dreaded .

		The
Council	ORGANIZATION	having fully considered and deliberated upon the Matter are of opinion , That the Poor of this and the neighbouring Towns are in the greatest want of Corn and other Provisions ー and it appearing that the Cargoes of said Vessels have been contracted for for their relief and sustenance and also for the supply of the Inhabitants The
Council	ORGANIZATION	are convinced there is the greatest Reason on these Accounts to apprehend the most viole , nt outrages and tumults of the People will immediately follow this Detention of their Provisions the Consequences of which will be most probably very fatal to His Majesty 's Service , by bringing into the most imminent Danger the Lives and Properties of His Servants which ought by all means to be prevented if possible .

		The
Council	ORGANIZATION	therefore think it their Duty to advise Your Excellency will be pleased to acquaint Capt. -LSB-
Andrew -RSB- Barkley	PERSON	of these circumstances , not doubting but he will perceive that No general Orders can be intended to authorize him to cut off the Provisions actually procured for the necessary Sustenance of the Poor and Inhabitants of this Town , or impower him to interrupt the peaceable Subjects of His Majesty in this Province in pursuing their lawful Commerce .

NEWPORT MERCURY	LOCATION	, MONDAY , MAY 29 , 1775
Newport	LOCATION	, May 29 .

		Last Wednesday night -LSB- May 24 -RSB- the sloop Collector , Capt.
Nicholas Webster	PERSON	, sailed from this port for
Boston	LOCATION	, with a quantity of salt provisions , for the use of the standing army there ; & a number of sheep ; but for whose use these were is as yet uncertain .

		It is reported , that said sloop & salt provisions were taken into the custody of one of the ships of war here , and sent by her to
Boston	LOCATION	; but how that matter is , by whom those sheep were shipped , and for whose use , all-discovering TIME may unfold .

		ー The
Committee of Inspection	ORGANIZATION	, we hear , have taken the affair of the sheep into their consideration .

		Extract of a letter from a gentleman in
Providence	LOCATION	, dated May 25 .

		It is strongly suspected here , that the provisions on board
Webster	PERSON	were really purchased for the King 's service , and that the Capture was a SHAM .

		If this be not the truth of the case , pray set it in a true light , for the report spreads fast ; and as surely as it is believed that the ENEMY is supplied from
Newport	LOCATION	, will every supply for that town be stopped from every colony upon the continent .

		Last Saturday -LSB- May 20 -RSB- put in here , the ship
Peggy	LOCATION	, Capt.
William Baron	PERSON	, in 28 days from
Baltimore	LOCATION	, in
Maryland	LOCATION	: This vessel was bound to
Cork	PERSON	, with a load of flour and Indian corn , 't is said , but having contrary winds , was likely to fall short of wood & water .

		She is now in custody of the men of war in this harbour , and we hear is to be sent to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Another ship , said to be from
Virginia	LOCATION	, loaded with wheat , & c. was lately taken , near
Nantucket	LOCATION	, by the Falcon sloop of war , and sent to
Boston	LOCATION	; this ship was said to be bound to
Europe	LOCATION	.

		1 That two ships , bound from
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Maryland	LOCATION	to
Europe	LOCATION	, should , at this juncture , fall in with
Nantucket	LOCATION	and Rhode-Island , is a matter of some speculation .

Colo -LSB- Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	with about 500 Men , rais 'd at the Instance of some Gentlemen from
Connecticut	LOCATION	, who agreed we should take a joint Command of the Troops , the next morning at 4 oClock we surpriz 'd the Garrison & took them prisoners , the particulars of which you have doubtless heard ー Some dispute arising between
Colo Allen	PERSON	& myself , prevented my Carrying my Orders into Execution untill the 16th .

		when being Joined by 50 Men of my own Regt & a small Schooner taken at Skeensborough which I immediately Armed , & Sailed for
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	in quest of the Sloop , the 17th being becalmed within ten leagues of St Johns I mann 'd out two small Batteaus with 35 men & after rowing all night , at 6 oClock next morning , landed at

St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, having previously taken on board such Stores & c. as were valuable .

		Providence remarkably smiled on us , as a few hours Delay would have ruined our Design , a party of 120 men with six pieces Cannon for the Sloop , being on their March from

Brass & Iron Mortars & Howitz	ORGANIZATION	, & am making all possible preparation , for transporting all the Cannon here , and as many as can be spared at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, to Fort George ー I must beg leave to observe Gentlemen , that the report of
Ticonderoga	PERSON	's being abandoned , has thrown the Inhabitants here into the greatest Consternation , there is about five hundred families to the Northward of
Ticonderoga	PERSON	, who if it is evacuated will be left at the mercy of the
Kings Troops & Indians	ORGANIZATION	, & who have part of them joined the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, & can not now remain neuter , to whom a remove would be intire Ruin , as they have large Families , & no Dependance , but a promising Crop on the Ground .

		I need not add to this Gentlemen , that
Ticonderoga	PERSON	is the Key of this extensive Country , & if abandon 'd leaves a very extensive Frontier Open to the Ravages of the Enemy , & to Continual Alarms , which will probably cost more than the Expence of repairing and Garrisoning it.ー I esteem 'd it my duty as a Servant of the public 's to give you the foregoing hints & hope the Exigence of the times will be a sufficient Apology for the liberty I have taken ー I have the Honour to be very respectfully Gentn -LSB- & c. -RSB-

Carlton	PERSON	and all the
Ministerial Party	ORGANIZATION	in eanada against them , and provided they should after all their good Service in behalf of their Country , be neglected and left expos 'd they will be of all men the most Consumately miserable .

		The South Promontary of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	and
Lake George	PERSON	as to a Southern Direction are near the same and if we should give up the Sov ` reignty of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	we may as well give up the whole , if the Kings Troops should be again in Possession of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	and Crown Point , and
Command the Lake	LOCATION	, the Indians and Canadians will be much more
Inclin	LOCATION	'd to Join with them , and make Incursions into the Heart of our Country , but as the Colonies are now in the possession and
Actual Command of the Lake	LOCATION	having taken the Armed Sloop from George the Third which was Cruising in the
Lake	LOCATION	, and also Seiz 'd a Schooner belonging to Major
Skeene	PERSON	at
South-Bay	LOCATION	and have armed and mann 'd them both for the protection of our Country and the Constitution and Civil Priviledges and Liberties thereof .

		By a
Council of War	ORGANIZATION	held on board the Sloop the 27th Inst it was agreed to advance to Point au fore with the Sloop and Schooner and a number of Armed Boats well mann 'd , and there make a Stand , and act on the defensive , and by all means
Command the Lake	LOCATION	, and defend the frontiers , and wait for the special directions of the
Honble Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and govern ourselves accordingly , we are now almost ready to sail to that station which is about six miles this side , Latitude forty-five Degrees North , a small force with the Armed Vessells will at present Command the
Lake	LOCATION	and Secure the frontiers , the Canadians -LRB- all Except the Nobless -RRB- and also the Indians appear at present to be very friendly to us , and it is my humble opinion that the more vigorous the Colonies push the war against the Kings Troops in
Canada	LOCATION	, the more friends we shall find in that Country .

		Provided I had but five hundred men with me at St
John	PERSON	's when we took the
Kings Sloop	ORGANIZATION	, I would have advanced to montreal .

		Nothing strengthens our friends in
Canada	LOCATION	equal to our Prosperity in taking the Sovereignty of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, and should the Colonies forthwith send an
Army	ORGANIZATION	of two or three thousand Men and
Attack Montreal	LOCATION	, we should have but little to fear from the Canadians or Indians and would easily make a Conquest of that Place and set up the
Standard of American Liberty	ORGANIZATION	in the Extensive Province of Quebec whose limits was Enlarg 'd purely to subvert the
Liberties of America	ORGANIZATION	, striking such a Blow would intimidate the Tory party in
Canada	LOCATION	, the same as the Commencement of the war at
Boston	LOCATION	intimidated the Tories in the Colonies , they are a set of Gentlemen that will not be Converted by Reason but are easily wrought upon by fear , Advancing an
Army	ORGANIZATION	into
Canada	LOCATION	will be agreeable to our friends , and it is bad policy to fear the Resentment of an Enemy , if we lie easy & in a
Supine State	LOCATION	, and Governor
Carlton	PERSON	exerts himself against us vigorously , as we know he will , and who by a Legal Constitution can oblige our Friends to assist him he will by slow Degrees Discourage our friends and Encourage our Enemies and form those that are at present Indifferent , into Combination against us , therefore the possible way to Circumvent him and the Scheme of the ministry is to Nervously push an
Army	ORGANIZATION	into
Canada	LOCATION	, but if the Wisdom of the Continent in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should view the propos 'd Invasion of the Kings Troops in
Canada	LOCATION	as premature or Impolitick nevertheless I Humbly Conceive when your Honours come to the Knowledge of the before mention 'd facts , You will at least Establish some advantageous Situation towards the Northerly part of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	as a
Frontier	ORGANIZATION	, instead of the
South Promontory of Lake George	LOCATION	, there are many advantages in forming the frontier , near the Country of the Enemy , as first , it will be in our power to ravage and make Inroads into the Heart of the Enemies Country , the same as they might easily do , were they in Possession and Command of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, this Advantage will be of the utmost Consequence , be it in the hands of which Party it will , tho ' it is now in our hands , to give it up to them would be fatal , the Interest of the Colonies but more particularly to those who were instrumental in the Atchievement of the supremacy of that
Lake	LOCATION	but secondly , Commanding the Northerly part of the
Lake	LOCATION	, puts it in our power to work our Policy with the Canadians & Indians , we have made Considerable proficiency this way already , sundry Indians have been to visit us , and have returned to their Tribes to use their Influence in our favr , we have sent
Capt Abraham Nimham	PERSON	a
Stockbridge	LOCATION	Indian as our Embassador of Peace to the several
Tribes of Indians	ORGANIZATION	in
Canada	LOCATION	, he was accompanied by Mr
Winthrop Hoit	PERSON	, who has been a Prisoner with the Indians and Understands their Tongue , I do not imagine provided we
Command Lake Champlain	LOCATION	there will be any need of a War with the Canadians or Indians , pray pardon me on Account of my lmpertinency or Inaccuracy in this Composition as it is but a rough Draught wrote in great Haste from Your Honours every faithful -LSB- & c. -RSB-

NEW YORK	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY 1 Gentlemen : St.
John	PERSON	's ,
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, May 30 , 1775 As liberty is the blessing , and ought to be the care of all men , I need no other apology for this letter , than to acquaint you I am an American , of
Newburyport	LOCATION	,
New England	LOCATION	.

		On my arrival here , the 19th instant , from the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, I was informed of the care you had taken with regard to the exportation of bread and flour to this Island ... the necessities of the people here for bread and flour are so great , that I doubt not you will have numbers of vessels on your coast , under various pretexts to get bread and flour to supply them .

		They are now at their wits end to find means to acquire the necessaries of life ; yet such is their inveterate enmity against the Americans , that they can not help breathing out their malice at every opportunity , where their interest is not immediately affected .

		Last Saturday -LSB- May 27 -RSB- a schooner arrived here , belonging to
Salem	LOCATION	, in
New England	LOCATION	, from a fishing voyage ; the merchants immediately sent the crier through the Town , to notify a meeting at seven that evening , which was adjourned to Sunday , to consult on the matter .

		It seems they were in hopes to get some hold of her from some Acts of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	relative to the regulation of the fishery in this Island , but finding their expectations fail them , that they could not get her seized , nor prevent an entry , they mustered their forces , seized upon and sent her to Sea ; and what is mre surprising to me is -LRB- if I am rightly informed -RRB- that upon a promise of indemnification , they obtained an order from the Judge of the Admiralty for this extraordinary procedure , and that after her being admitted to a legal entry in the Custom-House .

ANDREW BARKLEY	PERSON	, R.N. , TO VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LRB- Copy -RRB-
Scarborough	ORGANIZATION	,
Piscataqua	PERSON	30th May 1775 Sir I received your Letter of the 25th Inst and likewise your Order with the two restraining Bills and Orders to stop and send to
Boston	LOCATION	all Vessels loaded with Provisions ; In my last I acquainted You of my giving
Lieut Mowat	PERSON	Orders to proceed to
Halifax	LOCATION	, the Wind continuing Easterly , made it impossible for him to get out of the
Harbour	LOCATION	, on the 23d he sent me a Copy of your Order , which he had received by Mr
Tyng	PERSON	in a small Sloop from
Boston	LOCATION	desiring he might remain at
Falmouth	LOCATION	, till further Orders , in consequence of which , I ordered him there as soon as he could get ready , which took up some time , as he was in want of Provisions .

		Yesterday two Sloops arrived here from
Long Island	LOCATION	, loaded with Corn , Flour , Pork , and Bread , which I have stopt and sent round to
Boston	LOCATION	agreeable to your Orders .

		The Stopping of these Vessels have been the cause of great Commotions in the Town of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, A
Committee	ORGANIZATION	applied to the Governor to have them discharged by either writing to me or coming down himself , accordingly he came Onboard here Yesterday in the afternoon he ask 'd me whether I could consistent with my Orders allow those Vessels to go to
Town	ORGANIZATION	and unload , I told him , I could not and shewed him your Orders to me , he said it might be of fatal consequences to many of the King 's Subjects ー I told him I could not help that , I must do my duty , he then delivered me a Paper a Copy of which I herewith transmit to You , 2 I have just been inform 'd there is a large body of People , come into
Portsmouth	LOCATION	from the Country , The Collector of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	and two or three other Friends to Government have taken shelter Onboard the
Scarborough	PERSON	, wether the Governor means to come onboard I can not as yet inform You , for when he came onboard Yesterday he was oblige to promise the people of the Town that he would return again so that he has not the least power or authority there ; They threaten much for two or three thousand people to come down and destroy the
Scarboroh	ORGANIZATION	; If they should have the madness to attempt any thing of that kind You may be assured the King 's Ship will be defended ; it was a very lucky Circumstance of my dismantling the Fort for they might very easily have come in and taken possession of it .

		There was a battery about a Mile and half from where I lay of eight twenty four Pounders , there are no Carriages to them , I heard they intended to move them upon an eminence in order to fire upon the Scarboroh Upon my hearing of their intentions , I ordered the Gunner to go onshore and spike them up , which has render 'd them useless for the present .

		I send these two Vessels round under the protection of the Canceaux , for if I had sent them singly by themselves , there were Arm 'd Boats all ready to pursue them and likewise expresses have been sent to
Newbury	LOCATION	and
Cape Ann	PERSON	to fit out Vessels to intercept them , as therefore it is morally impossible for me to send any Vessels that may be stop ' t with Provisions round to
Boston	LOCATION	without having an Armed Vessel to accompany them there otherwise they will be seized and the people in them very ill treated , if not put to death .

		I do n't know any other Scheme , that will have a great effect in bringing the People of this Province to a due sense of the Duty that they owe to the Mother Country than that of stopping their Provisions , I therefore think it an Object worthy of Attention .

		I am very much obliged to You for your polite Approbation of my Conduct since I have been in this Port , You may be assured that nothing shall be wanting on my part in doing every thing in my power for the good of His Majesty 's Service and the protection of his Servants .

		Near this house there was an outhouse where there were several

		MESHECH
WEARE	ORGANIZATION	TO THE PRESIDENT , PROVINCIAL CONGRESS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ,
EXETER	ORGANIZATION	1 Gentlemen : May 31 , 1775 As you have now under your consideration the important affair of raising Troops and appointing them to proper stations , as well for the safety and defense of this Province , as for promoting the common cause at this critical and alarming season , we doubt not but you will kindly receive intimations from any number of persons of things which appear to them of great importance ; we therefore beg leave to represent , from frequent alarms we have had , and from authentick advice from General -LSB-
Artemus -RSB- Ward	PERSON	, that a number of armed cutters are sailed from
Boston	LOCATION	, for what design is unknown .

		We apprehend it to be absolutely necessary that a proper proportion of the Troops to be raised in this Province be immediately assigned for the defence of our sea coast ; and permit us to suggest , that if a proper number of Troops for this purpose were ordered to be raised in the Towns near the sea-coasts , it would greatly facilitate the raising the men immediately , and be a great help for procuring immediate supplies , and we can conceive will be must more service to the common cause than sending our men elsewhere .

		It will also be a great discouragement to men enlisting to be sent to a distance , at the same time that they leave their friends and substance exposed by their absence , when they themselves might be more advantageously employed for there defence .

		We therefore pray that a proper quota of men may be assigned , and Officers for enlisting them , for this service , as soon as may be , which we submit to your wisdom and determination .

Barnstable	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	-RSB- May 31 , 1775 .

		I ,
Elisha Nye	PERSON	, Inholder Living on one of the
Elizabeth Islands	LOCATION	, Commonly Called Naushan , and near to
Tarpalan Cove	LOCATION	,
Testafieth	PERSON	and saith , that some
Time	ORGANIZATION	about the 5th of May , the Sloop of War called the Faulkland -LSB- Falcon -RSB- , Command 'd by Capt. -LSB-
John -RSB- Linzey	PERSON	, came into the Cove , and as soon as the Vessel had come to Anchor , the Captain came on Shore with his Boat 's Crew , all Armed , and came to the
House	ORGANIZATION	and
Said	PERSON	unto the Deponent `` you need not be Scard ; '' upon which he told him it was Enough to Scare any Body to see so many Men come on Shore Armed ; And the Women are all Fled and to where he knew not ; upon which
Capt Linzey	PERSON	told Him to call them in , for he did not mean to hurt any Body ー upon which Promise , I & my Family were Satisfyed ; Soon after that , the Captain asked to walk with him ; which he Comply 'd with ; and in the Course of the walk , he demanded to know what Stock I had , and Added to tell him Right , for if he did not , he would take all that he met ; upon which I gave him the Account .

		Then the Captain told me , the Deponent , if I sold any one of them he would take the Remainder by force ; upon which I told him , if he were here when they were fit for market he might have them , paying the Price I used to have .

		Soon after , he went to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and Return 'd back in a few Days ; after which , he used to pass & Repass the
Island	LOCATION	allmost every day , mostly in Company with the Doctor of the Ship , leaving down the fences Repeatedly , which let the Cattle often mix together , which I told the Doctor was a great Damage .

		the Doctor 's Answer was , `` then you may put it up yourselves for I will not , '' and often talked in an Abusive Insulting manner that he , the Doctor , would soon take what he wanted without any pay ー On the 26th Instant a Sloop came into the Cove , with about Twenty Passengers , Men , Women , & Children in great Distress for Provisions , and made application to me for Supplyes .


Capt Linzey	PERSON	knowing that , -LRB- his Boat having boarded her -RRB- sent his Boat on Shore , and forbid my letting them have any , Than I advised them to apply to
Capt Linzey	PERSON	, and see if they could not prevail upon him to let them have some ; accordingly they went ; Afterwards the Captain of the Sloop told me , that he absolutely Refused them , and said `` Damn the Dog that would let them have any ; and if they were not gone immediately , he would Sink them .

		-LSB- '' -RSB- upon which , they set sail Immediately without any Supplyes ー And further , the Deponent Declareth , that the Doctor came on shore , and said that the Captain 's Orders were , that I should go with him , the said Doctor and Destroy all the Boats belonging to the Island .

		I told him I could not go upon such Business as that ; he said he would send me on board the Ship if I did not go ; upon which I found I must Comply , and Accordingly went with him , and saw him , the Doctor , Stave three Boats .

		ー On the 29th , about Eight o'Clock in the Evening Lo , the said Doctor came on Shore , and told me he had come for my Sheep , upon which , I told him they were out in the Pasture and I could not get them into the pen it being Dark , but would fetch them in as Early in the Morning as he pleased ー the Answer from the Doctor was , `` Damn you !

		what did you turn them out for ? ''

		ー the Reason , I told him , was , that they had got out their own Sheep , and did not say any thing more about when they should want mine , and I thought it best the Sheep should be let out to feed ; upon which , the said
Doctr	PERSON	said to me , `` Damn you !

		go on Board the Ship and I 'll see what they were turnd out for . ''

		ー I told him I would not , but would go and try to get the Sheep up : he said `` Well , Damn you !

		make haste '' !

		and Swang his Sword over my head , ー but upon Trial I found it so Dark I could not get them in ; but , on my Return , was Inform 'd that he , the Doctor had sent onboard for more help to Carry me & my Brother on board the Ship ; upon which , with the Abuses & threats I had Received before , I thought it Time to make my Escape , which I did , to the main land and begged the Assistance of the People , who Readily came to my Assistance .

		ー When I Return 'd , which was about three o'Clock in the Morning , Some of my Family told me , they had been on shore , armed , and taken all my Calves , being Seven in Number ; two of the poorest & Smalest , they sent on shore in the Morning , the Others , with four Sheep they had some days before ; they carried them off without paying any thing for them .

		ー I do further Declare the Abuses and threats I Received from
Capt Linzey	PERSON	& the Doctor were the Occasion of my Moving off the
Island	LOCATION	, leaving my Interest , and I Declare that I never Refused
Capt Linzey	PERSON	or any other person Belonging to any ship of war , Entertainment in my
House	ORGANIZATION	or Supply of Provisions that I had on my farm that I could Spare and I further Declare that on the night of the 29th instant afforesaid -LSB- the -RSB- Doctor -LRB- as my wife Informs me -RRB- Came on Shore and Demanded my gun with his Sword in hand which she Delivered to him and I have not Seen it Since tho the only weapon of Defence that I had on the Island : the value of the Sheep Calves and Gun which they took frame me and the use of my Horse and well are as follows viz :

		STEPHEN NYE TO COLONEL
NATHANIEL FREEMAN	PERSON	1 Sir
Sandwich	PERSON	-LSB- Mass. -RSB- May 31st , 1775 I would give you a relation of Capn , -LSB-
John -RSB- Linsey	PERSON	, proceeding at the
Islands	LOCATION	since your going from here .

		On Sunday -LSB- May 28 -RSB- he recd a reinforcement by a Schooner from
Boston	LOCATION	, & proceeded from thence to the
West End of the Island	LOCATION	where they took off about Two Hundred Sheep ; chiefly from
Tuckers Island	LOCATION	which belonged to
John Wing	PERSON	from there they came down to the cove & ordered the Sheep there to be yarded which was accordingly done , but it being near Night they concluded to leave them in the Yard until morning .

		They really insulted abused & threatned the People for their backwardness in assisting them .

		In the Night word was brought off to
Falmouth	LOCATION	of the above proceedings -LRB- by
-LSB- Elisha -RSB- Nye	PERSON	who immediately went back to take care of his Family -RRB- on which a Number of men well equipt immediately went on the
Island	LOCATION	; before there arrival at the cove the Sheep were turned out of the Yard into the Woods .

		The People from the Ship had been on Shore & on finding the Sheep were gone were stil more enraged & took all the arms they could find , 6 Calves , & the Hoggs and carried them off .

		When the People from
Falmouth	LOCATION	got to the cove -LRB- which was before Day -RRB- they Placed themselves in the Bushes & lay undiscovered .

		In the morning the Boat came on Shore with the Doctor
Boatswain	PERSON	& c ; whom they might have taken had they not expected the Capn .

		ashore soon , however the Boat soon went back without going to the
House	ORGANIZATION	& both Vessels immediately weighed Anchor & went Dow : n to Homes ' Hole where they lay last Night at Anchor .

		Capn -LSB-
Barachiah -RSB- Bassett	PERSON	is now on the
Island	LOCATION	with about 50 Men , & will Tarry to Guard the Stock until we have the advice of the congress what method is best to take .

		By the best account there is not less than Four Thousand Sheep & between Two & three Hundred Homed cattle & a Number of Horses in the
Island of Naushaun & Perhaps	ORGANIZATION	nigh as many on the other Islands .

		It is generally Judged That Fifty or
Sixty Men Placed	ORGANIZATION	on the
Island	LOCATION	at Tarpaulin Cove would Guard the above Stock .

		It is certainly impracticable to bring it off & it must most certainly either be destroyed where it is or fall into the Hands of our Enemies .

		Which is best the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	must Judge .

		Their Determination we should be Glad of as soon as Possible for we fear the men now there will be impatient to come off unless they are put under Pay .


Capn Bassett	PERSON	is perhaps the best officer that can be placed there His Courage & Conduct have been heretofore well approved , & he is moreover well acquainted with the Ground on the
Island	LOCATION	which must certainly be of great advantage .

		There went a Number of men from This Town Some of whom are -LRB- we conclude now on the Island -RRB- We hope the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will let us have there advice & Determination as Soon as Possible and Pray that in all their Determinations they will be Councelled by the Supream Councellor & are Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-

-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	, dated Crown Point , 23 May , 1775 , was laid before the

		This letter being taken into consideration , Resolved , That the Governor of

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO
GEORGE WILLIAM	PERSON	FAIRFAX 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, May 31 , 1775 .

		Before this Letter can reach you , you must , undoubtedly , have received an Account of the engagement in the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	between the Ministerial Troops -LRB- for we do not , nor can not yet prevail upon ourselves to call them the King 's Troops -RRB- and the Provincials of that Government ... General
Gage	PERSON	acknowledges , that the detachment under Lieutenant Colonel
Smith	PERSON	was sent out to destroy private property ; or , in other Words , to destroy a Magazine which self preservation obliged the Inhabitants to establish .

		And he also confesses , in effect at least , that his Men made a very precipitate retreat from
Concord	ORGANIZATION	, notwithstanding the reinforcement under Lord
Piercy	PERSON	, the last of which may serve to convince Lord
Sandwich	PERSON	-LRB- and others of the same sentiment -RRB- that the Americans will fight for their Liberties and property , however pusilanimous , in his Lordship 's Eye , they may appear in other respects .

		From the best Accounts I have been able to collect of that affair ; indeed from every one , I believe the fact , stripped of all colouring , to be plainly this , that if the retreat had not been as precipitate as it was -LRB- and God knows it could not well have been more so -RRB- the Ministerial Troops must have surrendered , or been totally cut off : For they had not arrived in
Charlestown	LOCATION	-LRB- under cover of their Ships -RRB- half an hour , before a powerful body of Men from
Marblehead	LOCATION	and
Salem	LOCATION	were at their heels , and must , if they had happened to have been up one hour sooner , inevitably intercepted their retreat to
Charlestown	LOCATION	.

		Unhappy it is though to reflect , that a Brother 's Sword has been sheathed in a Brother 's breast , and that , the once happy and peaceful plains of
America	LOCATION	are either to be drenched with Blood , or Inhabited by Slaves .

		Sad alternative !

		But can a virtuous Man hesitate in his choice ?

Boston	LOCATION	, whom they unmercifully fell upon and murdered in cool Blood , and without Provocation , as they marched through the Country , having no regard to Age , Sex , or Infirmity ; at the same time ravaging the Country , burning , destroying , and laying all waste wherever they came , until at length they were met by a few Companies of Provincials who then thinking themselves justified by all the Laws of God and Nations , took up Arms in the immediate Defence of their Lives , and by a manly Exertion of that brave Spirit which a good Cause never fails to inspire , they , though greatly their Inferiors as to Numbers , providentially put a Stop to their destructive Career , and forced them to retreat with Precipitation and much Loss , for near 20 Miles , to their fortified
City of Boston	ORGANIZATION	, which unhappy devoted Place the
Army	ORGANIZATION	now consider as their own Property , in open exclusion of the right Owners .

		ー From all which it manifestly appears that the British Ministry mean no longer to receive the peaceable Addresses of the much injured
People of America	ORGANIZATION	, on the Subject of their invaded Rights ; but are determined , since they will not voluntarily make a total Surrender of their Freedom and Constitution , to wrest it from them by the brutal Hand of Violence .

		The
People of America	ORGANIZATION	are therefore now driven to this fatal Extremity ー either they must tamely submit to Slavery , and agree for themselves and their Posterity forever , to work for and maintain , with the Sweat of their Brows , their proud Masters and Overseers , the ministerial Pensioners , Placemen , and Hirelings , of every Denomination whatever ; or they must resolve firmly and manfully to maintain those Rights , which God gave , and the Constitution warrants .

		The latter Resolution our Sister Colonies have unanimously adopted , and accordingly have now in the field not less , from the best Accounts we have received , than 25,000 Men , well disciplined , and equipt with a large Train of Artillery and every Kind of military Implement necessary for immediate Action .

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER DATED JUNE 1 , 1775 , FROM THE PROVINCIAL CAMP AT
CAMBRIDGE	LOCATION	'' 1 When our people were engaged in taking the stock , & c. from
Noddle	PERSON	's and
Hog-Islands	LOCATION	, the king 's troops made an attack upon them .

		On
Hog Island	LOCATION	, the combat began about 5 o'clock in the afternoon , and continued almost incessantly till midnight .

		The attack was made with cannon , swivels , and small arms , from an armed schooner , sloop , and eight or ten barges , upon our people , who had small arms only , but were very advantageously posted by Colonel -LSB-
Israel	LOCATION	-RSB-
Putnam	PERSON	who got to them just in season to station and command them properly .

		He placed them in a ditch , up to their waists in water , and covered by the bank , to their necks : The Schooner , sloop and boats full of men , came within 12 or 15 rods of them , and gave our people a fine opportunity to place their shot well .

		About midnight the fire ceased a little , and our people retreated to the mainland , where they were soon after joined by Capt. -LSB-
Thomas Waite	PERSON	-RSB- Foster with two field pieces , which were planted on the way of
Winnesimit	LOCATION	ferry .

		At day light the combat was renewed , ー as the schooner passed the ferry way , she was briskly attacked by our people , with the field pieces and small arms , which soon clearing her deck , she drifted on shore , where our people set fire to her , and she blew up , notwithstanding the utmost endeavours of the people in the boats , & c. to tow her off , and save her from destruction ー In this they exposed themselves much to our fire , and suffered greatly .

		When they found the schooner was lost , they with difficulty towed off the sloop , much disabled , and retired to their den ; and thus ended the combat , at about 7 o'clock in the morning .

		In the afternoon , -LRB- Sunday -RRB- our people got out of the wreck , 12 four pounders , 6 swivels , and every thing else that was valuable , without molestation ; they afterwards removed or destroyed from both the
Islands	LOCATION	, all the stock , & c. viz. about 5 or 600 sheep , 30 horses , about as many cattle , a large quantity of hay , and burned all the barns and houses .

		All this was done in sight , and as we may say , under the noses of the whole fleet and army at
Boston	LOCATION	, without molestation .

		ー The killed of the enemy -LRB- viz. .

		Gen.
-LSB- Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	's crew of enemies to the English constitution -RRB- they themselves allow to be more than 100 , besides wounded ; others , who have good opportunity to know , say , their killed and wounded , exceed 300 , and I believe they have suffered as much as in their precipitate flight from
Lexington	LOCATION	, on the memorable 19th of April .

		Our killed none !

		wounded , three !

		Heaven apparently , and most evidently fights for us ; covers our heads in the day of battle , and shields our people from the assaults of our common enemies .

Jonathan -RSB- Brown	PERSON	and Captain -LSB-
Elisha -RSB- Phelps	PERSON	, a copy of which has been sent to

		They highly approve of , and take great satisfaction in the acquisitions you have made at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	,
Crown Point	LOCATION	, on the
Lake	LOCATION	, & c .

		As to the state you are in respecting men , provisions , & c. we have advices from
Connecticut	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, that ample preparation is making , with the greatest dispatch , in those two Colonies , from whence you may depend on being seasonably supplied .

		They are sorry to meet with repeated requests from you , that some Gentleman be sent to succeed you in command ; they assure you , that they place the greatest confidence in your '' fidelity , knowledge , courage and good conduct , and they desire that you at present dismiss the thoughts of quitting your important command at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	,
Crown Point	LOCATION	,
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, & c. ; and you are hereby requested to continue your command over the forces raised by this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, posted at those several places , at least until the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	or
Connecticut	LOCATION	shall take on them the maintaining and commanding the same agreeable to an order of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		To Colonel
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	,
Ticonderoga	PERSON	P.S. .

		We have just received the intelligence by a Letter from Governour -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Trumbull	PERSON	, that the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	have ordered a thousand men to march immediately to re-enforce the
Army	ORGANIZATION	now at
Crown Point	LOCATION	,
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, & c. , as also five hundred pounds of powder , & c .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	further advise that in case your present necessity requires it , you make use of the one hundred and sixty Pounds you found on board the Sloop , for the service of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, you accounting for the same to this or some other
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, or
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	of this Colony ; and they hereby assure you that this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	will repay it whenever it shall be ordered by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and that you also complete the raising the number of four hundred men , in the pay of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, if you judge it necessary .

		To the
House of Assembly of Connecticut Gentlemen	ORGANIZATION	, We gratefully acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 27th ultimo .

		We fully concur in opinion with you , that maintaining a post at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	or Crown Point , is of the utmost importance ; therefore take particular satisfaction that you have on this subject so early and repeatedly expressed your minds to the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		By private intelligence of the 28th ultimo , sent to Captain
Joseph Trumbull	PERSON	, we are informed that the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	do not understand the resolve of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, concerning said fortresses , to extend so far as to wholly dismantle them , but so far only as to supply any fortification that may be built at the
south end of Lake George	LOCATION	; which resolve , in this sense of it , they are with dispatch executing .

		Therefore , in our present distressing situation , we have postponed sending further assistance to Captain
Arnold	PERSON	, especially since
New York	LOCATION	have not requested it .

		To the Hon.
William Williams	PERSON	, Speaker of the
House of Assembly of the Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the
Provincial Congress of New-Hampshire Gentlemen	ORGANIZATION	, We send you enclosed a copy of a letter from
Colonel Arnold	ORGANIZATION	, commander of the Troops at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	and Crown Point , together with a copy of a letter from the Speaker of the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	for the Colony of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, by which you will be acquainted with the present situation of those fortresses , and the measures necessary to be taken for securing and defending so valuable acquisitions .

		You will doubtless agree with us in sentiment , that it is a matter of the greatest importance that those places remain in our possession , in order to secure our frontiers from the depredations of our enemies , if they should attempt to attack it from that quarter , of which there appears to be great danger .

		It was the agreement of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, that four hundred men , and one hundred pounds in money , should be raised for the reduction of the place ; and it is our determination to contribute our full proportion toward securing the acquisition .

		By the letter from the Speaker of the
House of Representatives for Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	you will find that that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	have voted to send immediately to their assistance four companies , and five hundred pounds weight of powder , and we suppose that the troops are upon the march there .

		And we most earnestly request that you would contribute your endeavburs likewise for the speedy and effective security of the aforementioned places , which , considering the importance of the affair , and the ready disposition which you have discovered for the defence of the common cause , leaves us no room to doubt of your compliance therewith .

		J. SPARDING TO THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS OF NEW YORK 1 The Memorial of
John Sparding	PERSON	, living at
Ticonderoga Landing	LOCATION	, the north end of
Lake George	LOCATION	, June 1 , 1775 Humbly sheweth : That your Memorialist has , for upwards of six years past , been at a great expence in providing boats and carriages for the ease and convenience of persons traveling this way with their baggage and effects , over the lake and carrying place , at an easy rate ; likewise providing batteaus on
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, for the convenience of gentlemen and others traveling to
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The unhappy differences now subsisting between the Colonies and the Mother Country , have put a stop to any business your Memorialist was formerly engaged in .

		Your Memorialist has , ever since the tenth day of May , -LRB- the day on which the fort at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	was taken , -RRB- assisted with his boats , men , & c. in transporting the troops , with their baggage and provisions , over
Lake George	LOCATION	and the carrying place , upon no other security than a verbal agreement with Colonel
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	, for twenty shillings currency , per day , for a perryaugre capable of crossing the lake with seventy men , besides a quantity of provision , and a batteau for carrying expresses ; and when there was not a sufficient loading for the perryaugre , to have the privilege of conveying such private property as might offer , of which your Memorialist is at present deprived ; your Memorialist having likewise carted the greatest part of the baggage and provisions over the carrying place , to whole amount of which , to this day , is near seventeen Pounds .

		And the gentlemen appointed here have this day intimated to your Memorialist that his teams are not to be any more employed , they having brought teams over the lake for said service ; your Memorialist , there , trusting in the known justice and humanity of the gentlemen in
New York	LOCATION	, who scorn to let any individual suffer , which must inevitably be the case of your Memorialist , unless your goodness prevents it , by confirming the agreement made by
Colonel Arnold	ORGANIZATION	; your Memorialist therefore humbly hopes , as he had done his utmost endeavour for the good of the common cause , and is disabled at present from providing for his family , you will take the same into consideration .

		And your Memorialist will ever pray .

Congress	ORGANIZATION	, at
New York	LOCATION	, June 1st , 1775 .

		Gentlemen ー Agreeable to the minute of the Grand Congress , we -LRB- being unable as you know to garrison Ticonderoga , Crown Point , or
Fort George	LOCATION	, -RRB- made application to the eastern Colonies for their assistance .

		In our letter to Governor -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Trumbull	PERSON	, of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, we desire him to order troops on that service , and inform him that it is our intention that the commanding officer of the troops should be the commander of the forts by them garrisoned .

		We moreover requested him , to give orders to such officer to use great diligence to prevent any inroads into
Canady	PERSON	.

		This morning we have received his Honor 's and the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	's answer , of which we send you a copy .

		You will find that one thousand men are already on their way to the frontier country ; their commanding officer is
Colo.	LOCATION	-LSB-
Benjamin -RSB- Hinman	PERSON	, wherefore we beg you will inform all persons in that part of the country of his appointment .

		We have at present no powder in this city , nor can we possibly tell you when we shall have any .

		The reason of this uncertainty is , that the British
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	have taken measures to prevent supplies of powder from coming to
America	LOCATION	, from any part of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		But you will easily see that though such attempts may delay , they can not prevent us from getting some .

		Should the Indians again mention their uneasiness on the subject of powder , it will , as we conceive , be proper to mention to them the endeavours of
Great Britain	LOCATION	to hinder both them and us from obtaining any .

		We have received your despatches of the 26th ulto. , and already forwarded copies to the
Grand Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are , Gentlemen , -LSB- & c. -RSB- To Doctr .

		I shall therefore fit out the Schooner that has been sent here by Genl -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, and arm her in such a Manner as will secure Her from all Insults .

TRAUGOTT BAGGE	PERSON	'S NARRATIVE OF EVENTS IN
NORTH CAROLINA	LOCATION	PRIOR TO GOVERNOR
JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	'S DEPARTURE FROM NEWBERN ON JUNE 1 , 1775 1 With the beginning of 1775 war began in earnest , and first in the northern Colonies .


Great Britain	LOCATION	declared certain American ports closed .

		All the Colonies resented this .

		In many harbors no British ships were allowed to enter ; in others they were permitted to come in and take a load of American products back to
England	LOCATION	, but were obliged to throw the cargoes from
England	LOCATION	overboard , and under no pretext were allowed to land them , ー for instance in March an English ship reached
Charlestown	LOCATION	, and its cargo of salt , potatoes and brick was thrown into the water , not by a mob but by the sailors , to make room for the return load of rice .

		This wanton waste of salt cost the colonists dearly enough , for during the war many were for a long time without salt , and had to substitute hickory ash , which made them first hoarse and then speechless ; others paid twelve to fifteen times as much for salt as before the war , and then had to be content with a very bad quality .

		The situation was somewhat helped by the salt works which were built on the seacoast in all the Colonies , those in
North Carolina	LOCATION	being not inconsiderable .

		In Feb. 1775 , our stores 2 secured its last regular shipment of wares from
Charlestown	LOCATION	, though already then many things were scarce and increasing in price .

		At about the same time the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	called by Governor
Josiah Martin	PERSON	met in
New Bern	LOCATION	, 3 the last to be held under royal authority .

		They had not been in session long when they entirely broke with the Governor , refused obedience to him and to the King , and resolved that for the rest of their session they would not be an Assembly under the Crown but a Convention to consider and provide for the best interests of

		NEW HAMPSHIRE GAZETTE , FRIDAY , JUNE 2 , 1775
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, June 2 .

		Last Tuesday -LSB- 30 ; May -RSB- about 30 or 40 Men from on Board the Scarborough Man of War , now in this
Harbour	PERSON	, came on Shore at
Fort William	LOCATION	and
Mary	PERSON	, and have tore down great Part of the Breast Work of said Fort , and did other damage .

		The Day before this Attempt , the
Scarborough	PERSON	took two Provision Vessels , loaded with Corn , Pork ,
Flower	PERSON	, Rye , & c. coming in from
Long-Island	LOCATION	; which were for the Relief of this Place ; as the inhabitants are in great Want of Provisions ; and notwithstanding the most prudent Application of the principal Gentlemen of this Town , the Captain refused to release them .

		O shocking situation .

		Upon this Refusal it was apprehended the most violent Outrages and Tumults of the People would immediately follow this Detention of their Provisions , the Consequences of which would be most probably very fatal to his Majesty 's Subjects , by bringing into the most imminent Danger , the Lives and Properties of his said subjects , which ought by all Means to be prevented if possible .

		Upon this unwarrantable Transaction , the Inhabitants of this and the Neighbouring Towns , were greatly alarmed ; and the next Morning between 5 and 600 Men , in arms , went down to the Battery called
Jerry	PERSON	's Point , and brought off Eight Cannon , 24 and 32
Pounders	ORGANIZATION	, being the whole that were there , weighing 4,800 pounds each , and brought them up to this Town .

		While they were taking off the above
Cannon	LOCATION	, the
Canceaux	LOCATION	, with a Tender , set sail with the two Provision Vessels for
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The next day the Town was full of Men from the Country in Arms .

		This uncommon Exertion of arbitrary Power immediately alarmed the Inhabitants , and the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	having met , a Memorial was , by their Approbation presented to the Governor and Council , who took every prudent Method in their Power to pacify the People , and to obtain a Release of the Captures .

		His Excellency repaired on board the
Scarborough	PERSON	, and informed the Captain that the Provisions were the Property of some of the Inhabitants , who had before contracted for the same , but the only Answer he could obtain was `` that Admiral
Graves	PERSON	and the General had forwarded Orders to take every provision vessel that should be met with , on every Station , and to send them forthwith to
Boston	LOCATION	for the Supply of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Captain
Barclay	PERSON	, the Commander of the
Scarborough	PERSON	, informed two of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	at Fort
William	PERSON	and
Mary	PERSON	, that his Orders were such that he must even take all Vessels with Salt or Molasses , they being a Species of Provision , and send them to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Sir The Select Men and Freeholders of this Town have this Morning represented to me that the Inhabitants are extremely distress 'd by sundry of their Fishermen being impress 'd Onboard his
Majesty 's Ship Scarborough	ORGANIZATION	under your Command whereby the sustenance of the People is greatly reduced .

		These Gentlemen on behalf of the Town , declare their universal disapprobation of the firing On your Boat , and that the Act is held in great detestation by them ー That they are desirous to have the Perpetrators , when discovered brought to condign Punishment ; They further declare that no obstruction is meant or in any degree intended towards the free passing and repassing of your Boats , which they consider as safely to be done , and will most earnestly and sincerely exert themselves to secure , confidently relying that there will be no danger therein .

		Theyalso express an ardent desire that the admission of Provision Vessels into this Port for the necessary Supply of this and the adjacent Towns , now in great want , might enable them to afford the usual Supply of fresh Provisions to his Majesty 's Ships in this
Harbour	PERSON	.

		These things being by them solemnly and seriously resolved , I beg leave to represent to You that a dismission of the Fisherman aforesaid may have a happy tendency towards a restoration of harmony and be a very powerful Evidence that his Majesty 's Servants are ever ready and disposed to lead by Acts of kindness to the re-establishment of Law and Peace among his Subjects , notwithstanding any errors of Individuals might justify the exertion of their power ; In this view I hope it may be Gonsistent with your duty to comply with the united desire of this People in the case aforementioned , which I verily believe will have a happy Effect on the Minds of the People in general , and be useful therein to the

Council of New Hampshire	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is an absolute necessity for cutting off all Supplies of Provisions from the Rebels , it is the only way we can distress them at present .

		The discretionary Power lodged with you of permitting Supplies sufficient for the peaceable Inhabitants of the Town of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	will I hope convince the refactory People that proceeding in Hostilities with you will not only totally deprive them of Provisions but of every Indulgence and Protection a dutiful and quiet behaviour would certainly ensure to them .

		I would not have you begin a war upon any Account , but if you are attacked you must defend the Kings Ships and do your utmost to destroy the Enemy , Pirate or Rebel .

		You will naturally be upon your Guard , and if the Rebels actually bring Cannon against you which can not be seized or dismounted , and it becomes no longer safe to remain in the
River	LOCATION	, you must then leave it and by cruizing in the Neighbourhood endeavour to execute the several Orders you are under until you can receive my further Directions .

		Send the
Canceaux	LOCATION	to

Rome	LOCATION	at first promised to deliver it up , but Capt.

Marines	ORGANIZATION	retired on board .

ALEXANDER INNES	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 My Lord ,
Charles Town	PERSON	, June 3 , 1775 I did myself the Honor of writing to Your Lordship by the Packet Boat the Le Despencer about the middle of last month ; 2 and a safe opportunity by a private hand this day offering , I beg leave to acquaint Your Lordship that the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	met last Thursday the 1st instant , passed their Tax Bill , which they had ready prepared , and without sending it to the Council , or using any other ceremony ; ordered Certificates to be issued for the amount of it , about 140,000 # currency .

		They had just finished this business when the Lieutenant Governor farther adjourned them to the 19th instant , and then returned to the Country , from whence he had come the night before .

		By a Vessel from
New York	LOCATION	that arrived here the 25th of last month , Mr.
Bull	PERSON	received a letter from General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	with an Account of the Action of the 19th of April ; it was not published till this afternoon , when it appeared in the News paper I enclose , and Comments upon it in the same Column , so alert , and well informed are our people here .

		The Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	met also on the 1st , and continue sitting : they have shut their doors against all but their own members , to whom they have strongly recommended strict Secrecy , but it is well known that the Objects of their present deliberation is framing a Test and
Association	ORGANIZATION	; raising a large body of Troops , and throwing off the Mask at once , and taking the Government into their own hands , which in fact they have almost done already .

		The Opulent and Sensible wish to avoid such desperate measures till they hear from the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	and have their Sanction ; but they are powerfully opposed by a numerous body of the Low and Ignorant , led by a few desperate Incendarys , who have nothing to lose , and some hot headed Young Men of fortune whom it will be difficult to restrain .

		The Governor is expected every hour , and although he can do very little , yet I hope his presence with the King 's ship under his Command may afford some countenance to the King 's friends , and will I know embarrass the other party , who have at present a clear field : on this Account I presume His Lordship will detain the Scorpion , and never quit his Government till the last extremity .

		I have had the strongest inclination for this fortnight past to give General
Gage	PERSON	an Account of the State of this Province , but it was a liberty I could not presume to take , though my warm Zeal for the service of my
Royal Master	ORGANIZATION	strongly promoted me .

		Two Frigates My Lord in this
Harbour	PERSON	would have been -LRB- and still would be -RRB- the means of preventing much mischief , and -LSB- would -RSB- have been such a check on the Violent party here , that they never could have gone the lengths they have already done : The Tamer Sloop lies some miles below the Town , but Captain
-LSB- Edward -RSB- Thornbrough	PERSON	, a very Old , Good Officer , has been confined to his Bed these two months and as the Lieutenant Governor is constantly at his country home waiting with anxious impatience for the Arrival of Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	, was it in the Captain 's power to be of use no proper requisition can be made him .

		As we are in such a State here that it is not proper to write but by very safe hands , I shall take the opportunity of again writing Your Lordship by Captain
Barbot	PERSON	,
Commissary of Stores	ORGANIZATION	in
West Florida	LOCATION	, who is now here on his way to
England	LOCATION	, and who may be able to acquaint Your Lordship with many particulars relative to this place .

		I have the Honor to be with the most perfect Respect My Lord -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		1 Capt. -- , -LRB- who on his passage to New-York from this place with a load of spars , was lately seized by Admiral

		He says he was at the wharf at

		He says the sloop near
Winnisimmit	LOCATION	, that had the first brush , cut or slipped her cables , and came and fastened to his stem : He was shocked to see the blood running out of the scuppers ; there was a number of dead and wounded lying on the deck , but the survivors did not care to tell how many .

		The
Diana	PERSON	schooner next engaged , and the master of her told Capt. -- , that guns never were better served than ours were , that not a shot missed him .

		I have not time to write you all he says .

		One man was carried on board for dead , but next morning came too , and had not the least wound about him ; others were frightened almost to death , & c. and that there was an amazing difference in the looks and behaviour of the enemy after the battle , from what there was before ; before there was nothing but noise and confusion , afterwards all were still and quiet , insomuch that you could hardly per ceive that there was any fleet or army there .

		From the General down to the common soldier , they seemed to be in a great panic , were afraid to go to bed , for fear the yankees should kill them before morning .

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LRB- Copy -RRB-
Scarborough	ORGANIZATION	at
Piscataqua	LOCATION	June 5th 1775 Sir , I wrote to You the 1st June by Mr -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Fisher	PERSON	, in that I acquainted You , I was credibly inform 'd that the People intended to erect Batteries in order to drive the Ship out of the
Harbour	LOCATION	, and that they were throwing up Intrenchments at
Kittery	LOCATION	on the
Massachusetts Side	LOCATION	, upon my observing their Motions , I wrote a Letter to Colonel
Sparhawk	PERSON	and Mr
Chaunsey	PERSON	two of the principal Inhabitants of that place and acquainted them I observed that they were erecting some Works in that part , I supposed for a Battery of Guns in order to annoy the King 's Ship , In the King 's Name wam 'd them to desist in such treasonable proceedings , for they might be assured that the moment a Shot was fired either from Cannon or Musquetry on the Ship or Boats , or one Gun pointed from that Eminence I would instantly batter down the Town of
Kittery	LOCATION	and destroy all the Vessels and Craft belonging to that part and likewise make Prisoners of every Man I met with ; In the Afternoon I received their Answer acquainting me that an Express had arrived in their Town , acquainting them , there were eight Vessels sent from
Boston	LOCATION	to make an Attack some where , that the People were much alarmed and accordingly assembled on that
Hill	PERSON	, in order to watch the motions of the said Vessels ; if they should come into the Port ; they likewise acquainted me , there was not one single step taken in building or rebuilding any fortification , but that the same remain 'd in the State it had been in for upwards of twenty Years ; And that they had done every thing in their powers to pacify and calm the People , and that they were beginning to disperse and go home , and they hoped their conduct would be such , That I would not be obliged to Act in the manner I mentioned to them , that they would heartily rejoice , if they could but be any ways instrumental in hindering all kinds of lmprudencies taking place amongst them , but such was the extremity of the times , that it was impossible to restrain all , but at all times would do their utmost , to keep peace and good Orders and that they were retiring with their Families , to some place of quietness , if such a Place could be found ; seeing the Inhabitants of
Kittery	LOCATION	and
Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	removing from their dwelling Houses with all their effects and the number of Armed Men on both sides and likewise in the Town of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, made me imagine they had some intention of putting their threats into Execution in attacking the Ship and it was so universally believed onshore , that Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Cochran	PERSON	who commands
Fort William	LOCATION	and
Mary	PERSON	, removed his Family and all his Effects from there ; We lay under Arms all night about 3 o'Clock in the Morning as the Guard-boat was rowing guard ; about a Mile ahead of Us She was fired upon by about forty Men who lay concealed behind an old
House	ORGANIZATION	close by the
Waterside	LOCATION	where she went past , they shot one Man in the Arm and slightly wounded two others , the Officer and people returned their Fire , I immediately fired three or four Guns from the Ship upon those Rebels , but it being dark and they hid behind some Rocks , I believe the Shot did no Execution , I immediately acquainted Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	of this event , who in return acquainted me , in the Name of the Town that they were no ways concerned in this base and destructive Act , and that the whole town universally exclaimed and censured such a murderous Act and would do every thing in their power to bring the Perpetrators to Justice -LRB- which they never mean to perform -LSB- -RRB- -RSB- .

		I immediately seized upon all their Fishermen that I met with , which were about nine or ten , upon which a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	who act at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	wrote to me and said they were very ready to settle any manner of dispute that might be between me and the Town of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	; I sent them a Memorandum that I knew of no such People as those that stile themselves Committee Men , but if the
People of Portsmo	ORGANIZATION	: wanted to settle any matters with me , respecting the present interruption of the Communication between me and , the Town , it must come thro ' Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	to me , That I would have wrote to
Govr Wentworth	PERSON	, but he informed me , that all Communication between him and the
Scarborough	PERSON	was cut off .

		The next morning the Selectmen of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	waited on me with a Letter from Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	A Copy of which I herewith send You .

		I acquainted these Men that when I was convinced there was peace and good Order in the Town of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	and if there was no obstruction in his Majs Ship being supplied will all Necessaries that She might want nor her Boats molested in passing or repassing to the Town from the Ship , That I would discharge them , and would give His Majesty 's peaceable Subjects in the Town of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, every Indulgence I could consistent with my duty , they assured me in the Name of the Town that I should be supplied as usual and the intercourse noways interrupted , upon which I discharged the Men , I hope it will meet with your Approbation ; I hope we shall have peace and quietness now for a little while ; as the People are returning back with their effects .

		The Collector and some other People who had taken shelter Onboard of the
Scarborough	PERSON	, from the Selectmens assurance of peace in the Town , are gone back .

		I dont believe it will be very long before they will be here again .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	1 Sir ,
Preston Boston	PERSON	7 June 1775 The Rebels pursuing their avowed design of cutting off possible Supply to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and of destroying what they can not carry away , burnt a great deal of Hay on
Hog Island	LOCATION	the 27th of last month ; a few hours after they landed on
Noddles Island	LOCATION	not only to burn the Hay thereon bought for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, but also to set fire to a Store house , hired when the
Glasgow	LOCATION	was ashore , in which I had deposited two large Cargoes of Lumber ,
Board	ORGANIZATION	and Spars , until an Opportunity offered of sending part of each to
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		In the Store house was also many other Articles that the Store Schooner could not conveniently hold .

		The preservation of all these became of great Consequence , not altogether from their intrinsic Value , but from the almost impossibility of replacing them at this Juncture .

		On
Noddles Island	LOCATION	, besides the Hay and Stores just mentioned , were above 600 Sheep , several milch Cows and a Number of Horses ; the most part private property .

		It was absolutely requisite to prevent the destruction of the Stores , and if possible the Hay , Sheep & c : therefore upan observing the Rebels landed on
Noddles Island	LOCATION	, I ordered the
Diana	PERSON	to sail immediately between it and the Main , and get up as high as possible to prevent their Escape , and I also directed a party of Marines to be landed for the same purpose : there was no time to be lost , and assistance from the
Army	ORGANIZATION	could not immediately be had .

		The
Diana	PERSON	entered the River between three and four in the Afternoon at low water , and proceeded to
Hog Island	LOCATION	with some interruption from the Rebels on all Sides .

		The Number on Hog and
Noddles Islands	LOCATION	were computed at 700 men .

		Parties of each occasionally attacked the
Diana	PERSON	, but they were all obliged to quit
Noddles Island	LOCATION	without doing the intended Mischief .

		This effected , as I had ordered Lieut. -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Graves	PERSON	not to remain in the River upon the Turn of the Tide , he began to come away : It fell calm ; the Boats of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	were ordered to tow the
Diana	PERSON	: by the close of the Evening the whole Country was alarmed ; General -LSB-
Israel	LOCATION	-RSB-
Putnam	PERSON	had brought I am told full two thousand Men with two Field pieces from
Cambridge	LOCATION	, with which he lined the Shore and greatly annoyed the
Diana	PERSON	.

		The Marines from the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	were landed on the
Island	LOCATION	with two Pounders from the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	, and the General sent two pieces of Artillery ; but it was impossible , tho ' in sight of the Fleet , to give the schooner any other Assistance than by Boats to tow her out ; her slow progress by this means unavoidably exposed her to the Enemy ; the Calm continued , it grew almost dark , the fire of the Rebels increased , and between 11 and 12 at Night she unfortunately got aground upon the Ferry Ways at
Winnisimmet	LOCATION	, and the Tide ebbing fast it almost instantly became impossible to move her , although every means was tried to get her off ; about 3 in the Morning she fell over , so that they were obliged to quit her and go into the Britannia armed Sloop , who had been sent to their Assistance .

		In this Sloop they renewed the fight , which had continued with little intermission from 4 o'Clock ; but , as the Schooner was by this time dry , the Rebels set her on fire and entirely destroyed her .

		In the Somersets Boat two Men were killed and two wounded ; several were wounded in the Schooner and other Boats .

		I transmit the Sentence of a Court Martial held upon the Commander , Officers and Crew of the said Schooner on this occasion .

		The very honourable Acquittal of the Commander of the
Diana	PERSON	by the Court , I make no doubt will be satisfactory to their Lordships .

		Several of the Members saw part of the Action .

		The Situation of the Combatants afforded me also an opportunity of hearing their Discharges at each other and for some time of seeing the Battle .

		The concurrent Testimony of those immediately concerned , of the nearest Spectators , and indeed the general
Voice	ORGANIZATION	, authorize me to assure their Lordships of the perseverance and good Conduct of Lieut. Graves the Commander of the
Diana	PERSON	in this Action , which lasted nearly eleven hours .

		I beg you will also represent to their Lordships , that it being very warm Weather , the far greater part of the Officers and people were in their Shirts , that the necessity for quitting the Schooner was urgent , and that it was morally impossible to save a single Article ; with the loss of the
Kings Schooner	ORGANIZATION	therefore they lost every thing they possessed on Board her .

		I submit to their Consideration that as the Schooner was bravely defended to the last moment , against a very superior Enemy , the Officers and Crew should be indemnified for their Losses .

		It will operate as an Encouragement and be an Example to the whole Fleet to defend his Majesty 's Ships and Vessels to the last Extremity , even against great Superiority of Numbers ; and ought not to be drawn into precedent , except in extraordinary cases like this and the
Gaspee	PERSON	's at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, The Commander of which received very honorable Marks of their Lordships appreciation of his Conduct , and the Officers and Crew were I am told also severally recompenced .

CADWALLADER COLDEN	PERSON	, LIEUT. GOVERNOR OF
NEW YORK	LOCATION	, TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
New York	LOCATION	7th June 1775 His Majesty 's Ship
Asia	LOCATION	came into our
Harbour	LOCATION	about ten days since .

		In my letter of March 1st No 13 I informed your Lordship that I had suggested to Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	the propriety of sending one of the large Ships to this Place .

		He answered that I might expect the
Asia	LOCATION	here by the 1st of April .

		I am heartily sorry she was not , for I really think the Countenance of that Ship would have had a good effect by encouraging some and discouraging others ... In my letter to Your Lordship No 16 -LSB- May 3 , 1775 -RSB- I mentioned the very disagreeable & critical situation of the Few Troops who were quartered in the Barracks of this Place and that only by the interposition of the more prudent Inhabitants , they were suffered to remain in Peace .

		No Pains however were spared to debauch the men and induce them to desert .

		Large Rewards and certain Protection they were assured of ; which had such effect that the officers began at last to apprehend they were in danger of looseing the whole .

		In this situation General
-LSB- Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	wrote to Major -LSB-
Isaac -RSB- Hamilton	PERSON	, by the
Asia	LOCATION	, that he thought it would be a proper measure to put the Troops under his command on Board of that Ship , and desired him to consult with me upon it .

		As I was very sensible this small number of Troops could not be of any use in the Barracks , and were exposed to those very disagreeable circumstances I have already mentioned , I did not doubt of the propriety of the Measure proposed by Genl
Gage	PERSON	a difficulty however arose on account of the women and Children , who were too numerous to be taken on Board with the men , almost the whole that belong to the Regiment being in the
Barracks	ORGANIZATION	here with this detachment .

		This occasioned a delay of eight or ten days in which time several soldiers deserted .

		We at length thought of enchamping the Women and Children on what is called the
Governors Island	LOCATION	, till they could be otherwise taken care of , and yesterday was fixed for embarking the Troops on Board the
Asia	LOCATION	.

		The Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	had notice , that some people proposed to stop the embarkation upon which they published a hand Bill adviseing the People by no means to molest the Troops , or interrupt them in their design .

		They likewise appointed a number of their members to join the City Magistrates and assist them in preventing any interruption to the Troops .

		As soon as the Troops marched from the Barracks , several People began to harangue them , exhorting them to desert , and assuring them of sufficient Protection Two or three fellows had the hardiness to tum off with their arms , from the Ranks , and were immediately carried away by the People , when the Troops got upon the Deck -LSB- Dock -RSB- where they were to embark on board of Boats , the Carts following in the rear with the Baggage , were stoppd and in the Face of the Mayor , Aldermen ,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and
Committee	ORGANIZATION	men , turn 'd about by a few desperate fellows , carried to a Place in Town , where they opened the Baggage , and took out a number of spare arms and all the ammunition belonging to the Detachment .

		The Troops embarkd without their Baggage 1 .

		JOURNAL OF THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS OF NEW YORK 1 -LSB-
New York	LOCATION	-RSB- Die Mercurii 9 ho .

		A.M. , June 7 , 1775 Mr.
-LSB- Gouverneur -RSB- Morris	PERSON	, from the Committee for that purpose , reported a draught of a Letter to the New-York Delegates at the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, on the subject of erecting a Fortification at
King	ORGANIZATION	's Bridge .

		The same was read and approved of , and is in the words following : Gentlemen : In Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, New-York , June 7 , 1775 Upon receiving the resolutions of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	which relate to the fortifying
King 's Bridge	LOCATION	, & c. , we appointed Committees to view those places .

		Our Committee from
King 's Bridge	LOCATION	made a report the third instant , of which we send you a copy .

		We have only to add , that by reason of the easiness of approach , which will arise from the great irregularity of the ground on
Manhattan 's Island	LOCATION	, especially to the northward , no fortification can be so constructed as to be tenable for any length of time ; and even if such thing were practicable , yet if the enemy are superiour in the field , then , as they must necessarily command the rivers , such fortification might be reduced by famine , if not otherwise to be taken .

		It follows , therefore , that if the post is to be fortified , with a view to render it a magazine or place of arms , that no part of the island is properly adapted to that purpose .

		Considering it in the light of a post for preserving the communication between the city and the country , upon a supposition that the rivers are occupied by ships-of-war , then if the place marked A were strong and capable of sustaining a regular siege , still a body of forces on the island could as effectually cut off the communication in many other places .

		On the other hand , if the enemy should possess themselves of the post A , besides that it is commanded by the two heights marked B , particularly
Tippett	PERSON	's
Hill	PERSON	, yet it would by no means serve to cut off the communication , because it would be easy to cross
Harlem River	LOCATION	in boats , with a body of forces , in several places , where no vessel-of-war could lay without being exposed to fire from such very high grounds as to be quite out of reach of her artillery ; and also because that river is fordable in places which are covered from any fire which can be made from the said post .

		And not only would the enemy 's possession be ineffectual for their purposes , it would also bring on them certain destruction ; for that it would be very easy to cut off their retreat to the Town , and , from the great elevation of ground above the river , to prevent any relief which they would receive from vessels-of-war ; wherefore , if we have the superiority in the field , they would be with great ease driven from that post , or starved in it .

		This place , therefore -LRB- the only one which can secure the bridges , -RRB- being of little consequence to us , and of still less to them , we are of opinion that it would be very imprudent to fortify it at present , because the expense will be much greater than after we have troops embodied , who can perform much of the labour , and also for a reason mentioned in the report of our Committee .

		You will take notice , gentlemen , that we have no ammunition , nor any Engineer ー two most necessary implements of war , you will certainly acknowledge ; the first we hope for from the endeavours of our merchants , the last you will take some care to procure , if to be had amongst you .

		Be assured that we have the greatest willingness to obey the resolutions of the Grand
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; and if in their wisdom they shall think fit to overrule the reasons which we have offered , doubt not that we shall use our utmost efforts to comply with their requisitions .

		We are , gentlemen -LSB- & c. -RSB- To the
New York Delegates	ORGANIZATION	in
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ordered , That a copy of this Letter be engrossed , signed by the President , and , together with a copy of the Report therein mentioned , and a copy of a Draught or Plan therein mentioned , be transmitted by the first conveyance .

		The Report above mentioned is in the words following , to wit : We , your
Committee	ORGANIZATION	appointed to view the ground in the environs of
King 's Bridge	LOCATION	, do most humbly report : That in obedience to your commands we have examined the heights in that neighbourhood , taking such assistance as the shortness of the notice permitted us to procure , and are of opinion that a post -LRB- capable of containing three hundred men -RRB- erected on the high ground adjoining Mr.
Hyatt	PERSON	's house , marked A in the annexed map , will answer the purpose proposed by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	in their requisition , so far as the occupying that bridge can contribute to the keeping up a communication between the country and this city ; for we beg leave to observe , that an enemy may land and seize on several posts in this island capable of interrupting , though not totally cutting off that communication held up as a point of so much importance by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are farther of opinion that this work should be constructed by troops when embodied and ready to ー occupy it , your
Committee	ORGANIZATION	being humbly of opinion it would be the highest imprudence to erect a fortification before we have the means of defending it .

		By this mode of proceeding the expense will also be very much reduced .

		We believe that though there be no water immediately on the spot proposed for this post , yet means may be fallen upon to cover those who go to a well sunk in the adjoining low ground , near Mr.
Hyatt	PERSON	's house , especially as we conceive this post is not supposed to sustain any regular attack , or of many hours ' duration , without relief .

		We think fascines the cheapest and best materials to face this work , and that an abattis of fallen wood will contribute much to the security of the post .

		With respect to the particular form and dimensions , your Committee dare not venture -LRB- without the assistance of an Engineer -RRB- to recommend any particular plan to your consideration , and therefore pray your attention to provide a person _ of experience in this line of military science .

		All which is most humbly submitted .

		By order of the Committee
James Van Cortlandt	PERSON	, Chairman The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	appointed for that purpose , reported a draft of a Report of additional Artificers and Stores to be forwarded to
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	.

		The same was read and agreed to , and is in the words and figures following , to wit : The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	having considered the requisition on this Colony made by Colonel B -LSB- enedict -RSB- Arnold , commandant at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, for provisions and stores & c. , transmitted to this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by the
Committee of Albany	ORGANIZATION	, and at the same time compared it with the list of supplies already ordered to be sent , do report ; that the following additional stores & c. , ought to be provided and sent : 10 men of the train of artillery : 12 ship carpenters and caulkers : 2 gunsmiths : 2 blacksmiths : 2 masons : 100 hatchets : 20 broadaxes : 50 spades : 50 hoes : the iron work for 4 gins and blocks ; 8 falls for do , of 4 1/2 inch rope : 1 coil 2 1/2 inch rope , 1 coil 2 inch rope : 1 coil 1 1/2 inch rope , 100 fathoms each : 4 pieces ravens duck : 40 pounds sewing twine : 10 dozen of sail and bolt rope needles : 1 dozen palms : 2 seines , 30 fathom long , capt 12 feet , and arms 6 feet deep , of coarse twine , meshes 1 1/2 inch square : 2 dozen of nail hammers : 1 faggot of steel .

		As to the oxen , carts , & c. , mentioned in the said requisition , your Committee are of opinion that those can be procured in the neighbourhood of that post .

		Ordered , That a copy thereof be made and delivered to
Peter T. Curtenius	PERSON	, and that he be desired to obtain the said Artificers , Men , and Stores , and forward the same to
Albany	LOCATION	with all possible despatch .

James Warren	PERSON	used the letter in the
Massachusetts Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	sometime between June 12 , 1775 , when a committee appointed to consider a naval force reported , and June 20 , when the matter was ordered `` to subside for the present . ''


Warren	PERSON	wrote
Adams	PERSON	on July 11 , that he had seen the letter to
Gerry	PERSON	containing
Gadsden	LOCATION	's opinions , and had borrowed it in his vain effort to support the naval measure .

		As transit of letters between
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and
Watertown	LOCATION	consumed an average of ten days , the letter could not have been written later than June 7 to have been available to
Warren	PERSON	.


Adams	PERSON	wrote his wife ,
Abigail	PERSON	, on June 2 and June 6 , and to
Warren	PERSON	and to

Provencial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that the troops while they behaved peaceably should not be molested either in their barracks or in their embarkation , we had no reason to expect interruption , much less insult ; but notwithstanding the presence of the Mayor , Recorder , and other Magistrates , as well as several members of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, who attended us on our march , the carts on which our baggage was loaded , were forcibly carried off by a body of people , the trunks and packages in violation of all faith broke open , their contents Examined , and upwards of 100 stands of arms together with several of the absent officer 's fusils , are still detained from us , and this as we are credibly informed , by the advice of some of the Members of the
Provencial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, and which we are the more inclined to believe , from some of them personally assisting in stopping the carts ー The interruption of our baggage occasioned us to make a halt in the street , when some of the apparent leaders among the people harranged our Men , and publickly encouraged them to forfeit their allegiance to which they had solemnly sworn , and desert the service they had engaged in ー Had we been equally prone to Acts of violence , and which indeed we had sufficient provocation to justify us in , the consequences might have been fatal to many ; but upon assurances from the Magistrates that the Baggage should be restored to us , we chose rather to depend on these assurances than add to the confusion of the City .

		The private property of the officers has been restored to them , in the mutilated disorderly condition I have just mentioned , as well as the Regimental Cloathing but the arms and accoutrements are still in their possession , and I should deem myself very difficient in my duty , were I tacitly to pass over the high insult and outrage offered to his Majesty 's troops , or the detention of his property ; I have therefore taken the earliest opportunity of laying these circumstances before your Honor , and solliciting your Advice and assistance on the Occasion .

		I have the honor to be Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		ST.
GEORGE TUCKER	PERSON	TO
THOMAS JEFFERSON	PERSON	, A DELEGATE TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS FROM
VIRGINIA	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir
Williamsburg	LOCATION	June 8th : 1775 .

		I must apologize to you for the Liberty I take in addressing you as a Member of the
General Congress	ORGANIZATION	, but the Importance of the Occasion I hope will excuse it .

		I shall therefore without further prelude proceed to the Occasion of this Letter .

		The Island of
Bermuda	LOCATION	, by it 's detached Situation , by the Number of it 's Inhabitants , by its inconsiderable produce , and by the small progress made there in Manufactures , must be reduced to the most dreadful Calamities by the present Contest between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the Colonies , should both parties demand a Complyance with their respective Measures .

		Utterly destitute of the Means of obtaining Provisions for their Support , except from the Continent ; and altogether unable to procure Cloathing from any other Source than
Great Britain	LOCATION	, since the Island affords neither Materials , nor Manufacturers , it is altogether impossible for them to exist without the Assistance of both .

		Their Commerce with
Great Britain	LOCATION	, I apprehend does not amount to more than # 20,000 , Stg .

		per An : if so much .

		Their Remittances , having no produce of their own , are made either in Cash , Bills of Exchange , or Logwood and Mahogany which they procure at the
Bay of Honduras	LOCATION	; so that no Revenue arises to
Great Britain	LOCATION	from any Exports from thence .

		Their Commerce , therefore , is so trifling as to be utterly incapable of affecting the
Trade of Great Britain	LOCATION	in any Respect .

		Again , from
America	LOCATION	they are supplied with provisions , for their shipping , and , indeed , for the support of the whole Island for at least ten Months in the Year .

		These are procured , either in Exchange for Cash , or Salt , or else purchased by the hire of their Vessels , which have been Carriers for
America	LOCATION	and the
West Indies	LOCATION	from the first Settlement of the Island .

		The Inhabitants are a people , who , from their immediate Connection and frequent Intercourse with the Continent , have contracted an affection for this Country .

		They consider the Americans as Brethren , and their Souls are animated with the same generous Ardor for Liberty that prevails on the Continent ; they are most Zealous Friends to the
Cause of America	ORGANIZATION	, and would readily join with it , in any Measures to secure those inestimable privileges now contending for ; in short , they consider the Cause as their own , and with pleasure behold every step that has been taken in support of it .

		Their Conduct , on a former occasion , by refusing to admit the Stamps in 1765 , and obliging the Stamp Master to resign his office , I think must be considered as a proof of what I have here advanced .

		But so incapable are they of acting in Conjunction with
America	LOCATION	, on this Occasion , however ardently they might wish to do so , that a single Ship of War might cut off all Communication whatsoever with the Continent , and reduce the Island to the most horrid state of Distress , if once obnoxious to
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		It is from this apprehension that they have not declared their most cordial Concurrence in the Measures of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and adopted them for their own Government ; since such a step might involve above 12,000 .

		people in the most irretrievable Distress .

		Such are the Motives which have restrained their Conduct hitherto .

		By Letters from some of the principal Gentlemen of the
Island	LOCATION	I think myself authorised to make this Declaration of their Sentiments , and , further , to add , that if the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will agree to supply them with provisions , they will with Chearfulness accede to any Restrictions they may think proper to impose .

		They will enter into the most solemn Engagements that no Commodities shall be reshipped from thence to any other place which the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	may think proper to have no Commerce with .

		They will enter into an association against all sumptuary Articles , if it is demanded of them , and will agree to import nothing from
Great Britain	LOCATION	except the absolute Necessaries of Life .

		They will further engage to supply the Colonies with Salt from
Turk 's Island	LOCATION	,
Tortuga	PERSON	's , & c. in Exchange for those commodities they shall recieve from them .

		And , finally , will readily adopt any Measures which may be judged necessary for the
Benefit of America	ORGANIZATION	, and will strenuously oppose whatsoever may make against it 's Interest .

		If , therefore , the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will agree to supply them with provisions , I think I may venture to engage , that an
Association	ORGANIZATION	, agreeable to what I have above stated , if required , will be entered into by the first of September , the Day when all Commerce with the rest of the
British Dominions	ORGANIZATION	is to cease .

		2 Perhaps , Sir , such a Measure may be attended with mutual advantages to
Bermuda	LOCATION	and the Colonies .

		Of this I can not pretend to determine , but beg leave to submit the following Queries to your Consideration .

		Do any of the Acts of Trade and Navigation prohibit the reshipping and Exportation of any of the produce of the Colonies from those
British American Islands	LOCATION	into which they were imported , to those parts of
Europe	LOCATION	, or other foreign Markets to which they might be exported immediately from the Colonies ?

		If there is no such prohibition contained in any former Acts of parliament , does the restraining
Bill	PERSON	, by Construction , amount to such prohibition ?

		May not those Commodities which are permitted to be exported to the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, and other parts of
Europe	LOCATION	, except
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, be exported by the way of
Bermuda	LOCATION	, notwithstanding the restraining
Bill	PERSON	, if , upon their entering into proper Engagements , the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should think proper to continue their Exports to that Island .

		Would not such a Continuation of the Grain Trade be attended with the most happy and salutary Effects , and be the Means of enabling
America	LOCATION	to make a more lasting Resistance to parliamentary Measures ?

		I have ventured -LSB- to -RSB- throw together these few Hints , with a design of offering them to your Consideration as I understand you intend to join the American
Congress	ORGANIZATION	soon .

		And if any thing I have here said should be the Means of prevailing on you to offer your Interest with that august Body , in behalf of my wretched Country , I shall esteem it a peculiar Happiness of my Life to have taken this opportunity of subscribing myself , with the most unfeigned Esteem , Sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB- St.

Charleston	LOCATION	-RSB- 8th June 1775 p Capt Lessley You will be anxious to know our proceedings in Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	I shall inform you as fully as time will permit .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has sat daily from the first day of this Month ; so diligent have we been that have I thought my Self fortunate by an adjournment for two or three Hours after Sitting about five in one Spot Some times I have not been relieved in Seven & an half 2 ー I wish I could add an Account of good fruits from so much Industry .

		... We have ordered the Pilots not to board or bring in any Man of War or Transport Ship , What is to become of Lord Wm C -LSB- ampbell -RSB- & his Suite ?

		I argued our conduct would be ungrateful , inhuman & answer no other end but that of Shewing our ill temper ー but the order was confirmed ; His Lordship will certainly find a way into this
Harbour	LOCATION	without the aid of our pilotsー Qn ?

		whether the Militia Should receive him agreeable to an order from the Lieutt Governor , at his Landing ?

		ー much altercation ensued without conclusion on the point ー but if we agree to a Report now before us in which tis recommended that all the Militia Officers Should resign their Commissions , His Excellency will not have the Honour of Seing our Traind Bands as a first object.ー A Report that we Should immediately purchase & fit out as a Ship of War the
Marie Wilhelmina	PERSON	to mount about 50 Guns in order to keep out any of His Majesties Ships of War -LRB- & as Some whispers went to Seize & take the
Tamar	PERSON	now in port -RRB- & for the better defence of this
Harbour & Town	ORGANIZATION	was considered the 5th when the debates were apparantly exhausted & the Qn ?

		called for ー two or three Members rose & requested to know the opinion of the Chairman ー I declined Such interposition ー nevertheless a violent advocate rose & dropped such expressions as produced a confused clamour & dialouge Some what Like the inclosed account of it 3 ー when that Noise had Subsided in order to gratify the Members who had desired to know my Sentiments as well as to Speak them on so important a point &
Shew	PERSON	that I would not be intimidated I did Speak nearly in the words following the dialogue ー the Question was put & passed in the Negative by so great a Majority as all the difference between 11 Yeas & about 180 Nays ー in consequence of that disappointment a long train of Armed Schooners , Fortifications , & the intended Blockade of the Channels into the
Harbour	LOCATION	, all the effects of Fear & Zeal in a deleriam , was postponed & Laid aside , ー We had Some days ago prohibited the exportation of Corn & yesterday forbid the further Shipping of Rice ー all that remains in the Province is to be purchased & Stored for the public Service in different quarters of the Country upon a Supposition that no more than 3 or 4 Thousand Barrels are on hand but I am assured there are nearer Ten thousand ー another Scheme of groundless Fears in Some & Interested views in othersー 1 .

		COLONEL
ETHAN ALLEN	PERSON	TO THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS OF
MASSACHUSETTS	ORGANIZATION	1 Honorable Gentlemen , Crown Point , June 9 , 1775 I am informed by Colonel
-LSB- James -RSB- Easton	PERSON	that you are well satisfied with the economy and enterprising spirit of a number of the Sons of Liberty , who , animated with the glorious example of the brave action at
Concord	ORGANIZATION	, were inspired to make those acquisitions to the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	of which your Honours have received intelligence , viz : the sovereignty of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, and the fortresses thereon , with an armed sloop and all the boats on the lake , and also took into possession a schooner , which was the property of Major -LSB-
Philip -RSB- Skene	PERSON	, and furnished it out for war .

		These armed vessels are at present abundantly sufficient to command the lake .

		The making these acquisitions has greatly attached the Canadians , and more especially the Indians , to our interest .

		They have no personal prejudice or controversy with the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, but act upon political principles , and consequently are inclined to fall in with the strongest side .

		At present ours has the appearance of it , as there are at present but about seven hundred regular Troops in all the different Posts in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Add to this the consideration of the imperious and haughty conduct of the Troops which has much alienated the affections of both the Canadians and Indians from them .

		Probably there may soon be more Troops from
England	LOCATION	sent there , but at present you may rely on it that
Canada	LOCATION	is in a weak , and almost helpless condition .

		Two or three thousand men , conducted by intrepid commanders would at this juncture make a conquest of the Ministerial party in
Canada	LOCATION	, with such additional numbers as may be supposed to vie with the re-inforcements that may be sent from
England	LOCATION	.

		Such a plan would make a diversion in favour of the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	, who have been too much burdened with the calamity that should be more general , as all partake of the salutary effects of their merit and valour in the defence of the liberties of
America	LOCATION	.

		There would , furthermore , be this unspeakable advantage in directing the war into
Canada	LOCATION	, that it would unite and confirm the Canadians and Indians in our interest ; and as
England	LOCATION	can spare but a certain number of her Troops , therefore the more she needs to defend her interest in
Canada	LOCATION	, which at present is languid and weak , the less she can send to
Boston	LOCATION	, or any other part of the Continent .

		By gaining the sovereignty of
Canada	LOCATION	, would intercept the design of the Quebec
Bill	PERSON	, and greatly discourage the Ministry who dote on the efficacy of it .

		I would to God
America	LOCATION	would exert herself in proportion to the indignity offered her by a tyrannical Ministry .

		She might mount on eagle 's wings to glory .

		Fame is now hovering over her head .

		A vast Continent must either sink to bondage , ignominy and exquisite horrour , or rise triumphant above the shackles of tyranny to immortal fame .

		I hope , Gentlemen , you will use your influence in forwarding men , provisions and every article for the Army that may be thought necessary .

		Blankets and provisions are scarce .

		I might have added the article of powder .

		It ought to be observed that the Colonies must first help their friends in
Canada	LOCATION	, and then it will be in their power to help them again .

		I subscribe myself your Honours -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	TO THE
VIRGINIA ASSEMBLY	ORGANIZATION	1 Gentlemen of the Council , Mr.
Speaker	PERSON	, and Gentlemen of the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	, In answer to your joint address , presented by your deputies yesterday , I acquaint you , that it appears to me the commotions among the people , and their menances and threats -LRB- an enumeration of which I forbear , out of tenderness -RRB- have been of such public notoriety , that you must suppose many of his Majesty 's subjectsin this colony , whether they meditated or not , have at least manifested , such an inveteracy as justifies my suspicion that they would not hesitate to commit a crime , which , horrid and atrocious as it is , I had just ground to apprehend .

		And when the disposition which the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	have shewn towards me , the returns they have made to the respect and civility which I have been forward to offer to them , the countenance they have given to the violent and disorderly proceedings of the people , his Majesty 's magazine having been forced and rifled in the presence of some of the members of the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	, and , by the information of the committee the
House	ORGANIZATION	appointed to inspect the magazine , no other endeavours have been used than to prevail on the people to return the arms takenout , but not to commit the persons in whose possession they were found , in order that they might be brought to the punishment due to so heinous an offence , no less against the peace and good order of the country than the dignity and authority of the King ; when a body of men assembled in the city of
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, not only to the knowledge , but with the approbation of every body , for the avowed purpose of attacking a party of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's forces , which , without the least foundation , it was reported were marching to my protection , and which , if true , ought to have been approved and aided , not opposed and insulted , by all good and loyal subjects ; when especially the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	, or a committee of the
House	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- which is the same -RRB- has ventured upon a step fraught with the most alarming consequences , in ordering and appointing guards , without even consulting me , to mount in the city of
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, as is pretended , to protect the magazine , but which may well be doubted , as there then remained nothing therein which required being guarded ; but if otherwise , this step nevertheless shows a design to usurp the executive power , which , if it be persisted in , subverts the constitution : I say , when these circumstances are duly considered , I may submit it to your own judgment whether I could reasonably expect any good effect from communicating the ground of my uneasiness to you .

		But as you are pleased , Gentlemen , now to assure me , that you will cheerfully concur in any measure that may be proposed proper for the security of myself and family , I leave to your own consideration whether that can be effected any otherwise than by reinstating me in the full powers of my office , as his Majesty 's representative , by opening the courts of justice , and restoring the energy of the laws , which is all the security requisite for all parties ; by disarming all independent companies , or other bodies of men raised and acting in defiance of lawful authority , and by obliging those who have taken any of his Majesty 's publick store of arms to deliver them up immediately ; and , what is not less essential than any thing , by your own example , and every means , in your power , abolishing that spirit of persecution , which , to the disgrace of humanity , now reigns , and pursues with menaces and acts of oppression , all persons who differ from the multitude in political opinion , or are attached from principles and duty to the service of their King and government ; by which means the deluded people never hearing but the disfigured side of a story , their minds are continually kept in that ferment which subjects them for ever to be imposed upon , and leads to the commission of any desperate act , and endangers the general safety .

		For the more speedy accomplishment of these ends , and the great object and necessary business of the sessions , I shall have no objection to your adjourning to the town of
York	LOCATION	, where I will meet you , and remain with you till your business be finished .

		With respect to your entreaty that I should return to the palace , as the most likely means of quieting the minds of the people , I must represent to you , that , unless there be among you a sincere and active desire to seize this opportunity , now offered to you by
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, of establishing the freedom of your country upon a fixed and known foundation , and of uniting yourselves with your fellow subjects of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in one common bond of interest , and mutual assistance , my return to
Williamsburg	LOCATION	would be as fruitless to the people , as , possibly , it might be dangerous to myself .

		But if your proceedings manifest that happy disposition , which is to be desired ardently by every good friend to this as well as the mother country , I assure you , in the warmth of my heart , that I will return , with the greatest joy , and shall consider it as the most fortunate event of my life if you give me an opportunity to be an instrument of promoting your happiness , and a mediator between you and the
supreme authority	ORGANIZATION	, to obtain for you every explanation of your doubts , and the fullest conviction of the sincerity of their desire to confirm to you the undisturbed enjoyment of your rights and liberty ; and I shall be well pleased , by bringing my family back again , that you should have such a pledge of my attachment to this country , and of my wishes to cultivate a close and lasting intimacy with the inhabitants .

		A
Party	ORGANIZATION	immediately went to the Sloop which lay 'd at the Falls & plundered her , then assembled to the Number of One hundred within hail of the Schooner , & demanded her to strike to the
Sons of Liberty	ORGANIZATION	; Mr.
Moore	PERSON	enquired what they wanted , was answered Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, whom they said was onboard the Schooner .

		At 1/2 past 8 o'Clock in the Evening Mr.
Moore	PERSON	thought proper to weigh Anchor and drop down towards the Sloop which lay 'd below him ; which they discovering made themselves Masters of her , & ran her ashore .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	than anchored within
Fifteen Yards	ORGANIZATION	, with an Intent to retake her , & get her off ; he was hailed on Shore by the Rebels , once more desiring him to strike to the
Sons of Liberty	ORGANIZATION	, threatening him with Death if he resisted , upon Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's replying he was not ready yet , they fired a Volley of small Arms , which was returned from the Schooner with Swivels and Small Arms .

		The Firing continued about an hour and a half , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	then cut the Cable , drop ' t down Half a Mile lower , & anchored near a Sloop laden with Boards .

		In the Night they endeavoured to Board us with a
Number of Boats & Canoes	ORGANIZATION	, but were beat off by a brisk fire from the Swivels & obliged to quit their Boats , four of which in the Morning were left upon the Flats full of holes ; we had but one Man Wounded .

		We hauled the Sloop alongside , took in some Planks , & made a
Barricadoe	LOCATION	fore & Aft to defend ourselves from the Small Arms .

		The Captain of the Sloop being well acquainted with the
River	LOCATION	, carried us down at Daybreak , during the Passage we were continually fired at from the Shore , having a smart Breeze , in jibing , carried away our Booms and Gaff : we saw a Sloop at Anchor about a League off , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	came to an Anchor , sent his Boat aboard her , & brought her alongside , took her Boom and Gaff & fixed them in the Schooner , A Sloop & Schooner appeared , we immediately weighed Anchor & stood out for the Sea , they coming up with us very fast , we began to fire our Stern Swivels , & small Arms as soon as within reach .

		When within hail , they again desired us to strike to the
Sons of Liberty	ORGANIZATION	, promising to treat us well , but if we made any resistance they -LSB- would -RSB- put us to Death , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	seeing there was no possibility of getting clear , luffed the Vessel too and gave them a Broadside with Swivels & Small Arms in the best manner he was able , and likewise threw some Hand Grenadoes into them ; they immediately laid us Onboard , the Sloop on the Starboard Quarter , the Schooner on the Larboard Bow .

		At that Instant Mr.
Moore	PERSON	received two Balls , one in his right Breast , the other in his Belly the other Officer was slightly wounded in the Side , one Marine killed , two more Wounded , & two Seamen .

		The Rebels took Possession of the Schooner , & carried her up to Mechais , in great triumph , with their Colours flying .

		they carried Mr.

		GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Boston	LOCATION	, June 12th 1775 -LRB- No. 32 -RRB- My Lord , ... Your Lordship was informed that the Forts in
Rhode-Island	LOCATION	and New-Hampshire had been Seized by the People and the Cannon removed up the Country , and the Pieces Separated and concealed in such Manner that no clear Account was to be obtained of them .

		Those Forts and
Castle William	PERSON	excepted , there is None of Consequence from
Casco-Bay	LOCATION	to New-York .


Fort Pownall	LOCATION	on
Penobscot	LOCATION	had a few indifferent Guns , which were removed some Weeks ago by a detachment of the 64th Regiment assisted by an armed
Schooner	ORGANIZATION	; and I ca n't learn that there is any thing at
New London	LOCATION	, unless an unserviceable old Gun or perhaps two .

		Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	has sent a Ship to cruize for the four Regiments destined to
New-York	LOCATION	where it 's Judged they could be of little use in the present Situation of that Province , and to order them to join the Troops here , where the Rebels have collected their Main Force .

		Such of the Transports as can be spared will be discharged ; We are obliged now to depend upon them totally for our Subsistence ; and have used them for Magazines as well as transporting Troops .

		The Sudden Refusal of all the Colonies to Supply the Troops with Necessaries of any kind , has put us to Shifts to increase our Stock of Provisions .

		The Admiral has detained Ships with Flour and sent them in here and we have sent Transports to
Quebec	LOCATION	for Flour and so much
Flesh-Meat	PERSON	as can be procured , but as little Pork or Beef is to be had in that Province , and as it is a Chance if the King 's Ships meet with much at
Sea	LOCATION	; we have fallen upon various Means to procure Pork ; and I hope in Some we may Succeed , so as to Supply the Troops , till Sufficient Quantitys can be Sent from
Europe	LOCATION	... I am obliged to use extraordinary Means also to procure Fuel ; Contracts are made with traders in this Place to bring Coals from
Newcastle	LOCATION	, and I have applyed to Governor
-LSB- Francis -RSB- Legge	PERSON	concerning the Proposal of supplying the Troops with Coal from
Louisbourg	LOCATION	, and have at the same time tryed all Methods to get Wood from the Eastern parts of this Province , from whence the Town and all this part of the country , have usualy got their Fire-Wood .

		If Transports and other Ships sent from
England	LOCATION	took in Coals for Ballast it would help considerably .

		Forrage is another Article we are now deprived of , we send our Transports to the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	and other parts of
Nova-Scotia	LOCATION	for Hay , and to the Province of
Quebec	LOCATION	for Oats , but hope in a little Time to supply ourselves with
Hay	PERSON	with more ease .

THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Boston	LOCATION	, June 12th 1775 ... It will be Necessary also -LSB- to carry on a War -RSB- to augment the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	with a Number of Frigates , for we hear they are fitting out Vessels of Force , in Various Places , much Superior to the
Armed Sloops	ORGANIZATION	and Schooners ; and I will add the great Service that may be made of the flatbotomed Boats , used last War in landing Troops , big enough to hold Sixty Men including the Rowers ; of which we are at this Moment in very great Need .

		The Rebels have been burning Houses and driving Sheep off an Island that has an easy Communication with the Main , which drew on a Skirmish with some Marines who drove them away , but an armed Schooner that had been Sent between the Island and the Main Land , became exposed to a heavy Fire of Small Arms and two Pieces of Cannon , and unfortumately got on Shore at high Water : She was protected for a time by two Small Guns from the Ships , and two Field Pieces , but there was no Possibility of Saving her ; for as the Tide fell she was left quite dry , and burned .

		Two Men were killed , and a few Wounded .

		COLONEL
BENEDICT	PERSON	ARNOLD TO THE
CONTINENTAL CONGRESS	ORGANIZATION	1 Gentlemen , Crown Point June 13th 1775 As commanding Officer here , I think it my duty to acquaint you , that having lately sent one Mr
Hoit	PERSON	, an Indian Interpreter to
Montreal	LOCATION	, & Caughnawaga , to consult with some Gentlemen of my Acquaintance in the former Place , and with the Indians in the latter , to know their Intentions in the present dispute ー he has returned with the agreeable Intelligence that the Indians are determined not to assist the Kings Troops against us , & have made a Law , that if any one of their Tribe shall take up Arms for that purpose , he shall immediately be put to death .

		This is confirm 'd by five of their chief Men , who are now here with their
Wives & Children	ORGANIZATION	, and press very hard for our Army to march into
Canada	LOCATION	, being much disgusted with the Regulars .

		Three Stockbridge Indians , whom I lately sent to them with a
Belt of Wampum & Speech	ORGANIZATION	, confirm the above .

		My Friend in
Montreal	LOCATION	, a Merchant & Gentleman of Probity , writes that I may depend on the Truth of the above , and that great numbers of the Canadians have expected a visit from us for some time , & are very impatient of our Delay , as they are determined to join us , whenever we appear in the Country with a proper Force to support them ー This I am confirm 'd in by many of the Canadians , having just returned from a short Excursion to the Isle aux Noix -LRB-
Nuit Island	LOCATION	-RRB- where a number of them offered to Join us .

		Govr -LSB-
Guy -RSB- Carlton	PERSON	, by every artifice , has been able to raise only about 20 Canadians , and those of the Noblesse who are in Expectation of places of profit or Honor He is now at
Montreal	LOCATION	, and has threat ` nd the English Merchants , if they will not defend it in case of an Attack , he will set fire to the City & retreat to
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		There are now in
Canada	LOCATION	of the 7th & 26th Regiments only 550 effective men , who are quartered in the following Manner ー At
St. Johns & Chamblee	ORGANIZATION	300 , at
Montreal	LOCATION	40 , at
Lachine	ORGANIZATION	12 , at
Trois Riveres	ORGANIZATION	40 , at
Quebec 120	ORGANIZATION	, and some small parties at Out-Posts .

		From the foregoing matters of Facts which you may rely are undoubted , & from my personal Knowledge of the Country , and Disposition of the Canadians I beg leave to observe , that if the Honorable
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should think proper to take
Possession of Montreal & Quebec	ORGANIZATION	, I am positive 2000 Men might very easily effect it , for which purpose I beg leave to recommend the following plan of Operation .

		ー The Men to embark at Crown-Point and proceed in the Sloop , Schooner , Batteaus & c. to within two miles of
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, 1700 .

		Men to land there , a Grand Division of a 1000 .

		to proceed directly to
Montreal	LOCATION	via
Lapreira	LOCATION	, the other division of 700 .

		to cut off the Communication between
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	,
Chamblee	PERSON	, &
Montreal	LOCATION	, and the remainder to remain on board the Shipping to secure Our Retreat , who will be able to make a Diversion in favour of the Main body untill they can possess themselves of
Montreal	LOCATION	, whose Gates on our arrival at the place will be opened by our friends there , in consequence of a plan for that purpose already entered into by them ー Of Course ,
Chamblee & St Johns	ORGANIZATION	must fall into our hands as well as
Quebec	LOCATION	, unless a number of Troops should arrive there before our plan an be carried into Execution , the Utility of which the Honourable
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will be the best Judges .

		but must beg leave to observe , it appears to me that the Reduction of those places will discourage the
Enemies of American Liberty	ORGANIZATION	, & in a great Measure frustrate their cruel & unjust plan of Operation , & be a means of restoring that solid peace & Harmony between Great-Britain and her Colonies , so essential to the well being of both , at least it will in my humble Opinion , be more advantageous & attended with less expence to reduce Quebec & keep Possession , where Provisions of every kind are plenty & a strong Fortress built to our hands than rebuilding
Ticonderoga	PERSON	, as it will entirely deprive Great-Britain , of the lucrative Branch the Fur Trade , and be an inexhaustible Granary , in case we are reduced to want , as there are annually shipped from
Quebec	LOCATION	five hundred thousand Bushels of Wheat .

		I hope the Exigency of the Times , & my Zeal in the Service of my Country will apologize for the Liberty of giving my Sentiments so freely on a subject which the
Honourable Congress	ORGANIZATION	are doubtless the best Judges of , but which they in hurry may not have paid that attention to , the Matter requires .

		I beg leave to add that if no person appears who will undertake to carry the plan into execution -LRB- if thought advisable -RRB- I will undertake and with the Smiles of Heaven answer for the Success of it , provided I am supplied with men & c. to carry it into Execution without loss of time .

		I must beg leave to refer you to the Bearer , Capt -LSB-
Eleazer -RSB- Oswald	PERSON	, for particulars who is charg 'd with an imperfect memorandum of such Articles as will be wanted ー I have the Honor to be with the greatest Respect -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Benedict Arnold P.S.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The American Colonies in general are equally in Danger from
Canada	LOCATION	, whether it remain in the hands of the English under the present Form of its Government , or should be restored to the French , which many suspect is intended by the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	.

		But should ,
Canada	LOCATION	be placed under a Free Government agreeable to the English Constitution , like the other Colonies , we should forever after be secure from any danger that way , as it would ever remain an English Colony , even tho ' by the Treachery of the British Ministry it shou 'd be given up to
France	LOCATION	, so that this measure , tho ' at first view it might seem like going beyond our own province to invade the Rights of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, yet a due Regard to our own defence , as well as the advantage of the Inhabitants of that Country , makes it necessary .

James -RSB- Clinton	PERSON	and Mr.
-LSB- Christopher -RSB- Tappen	PERSON	, a committee for that purpose , reported a draft of a letter to the New-York Delegates , which was read and approved , and is in the words following , to wit : In Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, June 13th , 1775 .

		Gentlemen : In consequence of one of your Resolves , we appointed a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to view the
Post	ORGANIZATION	in the Highlands , whose report , with a map thereto annexed , you have inclosed , which is all as yet we have been able to do respecting that matter .

		As soon as the proper measures on that head are concluded we will transmit them to you .

		We are , Gentlemen -LSB- & c. -RSB- To the New-York Delegates in the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	The Report mentioned in the above letter , is in the words following , to wit : Your committee in obedience to your order of the 10th ultimo , 2 do most humbly report , that taking to their assistance Capt ,
Samuel Bayard	PERSON	and Captain
Erasmus Williams	PERSON	, they proceeded to the Highlands , and made a survey of the ground adjoining to
Hudson River	LOCATION	, for the purposes mentioned in the said order , and do report it as their opinion , that a post -LRB- capable of containing three hundred men -RRB- erected on the east bank of
Hudson	LOCATION	's river , marked A , and another on the west side of the said river , to contain 200 men , marked B in the annexed map , will answer the purpose proposed and directed by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		As it is not only the narrowest part of the said river , but best situated on account of the high hills contiguous it , as well on the west as east side of the river , which cover those parts , so that without a strong easterly wind , or the tide no vessel can pass it ; and the tide in said part of the river is generally so reverse , that a vessel is usually thrown on one side of the river or the other , by means whereof such vessels lay fair and exposed to the places your committee have fixed on .

		Your committee are further of opinion , that the cheapest and best materials to face these works , would be stone and lime , as there are plenty of stone on the same , and adjoining to it , and lime can be had from a little distance up the river .

		Your committee beg leave to observe , that they are informed that by means of four or five booms chained together on one side of the river ready to be drawn across , the passage can be closed up to prevent any vessel passing or repassing .

		Your committee are further of opinion , that if the last measure should be adopted , it would be requisite and highly prudent to place one or two cannon at the mouth of the Highlands , under the care and inspection of a faithful man , to alarm the troops to be embodied at the places proposed , in time of danger .

		Your committee are also further informed , and are of opinion that there is on the east side of the said river , near the place fixed on in the said annexed map , marked A , a good and convenient place to build a magazine for the lodgment of gunpowder and other stores .

		We believe that though there is no fresh water on the spot proposed for the east post , yet a good spring is near it , so that it can be conveyed thereto with a very small expense .

		We think it would be also necessary to build a number of small boats for maintaining a communication between the two posts .

		Your committee are unable to make a true estimate of the expense that will attend the erecting the said fortifications , but from the best computation they are able to make , it will at least amount to # 1500 .

		All of which is most humbly submitted by your committee
James Clinton Christr Tappen	PERSON	Ordered , That the foregoing letter to the New-York Delegates be engrossed , signed by the President , and -LRB- together , with a copy of the above report -RRB- transmitted by the first opportunity .

JAMES LYONS	PERSON	, CHAIRMAN OF THE
MACHIAS COMMITTEE	ORGANIZATION	, TO THE MASSACHUSETTS PROVINCIAL CONGRESS 1 Gentlemen ; We , the faithful & distressed inhabitants of
Machias	LOCATION	, beg leave , once more , in the most respectful manner , to approach your presence , & spread before you a just and full representation of our very critical situation .

		On the 2d instant Capt
Ichabod Jones	PERSON	arrived in this
River	LOCATION	with two sloops , accompanied with one of the Kings Tenders : 2 On the 3d instant , a paper was handed about for the people to sign , as a prerequisite to their obtaining anyprovisions , of which we were in great want .

		The contents of this paper , required the signers to indulge Capt
Jones	PERSON	in carrying Lumber to
Boston	LOCATION	, & to protect him and his property , at all events : But , unhappily , for him , if not for us , it soon expired after producing effects directly contrary in their nature to those intended .

		The next effort , in order to carry those favorite points , was to call a meeting , which was accordingly done .

		On the 6th the people generally assembled at the place appointed , and seemed so averse to the measures proposed , that Capt.
Jones	PERSON	privately went down to the Tender & caused her to move up so near the Town that her Guns would reach the Houses , & put springs upon her Cables , ー The people , however , not knowing what was done , and considering themselves nearly as prisoners of war , in the hands of the common enemy , -LRB- which is our only plea for suffering Capt
Jones	PERSON	to carry any Lumber to
Boston	LOCATION	, since your Honors conceived it improper -RRB- passed a Vote , that Capt
Jones	PERSON	might proceed in his Business as usual without molestation , that they would purchase the provisions he brought into the place and pay him according to Contract .

		After obtaining this Vote , Capt.
Jones	PERSON	immediately ordered his Vessells to the Wharf & distributed his provisions among those only , who voted in favour of his carrying Lumber to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		This gave such offence to the aggrieved party , that they determined to take
Capt Jones	PERSON	, if possible , & put a final stop to his supplying the Kings troops with any thing : Accordingly , they secretly invited the people of
Mispecka & Pleasant River	LOCATION	to join them ; accordingly a number of them came & having joined our people , in the woods near the settlement ; on the 11th They all agreed to take Capt
Jones	PERSON	&
Stephen Jones Esqr	PERSON	, in the place of Worship , which they attempted , but Capt
Jones	PERSON	made his escape into the woods , and does not yet appear .


Stephen Jones Esqr	PERSON	only was taken , & remains , as yet , under guard .

		The Capt 3 & Lieutenant of the Tender , were also in the
Meeting House	ORGANIZATION	, & fled to their Vessell , hoisted their flag , & sent a Message on shore to this effect : `` That he had express orders to protect Capt
Jones	PERSON	; that he was determined to do his duty whilst he had life ; & that , if the people presumed to stop Capt
Jones	PERSON	's vessels , he would bum the Town . ''

		Upon this , a party of our men went directly to stripping the sloop that lay at the wharf , and another party went off to take possession of the other sloop which lay below & brought her up nigh a Wharf , and anchored her in the stream .

		The tender did not fire , but weighed her anchors as privately as possible , and in the dusk of the evening fell down & came to , within Musket shott of the sloop , which obliged our people to slip their Cable , & run the sloop aground .

		In the mean time , a considerable number of our people went down in boats and canoes , lined the shore directly opposite to the Tender , and having demanded her to surrender to
America	LOCATION	, received for answer , `` fire and be damn 'd '' : they immediately fired in upon her , which she returned , and a smart engagement ensued .

		The Tender , at last , sliped her Cable and fell down to a small sloop , commanded by Capt.
-- Toby	PERSON	, and lashed herself to her for the remainder of the night .

		In the morning of the 12th , They took
Capt Toby	PERSON	out of his vessell , for a pilot , & made all the sail they could to get off , as the wind & tide favoured ; but having carried away her main boom , and meeting with a sloop from the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, they came to , robbed the sloop of her boom & gaff , took almost all her provision , together with Mr
Robert Avery	PERSON	of
Norwich	LOCATION	, in
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and proceeded on her voyage .

		Our people , seeing her go off in the morning , determined to follow her .

		About forty men , armed with guns , swords , axes & pick forks , went in Capt
Jones	PERSON	's sloop , under the command of Capt
Jeremiah OBrian	PERSON	: about Twenty , armed in the same manner , & under the command of Capt
Benjamin Foster	PERSON	, went in a small Schooner .

		During the Chase , our people built them breast works of pine boards , and any thing they could find in the Vessels , that would screen them from the enemy 's fire .

		The Tender , upon the first appearance of our people , cut her boats from the stem , & made all the sail she could ー but being a very dull sailor , they soon came up with her , and a most obstinate engagement ensued , both .

		sides being determined to conquer or die : but the Tender was obliged to yield , her Captain was wounded in the breast with two balls , of which wounds he died next morning : poor Mr
Avery	PERSON	was killed , and one of the marines , and five wounded .

		Only one of our men was killed , and six were wounded , one of which is since dead of his wounds .

		The Battle was fought at the entrance of our harbour , & lasted for over the space of one hour .

		We have in our possession , four double fortifyed three pounders , & fourteen swivels , and a number of small arms , which we took with the Tender , besides a very small quantity of ammunition & c. Thus we have given your honors , as particular an account of this affair as possible .

		We now apply to you for advice , and for a supply of Ammunition & provisions -LRB- the latter of which we have petitioned your honours for already -RRB- which if we could be fully supply 'd with we doubt not but with the blessing of Heaven we should be prepared to defend our selves .

		ー We propose to convey the prisoners to Pownalborough Goal , as soon as possible , there to await your orders .

		ー We are , with deference , your Honors ー most Obedient Humble Servantsー By order of the Committee .

East Greenwich	LOCATION	, June 14th , 1775 Long have the good people of this colony been oppressed by your conduct , in interrupting their lawful trade , and preventing the importation of the provisions necessary for their subsistence .

		The acts of the
British Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, already filled with restrictions of trade , oppressive in the highest degree , seem by you , to be thought too lenient .

		Not controlled by those you affect to call your masters , you have detained the persons and taken away the properties of His Majesty 's American subjects , without any warrant from the acts of trade ; by which , you have greatly impeded the intercourse between this and the other colonies as well as between the different parts of this colony .

		The inhabitants expecting the interposition of the lawful authority of the colony , have borne these outrages with a patience almost criminal .

		The
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	have heard their complaints , and in consequence of an act passed by the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	this day , I demand of you the reason of your conduct towards the inhabitants of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, in ー stopping and detaining their vessels .

		And I also demand of you , that you immediately restore the two packets , belonging to some inhabitants of the town of
Providence	LOCATION	; and all other vessels belonging to the inhabitants of this colony which you have taken and unjustly detained .

		So long as you remain in the colony , and demean yourself as becomes your office , you may depend upon the protection of the laws , and every assistance for promoting the public service , in my power .

		And you may also be assured that the whole power of this colony will be exerted to secure the persons and properties of the inhabitants against every lawless invader .

		An immediate answer is requested to this letter .

JOHN WENTWORTH	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF NEW HAMPSHIRE , TO GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Fort William	LOCATION	and
Mary	PERSON	, June 15 , 1775 The spirit of outrage runs so high that on Tuesday last -LSB- June 13 -RSB- my house was beset by great bodies of armed men who proceeded to such length of violence as to bring a cannon directly before my house , and point it at my door , threatening fire and destruction unless Mr.
Fenton	PERSON	-LRB- a member of the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	sitting -RRB- who happened to call upon me , and against whom they had taken up such resentment as occasioned him some days to retire on board a man-of-war in the
Harbour	LOCATION	out of their way , should instantly deliver himself up to them ; and notwithstanding every effort to procure effectual resistance to disperse the multitude , Mr.
Fenton	PERSON	was obliged to surrender himself , and they have carried him to
Exeter	LOCATION	about fifteen miles from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	where he is , as I am informed , kept in confinement .

		Seeing every idea of the respect due to his
Majesty 's Commission	ORGANIZATION	so far lost in the frantic rage and fury of the people as to find them to proceed to such daring violence against the Person of his Representative , I found myself under the necessity of immediately withdrawing to
Fort William	LOCATION	and
Mary	PERSON	, both to prevent as much as may be a Repetition of the like insults and to provide for my own security .

		I think it exceedingly for the King 's service to remain as long as possible at the
Fort	LOCATION	, where I now am with my Family in a small incommodious house without any other prospect of safety , if the prevailing madness of the people should follow me hither , than the hope of retreating on board his Majesty 's ship
Scarborough	PERSON	, if it should be in my power .

		This fort , although containing upwards of sixty pieces Cannon , is without men or ammunition .

Portsmouth	LOCATION	, as to make it necessary for me to retire to
Fort William	LOCATION	and
Mary	PERSON	, which is entirely in a defenceless State , without Accomodation , and altogether insecure , in case the prevailing Madness of the People should follow me hither , so that although the King 's Service requires my remaining at the
Fort	LOCATION	as long as possible , yet I have no Prospect of Safety but in the hope of retreating On board the
Scarborough	PERSON	.

		Captain
Barkley	PERSON	communicated to me your desire of having the small Cannon in this Fort , being only nine four

		`` TO THE SOLDIERS AND SEAMEN SERVING IN THE BRITISH FLEET AND ARMY IN AMERICA '' 1 Gentlemen :
Salem	LOCATION	, June 15 , 1775 Your situation is very unhappy , being dishonoured by the most infamous service , and under the command of the most vile and miserable wretches that ever disgraced the name of Briton .

		General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, to his eternal infamy , has commenced a thief , robber , murderer , and common butcher of his fellowmen ; he has violated the most solemn compacts , and become an apostate to every thing that is honourable or virtuous ... Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	has added to the crimes of a common pirate , that of forcing Americans , whom he hath impressed , to act against their own countrymen .

		Turks and Indians would scorn such rascally conduct , and surely every British soldier and seamen must detest such an odious scoundrel .

		Gentlemen , the Americans will entertain a respect for you , consider you as their brethren , and wish to live in harmony with you , and to make you free citizens of
America	LOCATION	.

		May you soon be freed from the service of tyrants , become the glorious defenders of freedom , and join the victorious Americans .

Greenwich	LOCATION	, June 15 , 1775 Sir : I take this opportunity to acquaint your Honour of the situation of the troops under my immediate command .

		One Company of my Regiment , you are sensible , is ordered to
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	; five more are stationed betwixt
NewHaven	LOCATION	and this Town , and four are in this place .

		Colonel -LSB-
David	PERSON	-RSB-
Waterbury	LOCATION	's Regiment are all in this Town and
Stamford	LOCATION	.

		The safety of the Country may possibly require my marching to New-York before I can have your orders .

		would , therefore , beg of your Honour to direct me to march my Troops to
Newy	PERSON	ork upon application made to me for that purpose by their Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Your Honour will perhaps think it expedient , when you read a letter which I have just received from Mr.
-LSB- Isaac -RSB- Sears	PERSON	... 2 I would also acquaint your Honour that all the military stores which were at
Turtle Bay	LOCATION	have fallen into our hands , consisting of too many articles to be enumerated in a letter , among which there are about five hundred good horse harnesses , a very considerable number of thirteen and ten-inch carcasses , cohorns , and stink pots , all well charged ; a very great plenty of grape-shot ; cannon ball , from twenty-four pounders down to three , & c. , & c. ; a part of which articles I shall keep with me , but the greater part I shall send to New-Haven .

		Your Honour can not be unacquainted that provisions , stores , & c. , can be forwarded along the Sound by water with much greater dispatch and vastly less cost to the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	than by land ; however , at present it is difficult , on account of the tenders and cutters which are perpetually about .

		We have at
New Haven	LOCATION	a number of cannon ; I have with me all other kinds of military stores , except powder , requisite for a guardcosta ; Mr.
-LSB- Peter	PERSON	-RSB- Colt , of
New-Haven	LOCATION	, has a fine vessel very proper for the business .

		We have in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	a very sufficient number of men well acquainted with the seas , and good resolute fellows , and it is my opinion , that the additional cost to the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	will be nothing more than the hire of the vessel and the powder ; that about a hundred of the men under my command can not be employed in any way so much to the advantage of the Country .

		Instant I beg leave to acquaint You that Colonel
Fenton	PERSON	who has been these three Weeks Onboard of the Scarborough for Protection , went to
Town	ORGANIZATION	as being a Member of their Assembly which was to have met that day , the populous hearing of his coming to
Town	ORGANIZATION	assembled in a large body to seize him , he took shelter in the Governor 's
House	ORGANIZATION	, which they immediately surrounded , and got two pieces of Cannon planted against the Door and declared that if he was not delivered up in five Minutes they would set fire to the
House	ORGANIZATION	, he then surrendered himself to them , and they have carried him into the Country , my Boat happen 'd to go to Town , a little while after the tumult was over , the Governor thought proper to retire from the Town in her , he and his family are now at the Castle , and I believe they intend to remain there ; You may depend I shall give him every aid and protection in my power .

		I beg leave to observe to You , that it will be impossible for me to put in Execution effectually the Duty of this Port without some more force , as there is one or two inlets into this
Harbour	LOCATION	where Vessels may get to
Town	LOCATION	without my Knowledge and there is likewise a
Harbour	LOCATION	called
Old York	LOCATION	, about four Miles to the Eastward , where Vessels of 150 Tons may go in and send their Cargoes to the Town .

		It will be impossible to put into Execution the several powers in the Restraining Bills except there is some Vessel to cruize off and to come in here occasionally : Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	acquaints me he will write to You upon that Subject .

		I am still informed they are making Carriages at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	in order to mount Guns and when compleated they are to mount them somewhere , but in what part it is not yet known .

		I am at present upon pretty good terms with the People of the Town , how long it may remain is very uncertain .

		I send this by Mr
Turner Master of the Scarborough	PERSON	in the Spinckes Sloop ; I have sent by him
Demands for Warrant Officers Stores	ORGANIZATION	which You will be pleased to approve of .

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	1
Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	16 June 1775 ... The Rebels landed again the 29th upon
Noddles Island	LOCATION	, drove off the Sheep and Cattle and entirely destroyed all the Dwellings and Outhouses , Barns , Stables and Hay on the
Island	LOCATION	; We have saved great part of the
Kings Stores	ORGANIZATION	, but some are unavoidably lost .

		Among the Houses destroyed by the Rebels are those mentioned in my Letter January 8 to be hired for the use of the
Glasgow	LOCATION	, when she was repaired ; finding they would be very useful for holding Tar , Pitch , Junk , Lumber and many other Articles the Store Schooner could not conveniently keep with the other Stores necessary for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, I continued to rent them until they were destroyed as above mentioned .

		The Falcon came to
Boston	LOCATION	the 2d instant ... Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Linzee	PERSON	has lost his Gunner , Surgeon 's Mate , a Midshipman , eight Seamen and three Marines , whom he sent in a Sloop to seize a Smugler in
Buzzards Bay	LOCATION	; returning with the Smugler they were attacked by a Vessel from
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	, taken and carried in there , and I am informed sent Prisoners up the Country , many of them wounded .

		The
Charming Nancy Transport	ORGANIZATION	with Cloaths and Stores for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	arrived the fourth instant with the
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	, who had been cruizing for her ever since her arrival from
England	LOCATION	.

		By a Letter from Captain
-LSB- George -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	dated the 6th of May , I am informed that Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, expecting to be attacked every moment , had requested assistance , that Captain
Montagu	PERSON	had sent a Lieutenant with a party of Seamen , an Officer of Marines with his
Party	ORGANIZATION	, and some of the Magdalens people , to the palace at
Williamsburgh	LOCATION	; Captain
Montagu	PERSON	at the same time wrote to the president who resides at
York	ORGANIZATION	to acquaint him that if any of the Kings People were attacked going to assist the Governor he would fire on the Town .

		The Insurgents I find made no Attack , but contented themselves with taking possession of the Receiver of the
Quit Rents House	ORGANIZATION	and insisting on his giving them Bills to the amount of the Powder secured on Board the Ships .

		The
Asia	LOCATION	arrived at the Hook the 25th May and the next day moared before
New York	LOCATION	.

		Captain -LSB-
George -RSB- Vandeput	PERSON	acquaints me that he has ordered the Kingsfisher to lie at the Hook and to cruize occasionally for the Pacquets and the Troops expected to arrive there .

		That Lieutenant Governor
-LSB- Cadwallader -RSB- Colden	PERSON	is retired to
Long Island	LOCATION	, the legal authority of Government entirely suspended , and that the direction of the City is in the hands of Committees , who at present allow the
Asia	LOCATION	to be supplied with every thing wanted ; but as there is no depending upon the continuation of such an Indulgence , I have directed Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	to compleat his provisions at all opportunities , and to order Captain
James Montagu	PERSON	to do the same .

		The
Senegal	LOCATION	sailed the 6th instant for
Falmouth	LOCATION	in
Casco Bay	LOCATION	.

		I have directed Captain -LSB-
William -RSB- Duddingstone	PERSON	in addition to his general Orders respecting illicit Trade and the unlawful importation of Arms and Ammunition , to seize and send to
Boston	LOCATION	all Vessels laden with Provisions , Flour , Grain , Molasses and Salt , as well to distress the Rebels as to supply the
Army	ORGANIZATION	who are in want of some Articles of Provision .

		... I have since directed him -LSB- Captain
John Collins	PERSON	of the Nautilus -RSB- to proceed off the Hook with Orders for Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Macartney	PERSON	in the Mercury to leave the Service he was employed on to be performed by Captain
Colins	PERSON	and relieve the
Fowey	LOCATION	at
Virginia	LOCATION	as soon as possible ; And I have also directed Captain
Colins	PERSON	, after the Transports are arrived and he has delivered the
General 's Letter	ORGANIZATION	, to proceed to the
Delaware	LOCATION	, there to remain until further Orders .

		The Nautilus accordingly sailed from hence this day .

		I have ordered the
Fowey	LOCATION	to
Boston	LOCATION	with new raised men for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, from whence she shall go to
Halifax	LOCATION	to heave down .

		By the
Magdalen	LOCATION	being detained for the protection of Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, the
Delaware	LOCATION	has been left open to the Importation of prohibited Goods .

		The critical situation of the Governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and his earnest intreaty for assistance , compelled me to send a Sloop as I could not spare a large Ship .

		In
New Hampshire	LOCATION	Government and the Province of Main -LSB- e -RSB- , the people also verging on Rebellion and ripe for every Mischief , it became absolutely necessary to send a Sloop of War to
Casco Bay	PERSON	, to defend his Majesty 's Officers and peaceable Subjects in the Town of
Falmouth	LOCATION	, to seize all Supplies of Provisions , Arms and Ammunition , and in general to give Security to Vessels passing with fresh provisions and Fuel for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	and Inhabitants of
Boston	LOCATION	; I beg you will assure their Lordships that as I am actuated by the strongest desire to do what I think best for his
Majesty 's Service	ORGANIZATION	, It will give me unspeakable Satisfaction if the above reasons justify me with their Lordships for sending Sloops to
Virginia	LOCATION	, the
Delaware	LOCATION	, and
Casco Bay	LOCATION	, and leaving
Savannah	LOCATION	a little longer unsupplied .

		this Hurt to me as a Man only I could bear , but my religious profession & faithful Brethren which are nearer than any thing in my Life to Me are by me in this View Reproachd allso and which at this time when We as a people can not Stand between the Violence of Two parties but by Our Sincerity and faithfulness to the Leadings of that
Divine Principal of Truth	ORGANIZATION	which we profess to follow is truely a distressing Consideration to Me who am -LSB- undecipherable -RSB- that the

		CAPTAIN
ELIJAH HYDE	PERSON	'S ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL 1 On friday night June 17th 1775 Fifteen hundred of the provincials went to Bunker 's
Hill	PERSON	in order to intrench there and continued intrenching till saturday 10 OClock , when two thousand of the Regulars embarked from
Boston	LOCATION	, landed in
Charlestown	LOCATION	, plundered the town of all its valuable effects & then set fire to it in ten different places at once , then divided their
Army	ORGANIZATION	, one part of them marched up in the front of the provincial intrenchment & began to attack the provincials , at long shot , The other part marched round the Town of
Charlestown	LOCATION	under cover of the smoke occasioned by the fire of the Town , in order to flank the provincials .

		The provincial Sentries discovered The Regulars marching up on their left wing ; upon notice given by the Sentr -LSB- ies -RSB- to the
Connecticut	LOCATION	forces
Capn Nolton	PERSON	-LSB-
Thomas Knowlton	PERSON	-RSB- of

Capn Nolton	PERSON	gave orders to his men not to fire untill the Enemy were got within fifteen Rods and then , not till the word was given , It was observed that the first fire from
Capn Nolton	PERSON	's men , did great execution , & put the Enemy into disorder , the action continued about two hours when the Regulars gave way upon their right wing and were pursued by the
Connecticut	LOCATION	forces , until General -LSB-
Seth -RSB- Pomeroy	PERSON	ordered those who had been in action two hours to fall back & their places to be supplyed by fresh Troops , which Orders being mistaken for a direction to retreat , The Provincials upon the Right wing , began a retreat , which was communicated to the left wing the pri -LSB- nci -RSB- ple place of action , where
Captns Nolton	PERSON	-LSB-
John -RSB- Chester -LSB- James -RSB- Clarke	PERSON	and -LSB-
Israel	LOCATION	-RSB- Putnam -LSB- Jr. -RSB- with their Companies had drove the Enemy fifteen or twenty Rods back & being warmly engaged in the pursuit and on the point of pushing their Bayonets , were , not without difficulty , perswaded to retire , But the right wing having by mistaking the Orders already retreated , the left wing , to avoid being encircled , were obliged also together with the main body to retreat with precipitation across the causeway to Winter 's
Hill	PERSON	, in which retreat they were exposed to the Enemy 's fire from their Shipping and floating Batteries , where the provincials sustained the greater part of their loss .

		The
Enemy	ORGANIZATION	pursued the provincials to Winter 's H -LSB- ill -RSB- , their own Troops being reinforced by General -LSB-
Israel	LOCATION	-RSB-
Putnam	PERSON	, renued the -LSB- Battl -RSB- e with spirit , repulsed the Enemy with great Slaughter , & pursued them till they got under cover of their Cannon from the Shipping , when the Regulars retired to Bunker 's
Hill	PERSON	, & the provincials to Winter 's
Hill	PERSON	, where after entrenching and erecting Batteries , on monday our Troops began a brisk fire upon the Regulars on Bunkers Hill and u -LSB- pon -RSB- their Ships & floating Batteries ー when the express came away The number killed of the provincial troops betwixt forty and Seventy wounded a hundred and forty ー of the
Connecticut	LOCATION	forces Sixteen were killed , no Officer from
Connecticut	LOCATION	either killed or wounded except Lieut -LSB-

New Hampshire	LOCATION	was killed ー It is said that Doctr -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Warren	PERSON	is undoubtedly among the slainー The Provincials lost 3 Iron Six pounders , some in trenching tools and a few Knapsacksー The number of Regulars who first attacked the provincials was two thousand , the number of provincials fifteen hundred , The Regulars were afterwards reinforced with a thousand men ー It is uncertain how great a number of the Enemy were killed or wounded , But Spectators who saw the whole action judged that there could not be less than four or five hundred killed ; Mr
Gardner	PERSON	who got out of
Boston	LOCATION	sunday Evening says that there were five hundred wounded men brought into that place the morning before he came outー This Account was taken from

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LSB-
Preston	PERSON	,
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 17th -LSB- June , 1775 -RSB- Early in the morning the Lively gave the first Notice of the Rebels fortifying Bunkers Hill , by firing on them as they were at work ; And it was thereupon resolved by the General to attack them forthwith .

		General -LSB-
William -RSB- Howe	PERSON	and the Admiral went together on board the
Somerset	LOCATION	, intending if possible to have had that Ship warped in to cover the Landing , but there was not sufficient depth of Water : The larger Ships therefore could give no other assistance , than that of lending Boats , Men , Ammunition and other Stores to the small , which was done .

		Two Officers and thirty six Seamen were sent from the
Somerset	LOCATION	to the Symmetry armed Transport and twenty Seamen to the Falcon , to reinforce those Vessels .

		The
Preston	PERSON	manned the Spitfire Sloop of Six 3-pounders , and provided her with Ammunition , and the Boats of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	attended , and were employed wherever they could be of Use .

		As this Affair was sudden and unexpected there was no time for constructing floating Batteries , or Rafts of real Service , as any such would have been a work of some days .

		The
Glasgow	LOCATION	and Symmetry kept a constant Fire on
Charles Town Neck	LOCATION	, and two Scows with a 12 pounder in each end , manned from the Ships of War under the direction of Colonel -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- James	PERSON	, went as near to the Mill house as possible ; at first to prevent fresh Forces coming over during the Fight , and afterwards the routed from getting off : But the ebbing Tide would not admit either the Scows or small Vessels to approach within the Distance desired .

		The Lively ,
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	, and Spitfire abreast of and below
Charles Town	PERSON	covered however the Landing and continued firing so long as they could annoy the Enemy without injuring our own Troops .

		The Shot from the Lively and Battery on
Copse Hill	LOCATION	in the Morning must have done great execution in the morning for 40 men were found buried upon Bunkers Hill , and it was these must have been killed & put under ground then , as it was impossible that the Rebels could afterwards , during the heat & hurry of the Attack have had time to bury any of their dead .

		The Admiral not only offered and gave every assistance in his power , but went ashore in person to be near General
Howe	PERSON	, for the sake of seeing whether any further aid could be given , and of ordering it immediately ; & whilst he was there the General observing the mischief his left Wing sustained by the fire from
Charles Town	PERSON	, the Admiral asked him if he wished to have the place burned , and being answered Yes , he immediately sent to the Ships to fire red hot Balls -LRB- which had been prepared with that in View -RRB- , and also to
Copse Hill Battery	ORGANIZATION	to desire they would throw Carcasses , into the Town ; and thereby it was instantly set on fire in many places , and the Enemy quickly forced from that station .

		In consequence of intelligence this day the Admiral acquainted the Commanders of the cruizing Vessels that the Rebels had fishing Boats , out watching for their homeward bound Trade to direct them to avoid our Cruizers by going for
Newbury Port	LOCATION	.

		And the Commanders of the Kings Ships were enjoined to be vigilant in frequently examining the Coast as far as
Piscataqua	LOCATION	, and to impress as many Seamen as possible and not to spare even their Fishermen .

Pirates	ORGANIZATION	into some Confusion , and they endeavoured to make off , but were prevented by an anned Packet Boat , in the Service of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, that had by this Time come up ; the
Pirates	ORGANIZATION	finding they could not escape , ran the Vessel ashore on Connanicut , and went off with much Precipitation .

Fowey	LOCATION	in
York River	LOCATION	, 17th of June 1775 Sir , I have received the Letter with which you have favoured me by Capt -LSB-
Matthew -RSB- Squires	PERSON	, and I thank you as well for that as the assistance which by the Otter Sloop You have sent to His Majesty 's Government in this Colony .

		After having seen the greatest part of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	in Arms , and suffered continual insults accompanied by threats of the utmost violence against my Person , upon so slight a pretence as my having removed Gun Powder afforded them ; and finding that the meeting of the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, which I have called together for the purpose of taking into Consideration the Plan of reconciliation held out by the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, has served only to increase the Tumults in and the disorders of the Country , I have thought it most Conducive to the good of His Majesty 's Service to fix my residence onboard the Fowey .

		I have found by experience that I could rely on no protection but such as was furnished me , by the Zeal of Captain
-LSB- George -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	, from His Majesty 's Ships under his
Command	ORGANIZATION	; and as the marching the few Men he could be able to spare me , through a covered Country the distance of several
Miles	PERSON	, exposes them to very great risk from the Superior number of the People who have made no hesitation at declaring their intention of attacking them , I thought it most prudent to avoid such unequal contests , and for the preventing of the shedding of Blood I have resolved to quit the Place where the Governors usually reside , which is at the distance of some Miles from any Place where the Men of War can approach , and consequently lies at the mercy of the People , and to retire to the only safe retreat at present in the Colony for any Officer of the Crown ; and my Intention is to remain in this Situation until I receive Instructions from His Majesty , for the procuring of which , and for the conveying of the most speedy Intelligence of these transactions to His Majesty , I have applied to Captain
Montagu	PERSON	to dispatch Mr -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Collins	PERSON	with the
Magdalen	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	; in conformity to which she is to sail immediately If the Circumstances of the Service at
Boston	LOCATION	, and His Majesty 's orders to you permit , I am still in hopes that you will augment the
Sea Force	ORGANIZATION	in this part of
America	LOCATION	as much as will be possible , as the keeping of these considerable Countries lying upon the great Rivers which empty into the
Bay of Chesapeake	LOCATION	in awe can not but contribute much to the Success of the General Plan for enforcing the
Authority of Government	ORGANIZATION	in the Colonies .

		It were to be wished that small Vessels could be kept constantly passing from Station to Station along the Coast for the purpose of regular and uninterrupted intelligence between all the ports where any of His Majesty 's Servants are employed ; who by these means may mutually aid each other .

		The land Conveyance is no longer to be depended upon .

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 Sir
Fowey	PERSON	at

Army	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	on his Agents here -LRB-
Messrs Gibson Donaldson & Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with a Quantity of Pork , And they finding it dangerous to Answer the same made Application to His Excellency the Earl of
Dunmore	PERSON	to fall on a Method of having it safely and secretly procured ; And that in consideration of the rebellious
State of the Country	LOCATION	, And having a Consultation with his Lordship have fallen on a Plan of seizing a
Brigantine	LOCATION	loaded with Pork and cleared out for
Antigua	LOCATION	, and send Mr.
Crawley	PERSON	in Charge with her to
Boston	LOCATION	ー The Master of her having proper Instructions on that head , And hope You will approve my Conduct herein , As the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	have positively threatned and forbid the Contractor at
Norfolk	LOCATION	to supply any of his Majesty 's Ships with more Provisions than what the said Ships can consume within themselves , as by that means they prevent any being carried to the Fleet .

		I take this Opportunity of acquainting You with the arrival of his Majesty 's Sloop Otter the 10th Instant , as also the Arundle Schooner , And am honoured with your Order of 21st .

		of May and Letter of the same and 22d ー Also the Dispatches ; Captains -LSB-
Edward -RSB- Thornborough	PERSON	and -LSB-
Francis -RSB- Parry	PERSON	's I have not as yet had an Opportunity of sending , but shall embrace One that will soon offer , for His Excellency the Earl of
Dunmore	PERSON	has thought proper to apply to me to send two Vessels that had formerly been seized and condemned in the Court of Admiralty , A Sloop by Lieutenant -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Colins	PERSON	And the Sally Schooner by me -LRB- and of which my former Letters informed You -RRB- to St Augustine to bring Troops , And that in their way there , they shall deliver the dispatches .

		Agreeable to the part of your Letter of the 21st of May I had ordered Lieutenant
Colins	PERSON	to prepare for his Station , But thought it prudent to heave the Schooner down here under the Protection of his Majesty 's Ships , And which she is doing alongside the Otter .

		I beg leave to acquaint You that on the 7th Instant the Governor was abliged with his Family to leave Williamsburgh and come Onboard the Fowey for Safety ; as has some other of the Inhabitants ; And that his Lordship has thought it proper to give the most speedy Accounts of the same to the King , and has applied to me to dispatch the
Magdalen	ORGANIZATION	on that
Service	ORGANIZATION	, which I shall do and inclosed transmit You a Copy of his Lordship 's Letter .

		From the hostile Appearance of the Country I can not think it prudent to leave the Station until I have You -LSB- r -RSB- further Order , or relieved by another Ship , which I hope will be soon as the Ship and Boats are in great want of Repairs , and Stores of most kind ー Your Order of the 21st of May requires my proceeding directly to
Halifax	LOCATION	, when I leave this Province , but as your prior Order directs my raising 100 Men and represented the fleet being in want of Biscuit , shall think it prudent to put into
Boston	LOCATION	to deliver the Men and Bread as You may please to direct .

Stuart	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- Superintendent of Indian Affairs , having had information of an intention in the
Carolina Committee	ORGANIZATION	to seize his person , thought proper , to remove from
Charles Town	LOCATION	, to
Savannah	LOCATION	in
Georgia	LOCATION	where he imagined he would find safety , but two Members of the Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	then sitting at
Charles Town	LOCATION	were sent from thence , to inflame the minds of the people in
Georgia	LOCATION	, and to induce them , to secure him , pretending that he had used his influence to induce the Indians in his district -LRB- particularly the Cherokees and the
Catawbas	ORGANIZATION	, -RRB- to fall upon the back inhabitants of the province and make a diversion to facilitate the landing of Troops said to be expected ; these Emissaries succeeded so well , as to render it absolutely necessary for him to leave
Savannah	LOCATION	to avoid falling into the hands of a furious Mob , which he luckily effected in time enough by some Minutes , and requested of me , to carry him to
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, to which , with the approbation of Sir
James Wright	PERSON	I consented : When Mr

Pybees	LOCATION	-LSB-
Tybee -RSB- Island	LOCATION	, the entrance of
Savannah River	LOCATION	, with what intention I know not , Soon afterwards a boat from
Savannah	LOCATION	with some of the principal people and leaders of the disaffected party attempted to pass by me , in order to join the Carolinians but I conceived it , to be for the good of His Majesty 's Service , and my duty to prevent their meeting , and I accordingly obliged them to return , and immediately afterwards the Carolians in their Cannoes went home .

		The next Morning a number of armed Men appeared on the beach and upon my making sail fired a Musket and hoisted the American Liberty Flag on
Tybees Light House	ORGANIZATION	; I think proper to give you this information , by which it will appear that Anarchy and a total subversion of Government has taken place in

		CAPTAIN
EDWARD MEDOWS	PERSON	, R.N. , TO VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 Sir , Tartar Halifax June 19 , 1775 I received your Letter of the 3d June the 14th of this month relative to the Guns for the Schooners , and the Dispatch of the Service , which I shall have great satisfaction in forwarding as much as I possibly can .

		I think it my duty to acquaint you , Sir , that his Majesty 's Ship under my Command is rendered in a very weak state of defence by sending a Detachment of twenty men to do duty in the Yard , as we have only twenty eight remaining in a Watch , which I must -LRB- and hope you will -RRB- think is being too weak at such a time as this .

		I have applied to the commanding Officer of the Troops to know if he could spare men to do duty in the Yard , but he has informed me that they are so very weak that it is absolutely out of his power to give any assistance , so that I can not help looking upon the Garrison here to be in a very weak state , and hoping that you will think more force necessary at so critical a time and where there is so great an Object to attend to as the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	Yard must be at present .

		I have lent the
Halifax	LOCATION	some men to fit her rigging , and shall be happy to give every assistance in my power towards forwarding the Service at so material a time .

		I much fear , Sir , the Rebels have too many friends here , so that I suppose they will be made acquainted with the strength of the Garrison here which I should be afraid at present might give them great Encouragement to hope for Success , provided it continues in the weak State it is at present both by Sea and Land , which Consideration made me think it my duty at this time to point out the weak State of the Ship at present ; but for the number of men we have , Sir , I have the Satisfaction to think we should do as much as could be expected from us with great Chearfulness and good Will .

		We have lost one of our Masters Mates , Sir , and the Master himself is in a very declining way , so that we are weak at present with regard to Officers as well as Men .

Mistick River	LOCATION	or
Bay	LOCATION	, the Water on our right , where they still remain ; they cover that flank and now and then take a shot at the fellows who come down among the ruins to fire at our Men at Work ; had these boats been with us on Saturday at the time of the Attack they cou 'd have been of great use , as they wou 'd have taken a part of the Rebels intrenchment in flank and in their retreat wou 'd have cut off numbers ; instead of that they were on the other side and of no manner of use .

		DIARY OF PETER EDES 1 -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- June 19 , 1775 .

		About eight o'clock in the morning , being in
Edes & Gill	ORGANIZATION	's office , 2 three men belonging to the ships of war appeared round the office and having been previously informed of their pressing every person into the service who happened to fall in their way , I ran out of a back door which conducted into the lane that led to my father 's house , thither I repaired ; but the bloodhounds were immediately informed of my retreat and speedily followed me , and the dwelling almost instantly surrounded by sailors and three officers .

		I soon was made a prisoner , and had the misfortune to find myself in the hands of the most unfeeling and worthless set of men , ー one of whom upon first discovering me cried out , `` I have found the damned rebel . ''

		The fellow had a cutlass drawn in his hand , and pulled me to the officers , one of w horn was Capt.
Lindsay	PERSON	; 3 he asked me where Mr.
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Edes	PERSON	was , I answered he was out of town ; he replied , that I was a damned liar , and that I had better tell him ; he repeated the question , I answered as before ; he asked me if I was Mr.
Edes	PERSON	the printer 's son , I told him I was ; upon which he ordered me with him ; observing that he was commanded so to do , I said it was very well , and followed him .

		After we had got to
New Boston	LOCATION	, he asked me what my father had been writing to me , I replied nothing ; then what I had been writing him ー nothing ; he said , `` I was right in saying so , but that he would be damned if he would believe me . ''

		We afterwards proceeded towards the Admirals , 4 and passing by my father 's house ,
Lindsey	PERSON	discovered Mr.
Starr	PERSON	with a firelock ; upon which he ordered me to stop , for there was a trooper with a firelock .

		He was soon brought where I was , and both placed in the centre of a circle formed of six sailors , who were as hardened and inhuman as Turks , and were commanded to go on .

		Being a little animated I said , Capt.
Lindsey	PERSON	, I should be much obliged to you , if you would carry me to the General 's , 5 and see whether he will release me , or what he will do with me .

		He said he was not to go where I pleased , but that I should go where he pleased to carry me , `` and damn you , if you ask me another question , I 'll knock you down , by God . ''

		He then sent us to the Admiral 's , with an officer and a few sailors ; when we were before the Admiral , he asked me my name : I replied
Edes	PERSON	; he said I looked like a dirty villain , and ordered his officer to carry us to the provost , with orders to hang us immediately ; but looking round he saw a sailor with a firelock , upon which he asked the officer if it was found with us ; being informed it was , he ordered his officer to carry us to General
Gage	PERSON	, and he would know what to do with us .

		When we came before his excellency ,
Harry Rooke	PERSON	, one of his aid-de-camps , asked me how many more firelocks I had in the house , I replied , five or six more for aught I knew , for I was ignorant of that one being there ; he told me that I would wish I had given it up ; another officer called a serjeant of the horse , and ordered him to draw his cutlass and carry us back to the Admiral 's , but observed to him , if we offered to run , -LRB- made a sign by drawing his hand across his throat ;-RRB- we set off , but soon an officer overtook us , and gave us orders to stop .

		The serjeant ordered us to lay on the ground , and in about a quarter of an hour another officer came and acquainted us that we must go to the General 's again , which we did , and tarried there about half an hour , after which they called a corporal , gave him a billet , and ordered a file of men to take us to the provost ; and to fall into the hands of a more worthless , infamous fellow , I do n't wish my enemies .

Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	ー In consequence of this , I sent the two packets out different ways to reconnoitre ; Unluckily One of them fell in with two of their Sloops , and after an Action of half an Hour was run onshore , the particulars of which is inclosed , given me by the Officer who commanded Onboard ー At this time I had four or five Vessels loaded with Provisions upon the point of Sailing to
Boston	LOCATION	, the Owners agreeing with me for their Proceedings ー After setling this matter and hearing the
Pirates	ORGANIZATION	were at Anchor about four Leagues from Us ー I got under Weigh as secret as possible , expecting to fall upon them by Surprize ー However they got Intelligence and moved higher up towards
Providence	LOCATION	in shallow Water , where it was not proper for us to pursue them ー On our return to
Newport	LOCATION	we found a great number of the Towns People had taken advantage of our absence , Arm 'd a number of Boats and Vessels ー taken the Victuallers , carried them to Town , dismantled & unloaded them , and this done in the space of two or three hours .

		this procedure , together with their behaviour on hearing of an Action in the

Connecticut	LOCATION	and got onshore with the People and part of the Small Arms ー They immediately landed a number of Men from the Vessels in whale Boats who closely pursued ー and fired at Us ー being so closely pursued and night coming on thought it necessary to separate and conceal Ourselves till a proper Opportunity offered of joining the Ship which was accomplished the next day without the loss of one Man .

Newport	LOCATION	, June 19 .

		Last Thursday -LSB- June 15 -RSB- one of the Providence packets , which had been arbitrarily seized by , and detained as a tender to , the men of war in this harbour , was sent up the
Bay	LOCATION	, 't is supposed , to take a vessel which 't was reported had gone up the back side of
Connanicut	LOCATION	; but unluckily she met with two arm 'd vessels which fired upon her so warmly that she was obliged to tum tailto , but not being able to get off , the people stuck her ashore on the north end of
Connanicut	LOCATION	, and left her ; she was immediately got off , and carried away , most probably to be delivered to her proper owner .

		This happened just before sunset .

		Last Friday evening when the men of war in our harbour were shifting their watches , a number of musket-balls were fired into the town , one of which entered a closet window of a house on Gravelly-point , just to the northward of the Long wharf , went through the closet-door , and made a considerable dent in a door in the opposite corner of the room adjoining the closet ; by which one or two persons narrowly escaped being killed or wounded .

		Last Saturday , it being reported that 2 American vessels of force , were lying in
Narragansett Bay	LOCATION	, Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	of the ship Rose , Capt. -LSB-
James -RSB- Ayscough	PERSON	, of the Swan , and a Tender , came to sail , and first beat out within about 2 miles of the Light house , when they bore away , and ran up the river as far as Connanicut point , and took a peep down
Narraganset Bay	LOCATION	; but not discovering any vessels , they returned to their station in this harbour ; while they were on this short , and unsuccessful cruise , a number of people boarded and carried off , 5 vessels , which men of war had taken , and left riding in the road .

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM
NEWPORT	LOCATION	, DATED MONDAY , JUNE 19 , 1775 '' 1 On Thursday last -LSB- June 15 -RSB- , as one of the packets which had been piratically seized and detained by Captain
-LSB- James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	, was cruizing as a tender , in the Naraganset-Bay , in quest of plunder , as usual , she spoke with an armed sloop , fitted out by the colony for the protection of its trade , whose commander not answering in a tone sufficiently submissive , was fired upon by the tender ; the compliment was returned with such effect as to put the
Pirates	ORGANIZATION	into some confusion , and they endeavoured to make off , but were prevented by an armed packet boat , in the service of the colony , that had by this time come up ; the pirates finding they could not escape , ran the vessel ashore on Connanicut , and went off with much precipitation .

		The firing on both sides continued some minutes , though none of our people was hurt , and but one of the pirates wounded .

		On board the packet retaken were found eight swivels , seventeen stands of arms , a number of pistols , cutlasses , cartouch-boxes , & c. 1 .

Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	and all his men .

		It is but little credited .

		... Our Burgesses from the County are not yet returned from
Willmsbg	LOCATION	.

		where they hold their
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		So I can not give you any particulars of their proceedings .

		The news papers will do that I expect : I understand Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	by deserting his Palace & taking Sanctuary on board the Ship of War , under the pretence of the fear of an Attack on his person , has surprized & incensed them much , As they thought it incredible he should be actuated on that occasion by the Motives he alledges .

		It is judged more likely to have proceeded from some intelligence or Instructions he has received from his friends or superiors to the North .

		It is said the Governor of N
Caroliana	PERSON	has treated his Assembly nearly in the same manner .

		Some will have it that Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	removed from

		& pretended danger that he might with more force & consistency misrepresent us to the ministry .

		His unparralled malice to the people of this Colony since the detection of his false & wicked letters , sent home at the time he was professing an ardent friendship for us must lead us to suppose he will do us all the Injury in his power .

Hyde	PERSON	of this Town , the sum of his Information as I recollect it , is , viz about 1500 , of the
Massachusetts & Connecticut Troops	ORGANIZATION	by Order possesd Them selves of Bunkers Hill Fryday night , & had made great Progress , in intrenchments , by the Light of next momg but not prepared to use what small Cannon they had , soon as they were discovered the Ships within reach , & a number of floating Batterys mounted with Cannon , which had been prepared began a heavy Fire upon them , but did not greatly annoy Them at first , about Two thousand regular Troops also immediately crosed over to
Charlestown	LOCATION	, & set the Town in Flames in various parts -LRB- which all but a few scattered Houses is consumed -RRB- & approached to Attack the
Hill	PERSON	, The Provincials sent of -LSB- f -RSB- for reinforcements & in the mean
Time	ORGANIZATION	bravely repulsed the Enemy Recruits arrived before they had got very near , & kept their Fire tho perpetually fired upon , till the Enemy got within abt 15 rods & then gave it a full loose brodside as They conceive very great Destruction upon them mowing down whole ranks of them 12 deep , till They began to retreat apace , & the left of our Troops leapd their breastwork of a rail fence & pursued them fast abt 20 rods , when perceiving their own right gave way , -LRB- which tis found was occasioned by Genl -LSB-
Seth -RSB- Pumroys -LSB- Pomeroy	PERSON	-RSB- , ordering them , who were then in Front & had been on Fatigue all night faint & hungry , to give back , intending only to make room for recruits just come up , but in the Confusion it was misunderstood & they all retreated on that wing -RRB- our Troops perceiving their right to be giving back , & at the same
Time	ORGANIZATION	a large Detachment of the Regulars who had unperceived , made a large circular march to the westward partly across
Greens Hill	LOCATION	above Them forcing into their Post & Intrenchment which they had almost deserted , it was apparently prudent & necessary all to retreat which they did , without precipitation carrying off all their wounded men , & possessed themselves of Greens Hill next above Bunkers , which they are now holding & fortifying & have done much to strengthen , leaving the latter in possession of the Enemy which They are also fortifying , & firing of the Cannon continued by turns , when Mr
Hyde	PERSON	left the
Camp	LOCATION	yesterday Morng 10 , oClo , some of our
Soldiers Packs & Baggage	ORGANIZATION	fell into the Enemys hands , the Tools perhaps all & two or 3 field peices all they had with Them , as near as co 'd be come at We had lost in all between 40 & 70 killd & 140 wounded , They have lost tis not doubted many more , but We know not the Number a man escaped from

		GOVERNOR SIR
JAMES WRIGHT	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 No 51 Sav .

		in
Georgia	LOCATION	20 June 1775 .

		My Lord , The Liberty people have now got another pretence for raising men , they assert that Mr. -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB- Stuart the Superintendant has been endeavouring to raise the Cherokee Indians to come down against them , this they alledge that they have got undoubted proof of , and all he can say will not convince them to the Contrary , his Friends in
Charles Town	PERSON	gave him a hint , and he left that and came here but they sent some of their party here who have so inflam 'd & enrag 'd our People , that he did not think himself safe , and His Majesty 's armed Schooner St.
John	PERSON	having put in from -LSB- New -RSB-
Providence	LOCATION	, he went on boarq her & I suppose by this time is saild for
St. Augustine	LOCATION	.

		And several Boats full of men from the
Carolina	LOCATION	side , have been down at our Inlet some days , the Accounts differ as to No .

		some call them 50 others 80 all well & completely arm 'd .

		Some alledge their intention was to seize on Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	which very probably was part of their errand , But I believe they have another point in view and that is 3 Vessells being expected here from
London	LOCATION	and a considerable quantity of Gun Powder being on board for the Indian Trade , they intend to seize on that & carry it to
Carolina	LOCATION	and this is certainly in their power to do and its not possible to prevent it , if attempted and one of these
Vessells	PERSON	arrived here on Saturday the 18th inst .

		& the Capt. one Ash informs me that several Boats lay off a little way from him & that one with 3 or 4 men came on board and one of them inquir 'd whether he had any Gun Powder on board and on showing his Cockets and their finding he had none they behaved very civilly and went away , but made great inquiry after another ship one
Maitland	PERSON	who has a large quantity of Gun Powder on board and it is said they intend to watch our
Inlet	LOCATION	till the others come and to take out all the Gun Powder And if that is the case I am much afraid it will embarass us with the Indians for they have for some time being very impatient for their usual supplys and in order to pacify them I have told them that the difference we had with them last year prevented the Merchants from sending for goods , that none was wrote for till after our disputes were settled in
Octr	LOCATION	last and that it takes a great while for ships to carry letters and orders from hence to
England	LOCATION	and that then the goods would be to make -LRB- I told them this to gain time -RRB- and afterwards be sent here and that sometimes ships had very long passages and we would not depend on a supply till late in the summer and with this they were tolerably well satisfied , but if they are now disappointed they will conclude we have some design against them and I ca n't tell what may be the consequence for they are a very jealous suspicious people and as they have been told by the
Chickesaw Indians	ORGANIZATION	that the White people are going to join the Chactaws against them it may confirm that report and thus Your Lordship sees the state we are in in every respect and no King 's Sloop or
Cruizer	PERSON	heard of yet .

		I have now the honor to inform your Lordship that the Officers and Men of the

Corps	ORGANIZATION	acquired in that Day was very much damp 'd by the loss of Many brave Officers who then fell ー in particular that of Major
Pitcairn	PERSON	, who was wounded a few Minutes before the Attack was made on the Redoubt and he died about two or three hours after , his loss is greatly regreted by the whole
Corps	ORGANIZATION	who held him in very great Estimation .

JOHN BROWN	PERSON	TO
MOSES BROWN	PERSON	1 Dr Brother Providence June 21st , 1775 Your kind favour of the 16th Inst is before me , I am Really Sorry that my takeing out a writt against Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	should be so disagreeable to Your Centiments .

		if I am not Much Mistaken I said in Your presents more than once that I was Determined to take the Law of him Either here or in
England	LOCATION	, and should have done it Sooner had I have Determined which would Likely have proved the most to my Interest , but the more I thought of it the More Convinced I was that he ought to be
Servd	PERSON	here , and that his being Obloiged to give Bale in so large a Sum of Money would take of -LSB- f -RSB- So much of his
Haughtey Beheaver	PERSON	when he Considerd that the more he Opressed the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	or its Inhabitants , the Larger the Sum would be Recoverd against him and if it should have this Effect -LRB- which I think Very Likely it would -RRB- in Lue of the Disadvantage which you Seem to fear nought in Consequence theirof Arise to my and my
Friends Interest	ORGANIZATION	it would so far bring him to his thoughts as to allter his Tirannicol Measures ,
Espetially	PERSON	when he Considerd that what ever was Recoverd would be wholly out of his own Estate & what he should take without Law or Right , would not be of advantage to him , as his Estate at Home , -LRB- tho he Could not be Tacen here -RRB- would be Subject for the payment theirof with
Dammagis	PERSON	, I have not the Lest doubt but that the Admiral 2 Expected I should have made a demand of
Wallace	PERSON	, for his unpresedented Conduct towards me , or he would not have Desired me in so particuler a Manner as he Did on our partg to meet Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	, in the most Friendly Manner & that we Should Settle the Matter in the best Manner passable which I had Determined to do my part towards but after hearing of his Reputed threats and knowg that aney other procedure with him but Such as the Law would warrent would be in Vain ,
Theirfore	PERSON	took out the Writt as advised you , and am Really Sorry that it Could not have bin Served being Convinced in
My Own Mind	ORGANIZATION	that it would have had the Same Affect on him as
Servg	PERSON	others of his Stamp haith here tofore had & when he was once Shewn that he was not Impregnable he would have Conducted him Self in Quite a Different Manner from what he hasー Did he not threaten Fire & Devastation to the Town of
Newport	LOCATION	if they offerd to Lift their hands in favr .

		of the Rebbils , as he Calls them , but in Lue of this have not their bin a Number of Men Inlisted their for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	among which he well knew was a Number of his Men who had Left his Ship , why had he not fired on the Town till he had them Returnd to him , did not the People Rise & take away a Quantity of Flour which had bin purchased for him & what was the Consequence why in
Lue	PERSON	of making him -LSB- mad -RSB- was it Struck him with Such Fear and Consternation that he in
Lue	PERSON	of ordering the Ships to Fire was , I am told as Complasant to the
Sherrif	PERSON	when he made him Self known on the Ocation at
Romes	ORGANIZATION	3 and
Reddy	PERSON	Agreed that the Flour Should be Returnd and that his Mareens should Immediately Return onbord in Order to
Quiat the Town	LOCATION	, as to our Ingaugement to the Admiral I hartely wish You was Clear of it , but as to my Self its but of Little Consequence as I am Contious that I have not Gone Counter theirto the Incorageing the packetts to be Retacen I did & still think I had a Just Right to do so , as it was only by the arbitrary hand of
Wallace	PERSON	they were kep , Mr
Lloyd	ORGANIZATION	has Wrote me 2 or 3 Letter wherein he Said that the Admiral was supprised that the packetts was not Deliverd up , I could not Expect to Act Such a part with
Wallace	PERSON	after hearing from
Saml Starbuck &	ORGANIZATION	others of the threats from him & his Officers concerng me , as would by
Aney	PERSON	Means Influence him to suffer my Vessills to pass unmolested when he was stoping Every other persons property without Distingtion , Therefore I was in hopes by haveing Vessills Cruising off that my Vessills as well as others might be made Acquanted with the
State of the Times	ORGANIZATION	& by that Means not Run Directly into the Hands of our Imnameys You See by Genl .

		-LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB- Gauges proclimation that he makes no Distingtion of persons Acceptg Two Gentlemen , and that all others is to be Deemed Equally Guilty who Doeth not forth with Drop the American Cause Either by bareing Arms or in Any Manner what ever Contributing towards the Assistence or Supplying the provintiale Troops , by this Can it be Expected that any whose Religus principles Doeth not Shield them , Can Conduct in Such a manner as Not to be Sencurable by the Troops from home , in Case of their Success , for my part I am so Clear in opinion that the Measures now taking to
Force America	LOCATION	are
Rong	PERSON	that its out of my power to Restrain my Self from wishing Success to the Countery in which I was Born , and alltho the Measures persuing are not agreeable to My Advice to our Assembly Soone after I Came hoome , which I am now more than then if possible Convinced would have bin Infinitely better than to have fought it out , I Can not Rest a Quiet Spectator without Feeling for my own
& Neighbours Interest & am Really	ORGANIZATION	of the Opinion that our Navigation Will not be in so Great Danger if we Indevour to prevent the Crusing of the packetts to take them & keep
Vessills	PERSON	of our own out to advise them how to
Steere Clear	PERSON	as it otherwise would be , but as to the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	having orderd Two Vessills to be Imployd in that
Service	ORGANIZATION	, I hope I shall give you no further uneseyness on this head Tho I supose you ' l agree that it would be Right in Me to Git advice if possible to my Vessills as they Come in to keep out of the hands of the men of warr , but this will be Very Difficult as Long as they have Armed Vessills Crussing for them and Indeed I cant Expect persons to be off
Lukg	PERSON	.

		Out for our Vessills as they Come in , with out being able to Defend them Selves if Attacked by the Packett armed by the Men of warr , I am Very Sorry the writ Should have prevented Your doing our Mutual Friend
Jno Waterman	PERSON	all the Service in Your power , but weither aney thing You Could have
Said	PERSON	to so Savage a person as
Wallace	PERSON	would have bin of Advantage to
Waterman	PERSON	I Cant Say , but by his brute !

		beheaver with the Friends onbord Capt Durfeys Sloop in Detaining them So long onbord , Your Applycation would have
bin Fruteless	PERSON	, Thus much I can tell You that Capt Waterman Sent me his particuler thanks by
Cozen Jams Brown	PERSON	on Acct of the packets being Retacon , She being the Same that tuke him & brot him in to the Man of
Warr	PERSON	.

		I am of the opinion that
Wallace	PERSON	will Let
Waterman Leave the Fleet	ORGANIZATION	as he passes by
Nantuckett	PERSON	& this on acct of the Advertisement in the paper of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	< 1 ; dvising no provitions to be Supplyd to the Island of
Nantuckett	LOCATION	only from the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, Suppose you have heard of
Wallace Ayscough	PERSON	& the Tenders all going out of
Newport	LOCATION	the day before Yesterday with Several prizes .

		I am shure I never ought to forgit Your Friendship & Goodness in what you did for my Redemtion and am So much Obloiged & Indebted to You therefor , that perhaps I may never have it in my power to Discharge the Least part of said Debt , & I assure You it Gives me pain that You Should Suppose that Either your Carrector or
Fortin	PERSON	may in the Least Suffer on my Acct as to
Ransomes	ORGANIZATION	in warr
Times	ORGANIZATION	I am apt to think they are of a Different Nature by Law from an obligation given in my Scituation when onbord the Man of

SAMUEL STRINGER	PERSON	, CHAIRMAN OF THE
ALBANY COMMITTEE	ORGANIZATION	, TO THE
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	CONGRESS 1 -LRB- Copy -RRB-
Albany Comee	ORGANIZATION	Chamber June 21st 1775 Gent .

		Mr
Dirick Swart	PERSON	a member of this Board , who is just returned from
Crown-Point	LOCATION	, brings the following intelligence ; that one Mr Hay who lives about 40 miles up
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	came down to Crown-Point , who told
Colo -LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	and others that he had been to
Montreal	LOCATION	for some flour , that Governor
-LSB- Guy -RSB- Carleton	PERSON	had him Seized , and Confined for several days ; that by the interposition of the English Merchants of that place he received
Liberty	ORGANIZATION	to return Home , & that the Merchants who procured him the pass from the Lieutenant Governor desired him to go down to Crown-point and
Ticonderoga	PERSON	with all Speed , and to Communicate to the Commander of those Fortresses that the French
Caughnewagie Indians	ORGANIZATION	had taken up the Hatchet , but that they refused to go out upon any Scouts untill nine of their men who were then out returned ; and that Governor
Carleton	PERSON	was giving them presents daily .

		We are very sorry to inform you that from a number of Corroborating Circumstances , we have but too much Reason to believe the above Information to be true , and more Especially as the Troops which Amounts to about Six hundred men , Suffer no persons coming up the
Lake	LOCATION	to pass
St John	ORGANIZATION	's if they can avoid it , where they are building Floating Batteries and Boats ; Mr
Swart	PERSON	also acquaints us , that Mr
Hay	PERSON	said , that Governor
Carleton	PERSON	had asked the English Merchants to take up Arms against the
Yankees	ORGANIZATION	to make use of his own phrasiology , that the Merchants refused , upon which he told them that he would set the Town on fire ; which the
Merchants	ORGANIZATION	said he was welcome to do , and added they could carry as much fire as himself .

		Mr
Hay	PERSON	also desired Mr
Swart	PERSON	if he should happen to meet Mr Price , he should requet him not to proceed , as the English Merchts in
Canada	LOCATION	, conceived it unsafe for him .

		The forces above are in no proper
State of Defence	ORGANIZATION	, principally owing to the scarcity of Powder , of which Article we have not yet been able to send up more , with the Supply we have received from New-York , than three hundred and fifty pounds ; wch quantity is altogether insufficient to answer the purpose intended , and of little Service in Case of an Attack ー We can further inform you this City is not half supplied ; nor have the frontier Inhabitants either powder or Arms ; for which Applications have been made , and daily are making to us ; and as we have no prospect of any further supply from New-York , we beg to be assisted if possible from
Lower Governments	LOCATION	with all the Dispatch possible .

		We should also desire that the
Command	ORGANIZATION	at the Forts , might be settled
Colo -LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Hinman	PERSON	we understood would have taken the Command , but by his appointment , from Governor
-LSB- Jonathan -RSB- Trumbul	PERSON	, his Orders are only to Reinforce the Garrisons and
Command	ORGANIZATION	his Regiment ; upon which
Colo Arnold	PERSON	refused to resign ; We therefore Conceive it highly necessary that a Matter of such Importance should be sett ` led with all Speed .

		The above we are abo informed by Mr
Swart	PERSON	, who was present and heard each read the others Instructions we thought it our indispensible Duty to acquaint you of these matters , and therefore send them you P. Express .

		We understand that you have desird our Select Men to send the

		soon have been replaced ー We have likewise furnished our Men who have joined the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and three large Parties , who were Volunteers on the several Alarms that have been made , with Cartridges sufficient for their Purpose ; a considerable part whereof were never return 'd : by these Means , our Stock is so much reduc 'd as to occasion us great Uneasiness ; inasmuch as it must prevent our executing some Plans , We had meditated for the public good : besides , many of our Inhabitants are apprehensive of Danger from Cutters & other armed
Vessells	ORGANIZATION	; the Admiral having , as it is said , given out some Threats ー We have been at considerable Expence in preparing some light Cannon for Action , and We are now about erecting a small Battery or Breast-Work with 3 or 4 heavier Cannon which can be procurd , to defend ourselves against any Attacks by Water : But all that we have yet done & are about to do , will be to no purpose unless we can have a few Barrells of Powder ready at hand We are therefore very loth to part with the little we have , unless the public Cause makes it absolutely necessary ; in which case we shall readily give up the last Ounce , the Destruction of this

PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	22 June 1775 ... In consequence of our being deprived of all Communication by Land , fresh Beef for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	can not be procured .

		Once we have had a Supply from
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, but , almost this whole Country being our Enemies from Principle , it is with the greatest difficulty any Refreshments can be got ; the few who from inclination or the Prospect of gain , are willing to supply us being very severely handled when discovered .

		Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Linzee	PERSON	in the
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	, while he was at
Tarpawlin Cove	LOCATION	, procured about One hundred and eighty Sheep and hired a Brig to bring them hither , but being five days on their passage , with a very small quantity of Hay , fifteen of them died , and we have lost several since they were landed on
Lovells Island	LOCATION	in this Harbour .

		On the 17th I received several Letters from Capt. -LSB-
Andrew -RSB- Barkley	PERSON	dated from the 5th to the 16th of June , Copies of two only and of one referred to are inclosed ; the whole Correspondence between him , Governor -LSB-
John -RSB- Wentworth	PERSON	and myself prove that all legal authority in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	is entirely at an End , and that their Necessities and the impoverished state of the Country alone prevent their taking a more active part in the Rebellion .

		They will I am sure attempt to drive away or destroy the
Scarborough	PERSON	, and I think , after planting Guns against their Governor 's house and obliging him to retreat , firing at the Men of Wars boats and preparing to destroy the Kings Ship , little can be said in their favour .

		It is impossible but a few Individuals must suffer in a general punishment , but the necessity of sending all the provisions we can to
Boston	LOCATION	is plain ; It deprives Rebels of the means to keep together , and supplies the
King 's Army	ORGANIZATION	, which in the present state of this Country must supersede all other Considerations ... Early in the morning of the 17th instant the Lively discovered several thousands of Rebels on the
Hills	LOCATION	over
Charles Town	PERSON	who had thrown up an Intrenchment the preceding Night .

		Captain -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Bishop	PERSON	instantly fired among them and upon his Alarm they were attacked from Copse Hill Battery on
Boston	LOCATION	side .

		Preparations were also immediately made to dislodge them .

		The Troops accordingly landed in the Afternoon under cover of his Majesty 's Ships Lively ,
Glasgow	LOCATION	and
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	, a Transport , a Sloop , and some Scows fitted by the General , but manned and supplied with ammunition from the Squadron .

		They attacked the Rebels and after a very obstinate defence carried their Intrenchments with great Slaughter .

		The King 's Troops are now encamped on the heights of
Charles Town	LOCATION	, and the Rebels are digging Intrenchments and erecting Works at some distance , apparently with a View to dispute every foot of Ground ... In obedience to their Lordships Commands I send the Cerberus to
England	LOCATION	with the Governor and my publick Dispatches , for which , on account of the late transactions , she has waited beyond the time first intended for her sailing ... I am & c.

Town	ORGANIZATION	from
Saco	LOCATION	, giving an account of two vessels , with Provisions from -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, under the Protection of a Tender , having arrived at that
Place	LOCATION	, in order to exchange said Provisions for Lumber ; the
Committee of that Town	ORGANIZATION	considered of the Propriety of suffering them to trade , and from Necessity were obliged to admit them ; after this they discovered great Partiality in Regard to the Persons with whom they contracted , which at once created such Uneasiness as to determine the People to seize the two Vessels , and fire the Cutter , which however they failed in ; she hove up her Anchors , and proceeded down the River , some Distance from the Town , where she again anchored ; but was soon so warmly attacked from the shore , as to be obliged to slip her Cables and push down : In her Way she boarded a small coasting Sloop , Capt.
Tobey	PERSON	, from Sandwich , and obliged him to undertake the
Pilotage	ORGANIZATION	of the Vessel out of the River ; but before getting out , they boarded a Schooner , Capt. -LSB-
Robert -RSB- Avery	PERSON	, from
Norwich	LOCATION	, and took him also on board ; in the mean
Time the People of Saco	ORGANIZATION	fitted out two armed Vessels , which pursued the Enemy , and soon after getting clear of the Land they discovered and made for each other ; the Tender did not suppose them to be armed till they approached each other , when the Master threatened to discharge a brace of Balls through Capt.
Tobey	PERSON	, unless he would swear to take up his gun in Defence of the Vessel ; who replied , that as he engaged only as a Pilot , he should refuse ; the Master then excused him , and threatened
Avery	PERSON	in like Manner , and he was obliged to comply .

		The first Volley from our armed Vessels killed poor
Avery	PERSON	, and the infernal Captain , which put the People into such Consternation that they descended into the Hold , cabin , & c. and were boarded and carried into
Saco	PERSON	; the Number of Men taken on board the Tender is not mentioned ; she had four three
Pounders	PERSON	, 12 Swivels , forty or fifty Muskets , as many Cutlasses , and a Number of Pistols .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
JOHN WENTWORTH	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 1 Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	23 June 1775 It gives me great Concern to learn by your Excellency 's Letter of the 15th the necessity you have been under to retire from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	to Castle
William	PERSON	and
Mary	PERSON	.

		The People are guilty of such frequent and violent Excesses of Behaviour it is in my opinion highly dangerous for your Excellency to trust yourself any longer among them .

		Nothing appears plainer than the
People of New Hampshire	ORGANIZATION	are determined implicitly to obey the
General Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and , as far as the Condition of their Country will allow them , to follow the Steps of this Province , which is exerting its utmost Strength to destroy all the
Kings Forces	ORGANIZATION	, and totally to abolish his
Majesty 's Authority	ORGANIZATION	within the Government .

		I thank your Excellency for the four
Pounders	ORGANIZATION	, these Guns and all others that can be got off are certainly much better in the hands of Government than in the of the Rebels .

		From the necessity of cutting off Provisions from the Rebels and of supplying the Kings Troops in
Boston	LOCATION	, your Excellency and his Majesty 's Officers and good Subjects will I fear unavoidably suffer some Inconveniencies , but Captain -LSB-
Andrew -RSB- Barkley	PERSON	will continue his good Offices .

		I really Sir had not Ships enough to spare another at
Piscataqua	LOCATION	.

		The Scarborough I hope will prove equal to all the Purposes of Government in that River at present , but I will add a Schooner as soon as possible .

		I am & c.

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO CAPTAIN
ANDREW BARKLEY	PERSON	,
H.M.S. SCARBOROUGH	LOCATION	, PISCATAQUA RIVER 1 Sir ,
Preston Boston	PERSON	23d June 1775 I have received your Letters June 5 , 10 , 13 and three dated the 16 instant , with Copies of your Correspondence with Governor -LSB-
John -RSB- Wentworth	PERSON	.

		Upon considering the whole I can draw no other Conclusion than that the
New Hampshire	LOCATION	People are as perfectly disposed for Rebellion as those of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	, and that they will endeavour by force or stratagem to drive you away or destroy you .

		The few good thinking People in
Portsmouth	LOCATION	no doubt naturally disavow such Outrages and base behaviour , and would gladly restore and support Order and legal
Authority	ORGANIZATION	, but what are their feeble Efforts opposed to a whole Province under the worst influence ?

		Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	has requested another Ship to be stationed in
Piscataqua River	LOCATION	; I know it would be of Service for the reason you have given , but I have not a Ship that I can appropriate to that
Service	ORGANIZATION	, not even a Schooner at present , and I have accordingly acquainted his Excellency that I hope the
Scarborough	PERSON	will be equal to every purpose of Government in that
River	LOCATION	, being satisfied you will do all that lies in your Power for his
Majesty 's Service	ORGANIZATION	, and to protect and accrn ; nodate Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	.

		The Letter inclosed is for
Mrs Fenton	PERSON	, I suppose wife of
Col Fenton	PERSON	, whom you mention to be in custody of the Rebels .

		I have acquainted her that you have my Leave to let the Spinkes bring her and her Family to
Boston	LOCATION	, which I desire you will do , if the Lady has not taken a passage in the Transport already .

		I can make no Alteration in my Orders for seizing and sending to
Boston	LOCATION	all Kinds of Provisions .

		On the contrary there is every reason for their being executed with the greatest Exactness ; The King 's Troops must be supplied .

		The Rebels must be distressed by all means in our Power : And altho ' I do not mean to withdraw your discretionary Power of allowing what Provision is really for the use of peaceable and good Subjects , yet surely the Town of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	hath very little pretension to Indulgence , except for obliging their Governor to move for his Safety to a dismantled Fort and unprovided with necessary Accomodations .

		His Majesty 's Servants and good Subjects should be discriminated from the Rebels and have what favor can be shewn them , but , in my opinion , they ought no longer to risque themselves in the Power of the People , without the least Security from Lawless and deliberate Acts of Cruelty and Oppression .

		Such of the Stores demanded as could be got are sent round .

		By the next Opportunity send me the State and Condition of his Majesty 's Ship under your Command .

		I am & c.

JONATHAN TRUMBULL	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Providence June 24th 1775 I received a Letter last Evening from the

Plymouth	LOCATION	informing me That Two Vessels from Genl -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	under Convoy of an armed
Cutter	ORGANIZATION	2 arrived at
Saco	LOCATION	with Provisions in Order to exchange for Lumber ; The Com through Necessity agreed to the Exchange , but a Misunderstanding arising the Inhabitants seized the two Vessels 3 and fired upon the Cutter , who was obliged to drop down the River .

		In her Way she boarded a small coasting Sloop and took the Captain of her -LRB-
Toby	PERSON	-RRB- 4 for a Pilot ; before they got out of the River they boarded a Schooner Capt.
Avery	PERSON	5 from
Norwich	LOCATION	whom they also took on board .

		In the mean Time the Inhabitants fitted out Two armed Vessels and pursued the Cutter Soon after getting clear of the Land they discovered and stood for each other .

		The Capt. of the Cutter threatened
Toby	PERSON	with a Pistol at his Breast that he would send a Brace of Balls through him unless he would swear to take up his Gun in Defence of the Vessel ; but he nobly refused .

		Poor
Avery	PERSON	threatened in the like Manner was intimidated into a Compliance .

		The First Volley from our People killed Avery & the Captain 6 of the Cutter ; upon which the Men ran into the
Hold & Cabbin	ORGANIZATION	, and the Schooner was carried into
Saco	PERSON	.

		The Number of Men she had is not mentioned .

		There were found on board 4 Three Pounders , 12 Swivels , 40 or 50 Muskets , as many Cutlasses and a Number of Pistols .

		By a Vessel which arrived here Yesterday and left New-York on Wednesday -LSB- June 21 -RSB- We have Accounts that some Transports with about 500 Troops had arrived at the Hook but found Orders there from General

		COLONEL
BENEDICT	PERSON	ARNOLD TO THE
MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	COMMITTEE 1 Gentlemen : Crown Point , June 24 , 1775 .

		Your instructions of the 14th instant from the Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
Massachusetts-Bay	LOCATION	, in regard to my conduct here , being now before me , I will answer in course .

		In the first place , I observe you are appointed to examine my conduct , and in what manner I have executed my commission .

		I look on this instruction at this juncture as unprecedented , and a very plain intimation that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are dubious of my rectitude or abilities , which is a sufficient inducement for me to decline serving them longer .

		Secondly , the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	have authorized you to judge of my spirit , capacity , and conduct , and determine whether I shall continue in commission , and if so , that I shall be under the command of a person appointed by the
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	.

		In answer to the first part , it appears to me very extraordinary that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should first appoint an officer , and afterwards , when he had executed his commission , to appoint a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to examine if he was fit for his post .

		I think the examination should have been prior to the commission , and that after executing that commission they should order a younger officer of the same rank to take the command of the fortresses , vessels , & c. , conquered , plainly indicates the loss of their confidence , and is a most disgraceful reflection on him and the body of troops he commands , which is a sufficient inducement to resign , not to mention the very great hardship on the private men , who , having served well near two months , are now to be mustered , and if , by sickness or hard labour , they are reduced and not fit for service , and of course do not pass muster , they are to lose their former time and service , and reduced to the distress of begging their bread until they can get home to their friends .

		The last objection I have to make is , that I have so far lost the confidence of the -LSB- Provincial -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that they have declined sending me money , as was promised by Captain -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Brown	PERSON	, to discharge the small and unavoidable debts I have contracted for necessaries for the use of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, for which my own credit is at stake , and I am reduced to the necessity of leaving the place with dishonour , or waiting until I can send home and discharge those debts out of my private purse .

		The latter of which I am determined to do , though I have already advanced one hundred Pounds , lawful money , out of my private purse .

		All which reasons I believe will be thought a sufficient inducement for me to decline holding my commission longer .

		I am , Gentlemen , -LSB- & c. -RSB-

VERITAS	ORGANIZATION	'' TO
JOHN HOLT	PERSON	, PRINTER OF THE
NEW YORK JOURNAL	ORGANIZATION	1 Mr.
HOLT	PERSON	, The following erroneous account of the reduction of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, was published in Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's Oracle of Liberty the 24th , May last , and as the writer of the account which follows it , had no opportunity of seeing it , till very lately , he being up at the forts , ever since they were taken , he could not contradict it sooner .

		I beg therefore you 'll republish it in your next
Journal	ORGANIZATION	, together with the account that follows it , which may be depended on .

		I am , your 's , & c. -LSB- Here is reprinted the account which appeared originally in the
New England Chronicle	LOCATION	, at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, May 18 , 1775 -RSB- As the above account of the reduction of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, which from its complexion , I suppose originated from that very modest gentleman , Col.
-LSB- James -RSB- Easton	PERSON	himself , is so replete with falshood , and is so great an imposition on the public , that I think it my duty , in order to undeceive the public , and to do justice to modest merit , to give you a candid detail of the whole matter , for the truth of which I appeal to every officer and private who were present , which is as follows : Some gentlemen arrived in the
New-Hampshire	LOCATION	grants from
Connecticut	LOCATION	, with a design of seizing on the fortress of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, were there joined by a number of men , among whom were Col.
-LSB- Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	and
Easton	PERSON	, the former , with the assistance of Captain -LSB-
Seth -RSB- Warner	PERSON	, collected about 150 men , with whom they marched to
Castletown	LOCATION	, 20 miles from
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, where they left Col.
Easton	PERSON	, and proceeded 10 miles towards
Shoreham	LOCATION	, the next day Col.
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	, arrived at
Castleton	LOCATION	, from
Cambridge	LOCATION	, having concerted in similar plan , and being commissioned by the
Massachusetts Congress	ORGANIZATION	to raise a regiment , he proceeded on to the party under the command of Colonel
Allen	PERSON	, -- when Col.
Arnold	PERSON	made known his commission , & c -- it was voted by the officers present , that he should take a joint command with Col.
Allen	PERSON	-LRB- Col.
Easton	PERSON	not presuming to take any command -RRB- -- When the party had marched to
Shoreham	LOCATION	, two miles on the
Lake	LOCATION	below
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, where they waited for batteaus to cross the
Lake	LOCATION	, until midnight , and none arriving , Col.
Arnold	PERSON	, with much difficulty , persuaded about 40 men to embark with him in a batteau accidentally taken there , and landed half a mile from the fort , and immediately sent back the batteau , which by reason of a violent storm of wind and rain did not return until break of day with a small boat , and near 50 men in both , -- It was then proposed by some gentlemen to wait open day , and the arrival of the remainder of the men which amounted at that time to near 100 ; this Col.
Arnold	PERSON	strenuously opposed , and urged to storm the fort immediately , declaring he would enter it alone , if no man had courage to follow him -- this had the desired effect , he with Col.
Allen	PERSON	headed the party and proceeded directly to the fort -- when they came within about 10 yards of the gate , the centry discovered them and made a precipitate retreat , he was pursued closely by Col.
Arnold	PERSON	, who was the first person that entered the fort , and Col.
Allen	PERSON	about 5 yards behind him -- this I was an eye witness of being only a few yards distant .

		-- Col.
Arnold	PERSON	immediately order 'd the men to secure the doors of the barracks , and went himself with Col.
Allen	PERSON	to the commanding officer ,
Captain De la Place	ORGANIZATION	, and desired him to deliver up his arms , and he might expect to be treated like a gentleman , which he immediately complied with , as did the whole garrison .

		I do not recollect seeing Col.
Easton	PERSON	until 9 o'clock , and was told he was the last man that entered the fort , and that , not till the soldiers and their arms were secured , he having concealed himself in an old barrack near the redoubt , under the pretence of wiping and drying his gun , which he said had got wet in crossing the
Lake	LOCATION	.

		Since which I have often heard Col.
Easton	PERSON	, in a base and cowardly manner abuse Col.
Arnold	PERSON	behind his back , though always very complaisant before his face -- Col.
Arnold	PERSON	was soon made acquainted with the liberty he had taken with his character , and upon his refusing to give proper satisfaction , I had the pleasure of seeing him heartily kicked by
Colonel Arnold	ORGANIZATION	, to the great satisfaction of a number of gentlemen present , although he -LRB-
Easton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- was armed with a cutlass , and a pair of loaded pistols in his pocket .

Ticonderoga	LOCATION	; June 25 , 1775 Gentlemen Notwithstanding the many Calamities the Colony of the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	now struggles under , the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	there are resolutely determined to leave nothing within their power undone , which may have a probable Tendency -RSB- to preserve the rights and property of the American Colonies .

		In persuance of this resolution they on the 14th Day of June appointed a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, whereof I have the honour to be Chairman to proceed to
Tyconderoga	LOCATION	and Crown Point , to inquire into the importance of holding those posts , and among other things respectfully to signify to you their thoughts on the Subject , ー The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	have made such inquiries as they were directed to prosecute , and have ordered me to take leave to inform you that it is their opinion , should the Fortreses on
Lake Champlain Fall	LOCATION	into the hands of our Enemies the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	with the
New England Colonies	ORGANIZATION	must be in the utmost ins -LSB- ecur -RSB- ity , for the Enemy might Land -LSB- men -RSB- at the southern End of a part of the waters of

South Bay	LOCATION	from whence , as
Fort Edward	PERSON	is rased to the foundation , there is nothing to check them , or prevent their Spreading Fire and devastation down to
Albany	LOCATION	, and over all the
Frontier Towns-Eastward	ORGANIZATION	, in
New York	LOCATION	and the
New England Colonies	ORGANIZATION	wherefore , it is the opinion of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, that all possible care ought to be taken to keep the
Command of Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, which perhaps , may be more Easly Effected by armed Vessels of Various Constructions , than otherwise .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	has Established on the Lakes , in the pay of the
Massachusetts Colony	ORGANIZATION	four hundred Effective men with proper officers which are all that the distressed State of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	at present admit of : which Regiment from the peculiar embarrassment which that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	is now Labouring under must look for present Supplies of Provisions to the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		While the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	was at the posts -LSB- above -RSB- mentioned , there was a dangerous mutiny , set on Foot by some persons Employed by Col -LSB-
Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	an officer of our
Colony	ORGANIZATION	who appeard to have their own Interest more at heart than the publick good which had it not been for the Influence and well Timed Exertions of Judge -LSB-
William -RSB- Duer	PERSON	a Gentleman of the County of
Charlotte	LOCATION	in your
Colony	ORGANIZATION	and the principle officers of the
Connecticut	LOCATION	forces might have been attended with fatal Consequences As the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	suppose the

Fort	PERSON	was in no state of defence , that the Establishment of the Garrison consisting of 25 men only , is reduced by desertion to less than half that number , and that it is also destitute of powder , & in no condition to afford a sure protection to the valuable Artillery belonging to His Majesty in the said place in case of an attempt upon it , and desired the sentiments of the Council , on the expediency of his taking any measure for putting the
Fort	LOCATION	in a state of defence , by furnishing it with Ammunition , and raising men to strengthen the Garrison , observing at the same time that there are no funds allotted in this Country for such exigencies , nor any other resource that he knew , but to make application if the
Council	ORGANIZATION	should advise such charge to be incurred , for money to defray the same to General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, Commander in Chief of His Majesty 's Forces in
America	LOCATION	, or to the
Lords Commissrs of his Majesty 's Treasury	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the unanimous opinion of the Council , that His Excellency apply to General
Gage	PERSON	or to the Lords of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	for Money to defray the expences of repairing the Fort , and raising and maintaining a Garrison for its defence , the same being necessary for the protection and security of the Commerce of this River .

		LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LRB- No 28 -RRB-
Fowey	LOCATION	in
York River	LOCATION	25th June 1775 My Lord My last letters Numbers 26 and 27 contain Accounts of the principal occurrences in the Commotions raised on the pretence of my having removed the Gun Powder .

		After the attempt made upon the Receiver General nothing material was undertaken , except by abusive publications in the News papers to raise , to the utmost pitch of extravagance , the prejudices and intemperance of the approaching
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, which , in effect , began without any Symptoms of a disposition to disapprove of the violences committed or even to discourage their further progress ... It happened likewise a day or two after the meeting of the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	that two Men were wounded .

		in attempting in the Night to rob the Magazine of Arms , by the discharge of a Musket loaded with large Shot , which had been placed by the keeper in a window in such a manner that any person , forcing thro ' it , would fire the Gun against himself ; The Crime in this Affair was entirely overlooked , but the punishment inflicted , by the hands of the Criminals on themselves irritated very much ; and the Cry among the People was for Vengeance .

		Among the first proceedings of the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	was the appointing a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to examine into the State of the Magazine ; and the day after the two men were wounded , about Noon a Number of Persons from the Town and Country forced into it , and , in presence of Several of the Burgesses , took out the remainder of about 400 Stand of Arms , part of which had been before , at different times , Carried off by the People that found means of Secretly getting in thro ' the windows ; and a Considerable quantity of different Stores were likewise taken away .

		The above mentioned
Committee	ORGANIZATION	then made a great merit of having , as they informed me , interposed and endeavoured , though without effect , to prevail on the People to return the Arms , but without applying for my orders or Consent , they Seized this pretence for appointing a Military Guard to
Mount	LOCATION	upon the Magazine , who have been Continued ever Since by the Same , on no better
Authority	ORGANIZATION	; and the
Command of Militia	ORGANIZATION	, as well as the
Custody of Magazines	ORGANIZATION	and publick Stores of Arms and Ammunition is thus entirely wrested out of the hands of the Governor .

		A feigned report was Spread that a party of Men were again Marching from His Majesty 's Ship to my assistance ; which occasioned an affected allarm and gave pretence for their Armed Men to assemble , who have not hesitated to declare their intention of attacking the
Kings Forces	ORGANIZATION	, if they landed , from the Ship .

		These disorders promising little Success in the great business which had been the principal object of calling the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	; and as their cause was ascribed to the removal of the Powder , in hopes of appeasing the minds of the Members and inducing them to proceed in their deliberations I offered , by the Message herewith inclosed , to return the Powder , as soon as I should See the Magazine made Suffitiently Secure for its preservation ; but the same heated and irassible temper continued Nevertheless ; My house was kept in continual allarm , and threatned every night with an assault .

		Surrounded therefore as I was with Armed Men , in the very place of my Residence , and in the Neighbourhood who were raised in difiance of my
Authority	ORGANIZATION	, and pay no obedience to it , but assemble and Act as their will directs , nor are they to be controled even by the Power which they are intended to Support ; and Situated so far from any place where men of War can approach , the Nearest being five
Miles	PERSON	, I could not think it Safe to continue any longer in that City , but Judged it would be best , in all respects , for Carrying on His Majesty 's Service to remove to the Ship of War which is Stationed here , where I have for the present fixed my Residence , and where most probably I shall be obliged to remain untill I receive his Majesty 's Instructions ... The
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	are still Sitting , and my intention is not to give them any interruption ; a point arises , which is not easy to adjust , in regard of giving my assent to the laws passed this Session .

		The
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	have insinuated a fear of going on board Ship , least a design be formed at Carrying them to
England	LOCATION	which is what is Spread abroad as another means of inflaming ; and under the appearance of this apprehension the Speaker has two Sentinels from the Guard at his door .

		I have received some verbal Messages to desire me to return for the purpose of passing the Bills , or to receive the
House	ORGANIZATION	at
York	LOCATION	, or assent by
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, I have however Signified that I expect to be attended by the
House	ORGANIZATION	on board His Majesty 's Ship which is equally a protection for them as for me ... The Country in every part of it manifest no other disposition than for resisting the
Authority of Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Bodies of men are every where Set on foot , arming and dissipling with great diligence , and appearing in uniforms .

		His Majesty 's English Subjects , indentured Servants , are Compelled to take Arms and Submit themselves to all orders they shall receive ; Some of these have escaped to the Ship of War , the only protection they can meet with now the laws have no operation .

		Some pieces of iron ordnance left at
Hampton	LOCATION	in
James River	LOCATION	from a Man of War in the Course of last War , have been Secretly carried off and concealed , and others from places , that formerly had been batteries upon the Rivers , have been in like manner removed .

		These particulars Joined to the open violences of which your Lordship has had the most Authentick testimonies transmitted , the Addresses of the Burgesses in Answer to the plan of Accommodation , it was hoped they would adopt , and the actual Situation to which I am reduced have made me Judge it requisite to communicate -LSB- the -RSB- intelligence of them to your Lordship by the Safest and most Speedy Means , I have accordingly by application to Captain
-LSB- George -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	obtained the
Magdalen Armed Schooner Commanded	ORGANIZATION	by Lieutenant
Henry Collins	PERSON	to be dispatched on this Service ; This Gentleman has been employed upon the
Coast of America	ORGANIZATION	these Six years , and a great deal in this particular
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and he is thoroughly qualified by his abilities as well as experience to give your Lordship much usefull information ... I think it proper to Suggest to your Lordship , that it may be found Necessary to establish a regular Communication along the Coast for the purpose of Conveying intelligence from one Government to another as the Post by Land will become most probably very precarious .

		In consequence of my application to General -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	and Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	, the Otter Sloop of War has been Sent here , and orders for Sixty Men from
St Augustine	ORGANIZATION	and for the Company now in the Island of -LSB- New -RSB- Providence of His Majesty 's 14th regiment to be brought to this Colony .

		Though I can expect no great assistance from so Small a body of men against a very numerous People in Arms who have declared they will Suffer no Troops to Land , yet I am preparing Vessels to Send for them Nevertheless and I intend to keep them on board Ship , or in places on Shore difficult to be attacked and under the protection of the Men of War , always ready to reimbark ; and by being in that manner prepared to move expeditiously to any part of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, as the great Rivers here admit , I shall be able , if not to quell
Insurections	ORGANIZATION	, to keep the Country in some Awe of Government .

		.

		.

		Ever since I have removed from
Williamsburg	LOCATION	every art has been tried to induce me to put myself again in their Power , in order to which the fears which I have expressed , they say were without foundation ; however finding they could not accomplish their ends their patience exhausted and last night the 24th of June , a considerable body of men violently forced into the Governon house , bursting open a Window by which one part entered who then forced the principal door by which the rest entered , and they carried off all the Arms they could find to the number of between two and three hundred Stand , which had been always kept in the Hall of this house , and considerable Number of Muskets and other Arms my own Property ; what other depredation has been Committed I am not yet able to learn .

Cambridge	LOCATION	-RSB- 26th June 1775 Dear Sir You will doubtless before the Rect of this have heard of the bloody Engagement at
Charlestown	LOCATION	.

		For a particular Acct of it I must refer You to a Letter I last Week wrote our Friend -LSB-
Stephen -RSB- Collins	PERSON	.

		The ministerial Troops gain 'd the
Hill	LOCATION	but were victorious Losers .

		A few more such Victories & they are undone .

		I can not think our Retreat an unfortunate one .

		Such is the Situation of that
Hill	PERSON	that we could not have kept it , expos 'd to the mighty fire which our Men must have recd from the Ships & Batteries that Command the whole Eminence .

		800 Provincials bore the Assault of 2000 Regulars & twice repuls 'd them , but the Heroes were not supported , & could only retire .

		Our Men were not us 'd to
Cannon Balls	ORGANIZATION	, & they came so thick from the Ships , floating Batteries & c & c that they were discouraged advancing .

		They have since been more us 'd to them & dare encounter them .

		The
American Army	ORGANIZATION	are in great Spirits , & eager to recover their late Defeat .

		I wish we had more Discipline But Genl
Washington	LOCATION	we hear is coming , & we expect much from his Conduct & Experience .

		The
Colony Forces	ORGANIZATION	have thrown up very extensive Lines to secure Cambridge & there are four different Entrenchments in
Roxbury	LOCATION	.

		The Regular Troops can not again fight under the like Advantages they did at
Charlestown	LOCATION	.

		They have dearly paid for one Mile 's Advancement , & before they get another I much doubt if they will have Solds enough left to maintain it ... The loss of Dr -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Warren	PERSON	is irreparable , his Death is generally and greatly lamented .

		ORIGINAL LETTER OF GOVERNOR
JAMES WRIGHT	PERSON	TO ADMIRAL -LSB- SAMUEL -RSB- GRAVES 1 Sir ,
Savannah	LOCATION	in
Georgia	LOCATION	, the 27th of June 1775 .

		Some time ago I had the honour to receive a letter from the Earl of
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	, dated the 1st of February last , wherein he wrote me that an order was gone from the Admiralty to you , Sir , to send me one of your cruisers , but none is yet arrived ー nor have I heard any thing of it since .

		And I am now to acquaint you , that four or five boats , from the
South-Carolina	LOCATION	side , of our inlet , have been here for ten or twelve days past , full of armed men ー it is said near one hundred .

		We expect a vessel from
London	LOCATION	every day , with a considerable quantity of gunpowder on board and report says , that these people mean to take it out , and carry it away ; and it is not in my power to prevent it .

		And thus you see , Sir , that our port may , and in short is , blocked up by our neighbours , and that they have it in their power to plunder any thing , that arrives here , and do just what they please .

		I hope , therefore , that you will be kind enough to give such immediate assistance , as may be in your power , to prevent such insults , and attempts , as I have mentioned .

		Pardon me , Sir , for saying that an armed schooner will be of little use ; or any thing less , than a sloop of war of some force , and which , from Lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	's letter , I have been long expecting , and impatiently looking out for .

		I doubt not but the situation we are in will strike you in such a light , that you will see the propriety of immediate assistance .

		Another matter seems to be also necessary for his Majesty 's service ; viz. frequent accounts from yourself , and General
Gage	PERSON	, with respect to the state of affairs , your way ー as I find it has the greatest influence on the conduct and proceedings of the people here , And I have no way by which this can be done , unless you are pleased to send it by some of his Majesty 's vessels under your command .

		I have the honour to be , with perfect esteem , Sir , your most ob .

		and most humble serv -LSB- ant -RSB- .

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES AS SUBSTITUTED BY THE

Savannah	LOCATION	in
Georgia	LOCATION	, the 27th June , 1775 .

		Some time ago I had the honour to receive a letter from the Earl of
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	, dated the 1st February last , wherein he wrote to me , that an order was gone from the Admiralty to you , Sir , to send me one of your cruisers .

		It gives me the highest pleasure to acquaint you , that I now have not any occasion for any vessel of war , and I am clearly of opinion that his Majesty 's service will be better promoted by the absence than the presence of vessels of war in this port .

		On this subject of military forces , being at present sent to this part of the Continent , I have written fully to the General , and I beg leave to refer you , Sir , to that letter , which is of equal date with this .

		As I am persuaded it will be for the benefit of the service , that the Southern Governors should have early information of important transactions in your part of the Continent , I doubt not but that if you , Sir , shall be of the same opinion , you will send such by some advice boat .

		And if such vessel proceeds to
Charlestown	LOCATION	, my packet may there be sent on shore , and it will reach me , by a secure land conveyance by Express from the Post-Office .

		Perhaps Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Tollemache	PERSON	may give you , Sir , some little alarm about two or three canoes from
South-Carolina	LOCATION	in this river ; waiting , as report says , to take some gun powder from on board a vessel daily expected to arrive here .

		But , I acquaint you , Sir , that they are sent upon a smuggling party of goods into their own Colony , by private directions of their Committee .

		They mean to procure some gun-powder , and I shall not be displeased if under the appearance of some violence they purchase such an article ー as , it is intended to make good the contract made by Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	and myself , with the Indians , both Creeks and Cherokees ; the latter of whom will be more convenient for the Carolinians , than the people of
Georgia	LOCATION	to supply .

		I have the honour to be , with perfect esteem , Sir , your most humb and most obt servt .

JOHN THAXTER	PERSON	TO
JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Braintree	LOCATION	June 28th .

		1775 Dear Sir One of the many brave and gallant Actions that have graced our Arms , I take the Liberty of writing you an Account of .

		The most important Transactions , since your Absence , you are undoubtedly already informed of ; but as this , I am about to relate , is just come to hand , I embrace the Opportunity of sending you an Account of it by the Express .

		Not long before the Date of this , General
Gage	PERSON	dispatched two Sloops with Provision to
Machias	LOCATION	, under the Convoy of a Tender ー this Provision was to be exchanged for Lumber & other Articles .


Stephen	PERSON	and
Ichabod Jones	PERSON	the Contractors had made Application to the Town to supply the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	with Lumber ー one of the Traitors was taken Prisoner , the other fled to the -LSB- ... in -RSB- Imitation of the Colonel perhaps .

		The Contractors being made Prisoners , the Captain of the Tender threatned instant Demolition to the Town , if there was not an immediate Resignation of them and Springs were put to the Cables for that End .

		The Inhabitants , neither intimidated by the Abuses they had previously recieved from the Sloops Crews , nor the brutum Fulmen of the Captain , retained the Prisoners ー upon which a few Martial Civilities passed between both Parties ー but finding our Fire too hot , they put to Sea .

		The Machias People , determn 'd on a Capture of the Tender , boarded the Sloops , armed them with Implements of War and Husbandry , and sailed after her , and soon came up with her , when an Engagement ensued , in which our Men , as usual , proved victorious .

		The Tender had twelve Swivels it is said .

		The Captain and three Men , besides many wounded , fell on their Part , also
Robert Avery	PERSON	of
Norwich	LOCATION	a Prisoner was unfortunately killed ; two or three , with several wounded , fell on our Part .

		What Men remained on board the Tender were taken Prisoners .

		This was the tragical End of their intended Exchange .

		A few Days agone arrived at
Nantucket	LOCATION	, after seven Weeks Passage , a Vessel from
England	LOCATION	.

		One of the Passengers ,
Viz.	LOCATION	.

		Mr
William Palfray	PERSON	brought Letters from some of our Enemies in
England	LOCATION	for our Refugees ー he carried them to
Watertown	LOCATION	and they were read in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		There was one from that infamous Parricide H -LSB- utchinso -RSB- n , to his Son , wherein he says , `` he hopes the Contest will soon be settled , that he may come and spend the Remainder of his Days at
Milton	PERSON	. ''

		This Letter is secret and confidential , it is to be supposed .

		Mr.
Blowers	PERSON	and
Bliss	PERSON	write to
Leonard	PERSON	,
Taylor	PERSON	, the
Arnorys	LOCATION	and others .

		They lash us with Infatuation , Delusion and Cowardice .

		They prophecy no Resistance at all -LSB- ... -RSB- an ineffectual one , as will be crushed with the greatest Facility .

		Their P -LSB- rophecy will not ? -RSB-

		become History .

		In the same Vessel came one

		an Ensign of -LSB- ... regi -RSB- ment ー who , upon a Narrative of the Battles , utterly refused to go to
Boston	LOCATION	ー he was told , he might be exchanged for one of our Men a Prisoner in Town .

		No he would not ー he says he did not come to fight .

		At present he is at

Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, the Landing on
Lake George	LOCATION	, and the South end of said
Lake	LOCATION	, or at any other
Post	ORGANIZATION	you may have occupied .

Pioneer 's Tools	ORGANIZATION	, at every of the above mentioned Places , also of the Number of Vessels on

		As it is of the highest Importance that good Intelligence of Genl -LSB- Guy -RSB-

Time	ORGANIZATION	to Time transmit me any Intelligence you may procure .

		Take every opportunity of giving the Canadians & Indians the strongest Assurances of our friendly Sentiments towards them ; and if they should unfortunately entertained any that are unfavourable from Mr -LSB-
Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	's Excursion into their Country , try to eradicate them by Assurances that what he did , was without any Orders ; and altho I am convinced he meant to serve the
Cause of America	ORGANIZATION	by what he did , yet it may be well if the Canadians have taken Umbrage at it , to inform them that his Conduct in that Instance was disapproved of .

Kingstown	LOCATION	, June 29th , 1775 We are anxious to know the Result of your Deliberations in order to know how to conduct the affairs of the Colony , which at this time are in great confusion , the people not suffering any affairs to proceed in the usual form and to others being adopted .

		The Ships of War already stop and seize all vessels laden with Provisions , Salt , or Molasses , which very much distress the Eastern Parts .

		They have destroyed Fort Wm and
Mary	PERSON	, and have this week taken the Guns and carried them to
Boston	LOCATION	, except 8 , that were brought from
Jerry	PERSON	's Point some time ago .

		The
General Court	ORGANIZATION	met the 4th of May ー did no business ー were adjourned to the 12th Instant when the Governor laid before us Lord
North	PERSON	's famous plan of accomodation , on which nothing was or will be acted , without Direction from the American
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	now is adjourned to the 11th of July .

		Previous to the adjournment Col.
John Fenton	PERSON	-LRB- who you may remember was chosen as a member for
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	, by the King 's writ , without the consent of the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , made his appearance in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, tho ' he had for sometime before kept on Board the Man of War in the Harbour .

		The
House	ORGANIZATION	took into consideration his election , and vacated his Seat .

		The people of the town , greatly exasperated at his conduct , obliged him to Surrender , tho ' he had taken shelter in the Governor 's house ; and he has since been kept under Guard .

		The Governor and his Lady went off that evening to Capt. -LSB-
John -RSB- Cochran	PERSON	's , at the fort under the Protection of the Man-of-war ... We are greatly concerned about ammunition , as we have scarce any except what was taken out of the fort last winter , some of which we were forced to send to our Western frontiers , and some to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	before
Boston	LOCATION	.

		We hope some plan is laid for bringing it in to the
Southern Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, for
New England	LOCATION	is so guarded that t , here is but little hope of getting it in here .

Andrew -RSB- Barkley	PERSON	acquainted me in a Letter of the 27th were ordered here by You , to carry the Guns and
Military Stores	ORGANIZATION	belonging to this Fort , to
Boston	LOCATION	, for Security in case the King 's Ships should have Occasion to move from this Place , and they have been put
Onboard the Transport	ORGANIZATION	for that purpose .

		Captain
Barkley	PERSON	in A Letter he wrote to me the 9th instant proposed the Shipping of those Guns and Stores Onboard a Ship then in this
Harbour	LOCATION	, to which I gave him for Answer , that I did not at that juncture think it advisable to dismantle the Fort entirely , in the manner he proposed .

		Many Reasons indeed weighed with me against such a Step .

		His Majesty 's
Commission	ORGANIZATION	does not impower me to dismantle a Fort without the Advice of the Council , and in the naked
State	ORGANIZATION	this place is in , without any Protection , it could not be expected the
Council	ORGANIZATION	would advise to dismantle the Fort , as it must inevitably expose their Lives and Properties to the utmost danger ; ー It is moreover notorious that the minds of the unhappy deluded Country People , are more unsettled by the Propagation of false Rumors among them , than by any other means , and a movement of this nature can not fail of being turned to that use by those Leaders who make it their Study and Aim to mislead the Multitude .

		therefore applied for your affording me more Aid , and I can not help expressing my Concern , that the Guns and Stores could not be properly secured in the Fort , so that there might be no Occasion to remove them , as I am persuaded it would be more conducive to His Majesty 's Interest that they should be kept in safety here , unless there should be a necessity for them elsewhere .

		However , as it is not convenient to station another Ship here , and in such an Exigency , as the Removal of the
Scarborough	PERSON	, it appears very expedient that those Guns and Stores should be out of the Way as the Country People would otherwise take Possession of them .

		An Inventory has been taken of every Particular and is herewith inclosed -LRB- a Duplicate whereof has also been delivered to Captain
Barkley	PERSON	-RRB- 2 which I must beg leave to rely on being restored to the Fort , unless his Majesty shall be pleased to
Command	ORGANIZATION	any other disposition of them .

Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	has sent a transport under convoy of the Falcon sloop of war , and entirely dismantled this ungarrisoned Castle of all the ordinance , stores , & c. Besides the inconvenience of being crowded into this miserable house , confined for room and neither wind or water tight , I am inevitably obliged to incur some extra expence for my safety and existence even here .

		Being of necessity compelled to make some small repairs to render it habitable , and to employ six men as watches to prevent my being surprised and made prisoner .

		These , with my three servants and Mr.
Benning Wentworth	PERSON	, and Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Cochran	PERSON	are divided into three guards of four hours each ; by which means I have some security of getting on board the Scarborough .

		The six men are at the expence of Twelve dollars per month each , including their dieting , allowance of Rum , & c. ; under which expence no trusty man can possibly be had for so unpopular a service in this time of general opposition to Government .

		The repairs will not exceed fifty guineas .

		My entrusting a place of such great importance to your care at this Juncture is certainly the best proof I can give of my reliance on your Vigilance and Zeal for his Majesty 's Service , and I have not the least doubt but from your Example your Officers and Men will acquit themselves like brave and good Subjects upon the most trying occasions ; therefore , till a greater force is sent out , you must do the best you can for the preservation and Defence of the Yard ー It has given me Satisfaction to find by the Commanders of the Schooners how much Assistance you have given them .

GEORGE WOOLSEY	PERSON	TO

DUBLIN	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB-
Baltimore	PERSON	29th June 1775 -RSB- I note the last of your letter as to Polliticks I never like it for fear of my letters Miscarrying .

		however in hopes that this will go Safe , I will give you some Account now ; & perhaps you have heard the most of it Ere this Reaches you .

		the first Battle at
Lexington	LOCATION	, in which the Engs troops Made a precipate retrate & Lost 150 Men killed & Wounded .

		the Contry people lost 40 .

		odd Killed .

		the Second battle on Hog Isleand Just by
Boston	LOCATION	, the Country People drove off a Learge Quantity of Stock burned a tender & killed upwards of 100 Soldiers & Sailors however the Governer says there was but 21 killed .

		the Country had none Killed & but three Wounded .

		thre is a Report of a third Engagement Agreeable to the paper I now Inclose you , but its believed that thers no foundation for it , from Many Circumstances .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has Set long time Very privet and its not known when the -LSB- y -RSB- will brake up .

		the -LSB- y -RSB- have Agreed to pay an
Army	ORGANIZATION	of 15 thousand Men , and have for that purpose orderd two Million of Dollars , to be Made , and the Different provinces are to Sink their proportions .

		the -LSB- y -RSB- have also ordered a Regement of Men to be raised in this Province ,
Virgina	LOCATION	&
Pensylvania	LOCATION	to Carry Riffles & to Contain 800 .

		these Men you may be Assured are to pick the Officers of the Regulars off , and in my opinion the Officers have Much to fear from them , as the -LSB- y -RSB- Can hit a Man with
Certanty	PERSON	from 150 to 200 Yards .

		Besides the -LSB- y -RSB- Generally fight from Cover , and the -LSB- y -RSB- often times Cover them Selvs from sight with the the Most trifling Article the -LSB- y -RSB- meet with .

		the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has also Appointed Coln -LSB-
George	PERSON	-RSB-
Washington of Virginia	LOCATION	to be Chieff in Command of all the Country troops on the Continent he is a Cool Sensible Man , and Great Matters is promised from his Experience & Beahavour , the last Gaining him the
Love & Esteem of Every	ORGANIZATION	person that knows him , and his Experience Made him be Chose for this Great Undertaking , in Short the Matters 's become so Generall that all the provinces are Joined , and so Serious that then no telling where it will End .

		and Lord
Chatham	LOCATION	has proved to the World that he knows more than the whole Minystre put together , if there designs are good , but its Generally believed here that the Scotch party wants to Bring about a Revolution in
England	LOCATION	.

		Every day Widens the Difference between
England	LOCATION	& us , as you may be Assured Every Scirmish will Make the Country people Warmer & more Experienced .

		so you must think it will be the harder to Settle Matters ー there is three Camps at or
Near Boston of Country Soldiers	ORGANIZATION	, and the people have been so Desireous of Serveing there Country that the -LSB- y -RSB- have about 15000 Men in those Camps , and all under Strict Desiplinge and officers , and no doubt the -LSB- y -RSB- will be Every day better Soldiers and the -LSB- y -RSB- Can so
Easey Recruit	ORGANIZATION	that the -LSB- y -RSB- will all ways be a Match for the Soldiers and in the End must be Victorious Indeed so much is the Country people back Interested that the -LSB- y -RSB- are all most Wrangling to try to get Inlisted in the Regement of Riflemen which I think promises badly for the Schemes of Government I did not think I could have
Said	PERSON	so much About these Matters ー ... I Expect Every day to here of a blody Engagement at boston ... 1 .

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	, PRESIDENT OF THE
CONTINENTAL CONGRESS	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir ,
New York	LOCATION	June 30th 1775 .

		I do myself the Honour to acknowledge the Receipt of your Letter of the 28th Inst which I received late last Night ー enclosing the Resolutions of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the preceding Day , and a Copy of a Letter from the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	at
Albany	LOCATION	bearing Date 20th .

		June 1775 .

		In Obedience to the Resolutions of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, I shall without Delay repair to
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	.

		It will however be necessary previous to my Departure from hence that I should take Order to have the Variety of Articles necessary to cany into Execution the Views of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	sent after me with all Expedition .

		This will probably detain me until Monday .

		The Success of the intended Operation will evidently depend so much on Dispatch , that I am sorry I do not think myself at Liberty to move the Troops now here to
Albany	LOCATION	without the immediate Consent of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		At this Place I do not apprehend they can be wanted .

		At
Albany	LOCATION	they would greatly facilitate and expedite the Service , as well as save Expence by their Assistance in the
Transportation of Stores	ORGANIZATION	and Provisions , and by their Aid in building Boats , Carriages & c And as they must ultimately go on this Service , the Forces at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	being vastly inadequate to the Enterprize , I wish for the Sense of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	with all possible Dispatch , and therefore I send this by Express .

		On a Service of this Kind in which Success will be attended with such a Variety of important and salutary Consequences , I beg Leave to suggest that every Measure ought to be pursued that has a probable Tendency to it , and theiefore I hint that on a Service in which we shall in all Probability , be encountered by Indians , a Body of Rifle Men would be of vast Utility .

		Perhaps I might be favoured with Part , at least , of those now levying in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		I shall immediately dispatch a trusty Person , Mr
Walter Livingston	PERSON	to Govr -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Trumbull	PERSON	for the two important Articles of Money & Ammunition , neither of which can at any Rate be procured here .

		The former is so much wanted here that I am under apprehensions that the Service in general may suffer , unless the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	of this Place can have a supply speedily .

		The Appointments I recommended in mine of the 28th are now become so pressingly necessary , that I beg Leave again to recommend them to the Attention of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF
NORTH CAROLINA	LOCATION	, TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 My Lord ,
North Carolina	LOCATION	Fort
Johnston	PERSON	30th June 1775 .

		Since I had the honor of representing to your Lordship the State of this Country in my Dispatch No 33 various circumstances have occurred of which I think it my duty to give your Lordshipe the best account my information enables me to lay before you .

		On Tuesday the 23d of May a day when a set of People , calling themselves a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	met at
Newbern	PERSON	a motley mob , without any previous notice of their purpose , appeared coming towards my
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		I did not see them until they were near my door , and supposing they were the committee of whose meeting I had heard , I directed my Secretary , if they announced themselves by that name to signify my resolution not to see them , he came to me however with a message from this body , importing that they were the Inhabitants of the Town of
New Bern	LOCATION	who were come to wait upon me , and requested to be admitted to speak to me , I directed them to be shown into an Apartment below stairs , and immediately went down to them .

		Mr
Abner Nash	PERSON	, an Attorney , ard the oracle of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	appointed in that Town , whom I have before had occasion to mention to your Lordship , as a principal promoter of sedition here , came forward out of the crowd , and presenting himself before me said he had been chosen by the Inhabitants of
Newbern	PERSON	then present to signify their purpose in waiting upon me , that it was in consequence of a general alarm , the People of the place had taken that morning at my dismounting some pieces of old cannon which lay behind my house , and which had occasionally been made use of on rejoicing days ; that this circumstance had caused alarm , because the Governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	had lately deprived the People of that Colony of their Ammunition , and that the Inhabitants therefore requested , and hoped I would order the Guns to be remounted , and restored to the same order they had been in until that morning .

		Unprepared as I was My Lord , for such a visit , and filled with indignation at the absurdity and impertinence of the cause of it , assigned by Mr
Nash	PERSON	, and satisfied also that it was a mere pretext for insulting me , I replied that the visit of the inhabitants of
Newberne	LOCATION	, and the motives of it I thought very extraordinary .

		That the Guns which I had dismounted belonged to the King , and that I was duly answerable to His Majesty for any disposition I made of them , but being at the same time inclined to quiet the minds of the Inhabitants of
Newbern	PERSON	and to give them every reasonable satisfaction , I then declared to them that I had dismounted the Guns , and laid them on the ground because the carriages were entirely rotten and unserviceable and incapable of bearing the discharge of them on the King 's birthday that was at hand , and for the celebration of which I was making the usual preparation of those Guns .

		Mr
Nash	PERSON	said he was persuaded the Answer I had condescended to give would be very satisfactory to the Inhabitants of
New Bern	LOCATION	, and bowing retired with his mob .

		I must confess to your Lordship the reason I assigned for dismounting those guns , was really but one of my motives , and that I had another which I did not think fit to communicate upon that occasion .

		I had received for some weeks before repeated advices of a design concerting in the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of that Town , to seize those guns by force , and my principal object in throwing them off the carriages at the time I did it -LRB- although it was really necessary and intended for the other avowed purpose -RRB- was to make the removal of them more difficult in case of such an attempt , and to procure thereby more time to defend them , or at least to parley about them .

		A day or two after this studied insult a certain old soldier arrived at
New Bern	LOCATION	from
New York	LOCATION	, who having been instructed with the Execution of a Commission of importance in this Country , came to me and told me , after communicating his own business , and being assured of my best assistance , that he had learnt on Board the
Kings Fisher Sloop of War	ORGANIZATION	at
New York	LOCATION	, that she had Arms and
Ammunition on Board	ORGANIZATION	, intended to be sent to me by the first opportunity that offered , in consequence of an application I had made for such aids to General
Gage	PERSON	, and that Lieutenant Governor
-LSB- Cadwallader -RSB- Colden	PERSON	at
New York	LOCATION	who had received Dispatches from the General to me , which were supposed to refer to those Stores , and committed them to the
Post	ORGANIZATION	, was under the greatest anxiety for their safety , having discovered that the Committees had proceeded in some places to the extravagance of violating Letters sent by that channel .

		Upon interrogating his intelligence about the manner in which it was designed to convey the Arms and Ammunition to me , which he mentioned , I found him altogether uncertain , whether they were to be sent by a Man of War , or a Merchant 's Vessel , and that he encouraged apprehensions of the latter by observing it might happen from the mistaken opinion the People held in the Northern Provinces of the universal Loyalty and good disposition of the Inhabitants of this Colony .

		Thus My Lord I had to expect on the one hand , that my correspondence with General
Gage	PERSON	, would be at once betrayed , and to fear at the same time that the expected Stores might come in a Merchant 's Vessel to
New Bern	LOCATION	, where I had not a man to protect them , and that they must of consequence fall into the hands of the mob , which was continually watching every movement about my house , and by which possible accident all my good purposes would be defeated .

		On the other hand I was to apprehend either of those cases , would furnish reason for insult to me , and my family at least , and might probably become a pretext for seizing my person and detaining me , according to the design avowed in all the Colonies , continually of making themselves eventually Masters of the King 's Servants , among them , and the more probable ' too , as a most infamous report had lately been propagated among the People , that I had formed a design of Arming the Negroes , and proclaiming freedom to all such as should resort to the King 's Standard .

		It was therefore immediately necessary to take some measures to prevent if possible the
Military Stores	ORGANIZATION	falling into the hands of the Mob , and to obviate any ill consequences that might arise from the promulgation of my correspondence with General
Gage	PERSON	.

		Accordingly I determined after revolving the matter a moment in my mind , to relieve myself from all embarrassments that the sufferings of my family might expose me to , by sending them instantly to
New York	LOCATION	, which would at the same time furnish me with a certain unsuspected opportunity of writing to prevent any hazard of the Arms and Ammunition if they were not already sent away ; place
Mrs Martin	PERSON	and my children in safety , and leave me at liberty to pursue such measures as occasion might call for .

		This purpose I executed immediately , writing to General
Gage	PERSON	of my situation , and I set out almost at the same time for this place , where one of His Majesty 's Sloops of War is stationed , intending as well as the security of my person in all events that I could not yet expose with any possible advantage to His Majesty 's Service , as to employ the most effectual means with the assistance of Capt.
-LSB- Francis -RSB- Parry	PERSON	Commander of the Cruizer Sloop of War , to secure the Arms and Ammunition if they should be sent away before my advices , dispatched with my family , should reach
New York	LOCATION	, and lest my further precaution of posting my Secretary at
Acracock Inlet	LOCATION	, the first entrance to the Port of
New Bern	LOCATION	, to bring any Vessel that should arrive there with those stores round to the Man of War in this river should prove ineffectual .

		Accordingly on my arrival here on the 2d instant , I communicated to Capt.
Parry	PERSON	the circumstances I have here related to your Lordship , suggesting my wishes at the same time , that he could spare from his Ship a sufficient force to waylay at
Ocracock	LOCATION	the Vessel I had reason to expect with
Military Stores	ORGANIZATION	, in order to compel her in case of necessity to bring them round here to be lodged in safety on board His Majesty 's Ship under his Command .

		Captain
Parry	PERSON	to whom my Lord , I owe it in justice to say that he embraces with the utmost alacrity every occasion to promote the
King 's Service	ORGANIZATION	, instantly seeing the importance of the object of my concern , assured me of his most willing and effectual assistance and accordingly without any loss of time , detached an officer and a party of men well armed in a little schooner to secure that point . '

		Since my first intelligence I have heard nothing to be depended on relative to the Arms and Ammunition , but I am in hopes , from comparison of dates , that the letters from General
Gage	PERSON	, which caused Mr
Colden	PERSON	and myself so much anxiety , were what I have since received a few , that contained nothing more than an Account of the Affair of the 20th of April between a Detachment of the King 's Troops and the People of the neighborhood of
Boston	LOCATION	which reached me in little less time than two months after the event , and too late to operate against the infamous and false reports of that transaction which were circulated to this Distance from
Boston	LOCATION	in the space of 12 or 13 days , and had already like all first impressions taken deep root in the minds of the vulgar here universally and wrought a great change in the face of things , confirming the seditious in their evil purposes , and bringing over vast numbers of the fickle , wavering and unsteady multitude to their party .

		This was an effect to be apprehended , and it will be the same unquestionably in all future occurrences , unless a regular communication is established , by which the Accounts transmitted by the
King	ORGANIZATION	's General and Admiral of their operations may anticipate the gross and abominable forgeries of the
New England	LOCATION	People , and I have accordingly represented the expediency of it to General
Gage	PERSON	.

		... I hold my former opinion , that if my hands were strengthened with the aids I have required of General
Gage	PERSON	, I could not only maintain the sovereignty of this Province to His Majesty , with the power I could collect immediately among the Emigrants from the Highlands of
Scotland	LOCATION	, who were settled here , and imrnoveably attached to
His Majesty	PERSON	and His Government , that I am assured by the best authority I may compute at 3000 effective men , but should be able to draw together under that protection , out 01 the interior Counties of this Province , where the People are in General well affected , much attached to me , at least two thirds of the fighting men in the whole Country ; which may be computed according to my best information to exceed Thirty Thousand and with which I could effectually restore order here and in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, and hold
Virginia	LOCATION	in such awe as to prevent that Province sending any succour to the Northward , added to which such a head made here against rebellion , would draw over to it such multitudes of well affected Subjects of His Majesty from other Colonies who only want countenance to induce them to take an open part in favour of Government as would put it in my power to reduce to order and obedience every
Colony	ORGANIZATION	to the Southward of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	... As I fear the busy scene in which General
Gage	PERSON	is at this time employed , may not afford him leisure to attend minutely to objects at this distance , I should ardently wish , that the importance of my proposition above mentioned , may be taken into consideration by your Lordship , and submitted to the King , and in the case of its meeting with His Majesty 's Royal Approbation , that the supplies of arms and ammunition I have requested of General
Gage	PERSON	should be sent in a fourfold proportion to me from
England	LOCATION	immediately .

		Ten Thousand Stand of Arms at least with proper Accoutrements may be disposed in hands that would make a good use of them , and I should wish them to be accompanied with six light brass field pieces , Six Pounders with all their atterail , and good store of Ammunition , some pairs of Colours , Drums , & c. and such a supply of money as might be necessary for the support of such a force .

Charles Town June	PERSON	30th 1775 Sir I have the Honour to acquaint You that I arrived here the 17th Instant , in His Majesty 's Ship Scorpion , and according to the Orders I received from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty , I have directed Mr -LSB-
John -RSB- Tollemache	PERSON	to proceed to

		I have wrote to General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	of what great utility it would be to His Majesty 's Service if a regular and frequent Correspondence was kept up between
Boston	LOCATION	and the Southern Governments of this Continent , and how much We stood in need of a couple of Frigates , and some small Vessels on this Station ; it would be a great check to Smugling which is now carried on in the most barefaced manner , both with the Dutch and French , and would give some little countenance to the Friends of Government in this Province who can not help looking upon themselves as totally deserted .

		I also informed General
Gage	PERSON	that if the Fate of this part of His Majs Dominions depended upon my procuring an Advice Boat in this
Harbour	PERSON	, that I firmly believed I could not effect it , to so low a pass is the
Authority of Government	ORGANIZATION	reduced in this Province Sir
James Wright	PERSON	and Governor
-LSB- Josiah -RSB- Martin	PERSON	will I hope join their instances to mine on this occasion , as I believe our Situation is exactly similar , and if a small Armed Vessel could be spared to be entirely under the direction of this Government to keep open the communication with
Georgia	LOCATION	and

GEORGE BASCOME	PERSON	TO
GEORGE CLINTON	PERSON	, DELEGATE TO THE
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	CONGRESS 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Notwithstanding several Years have elapsed since I have been favored with a Line from you , yet learning that you are at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in the distinguished Caracter of a member of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, on whose Wisdom all
America	LOCATION	relies for Redress of the manifold Grievances it labors under ; and for Deliverance from the multiplied oppressions cruelly heaped on it by the Folly and Bigotry of a corrupt ministry ; I can not help doing myself the Honor of renewing an acquaintance , which , during my Stay at
New York	LOCATION	, was peculiarly dear to me ; and the Remembrance of which is too deeply impressed on my mind to be effaced by the ocean that rolls between us or by any Length of
Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		Future ages will view with admiration & applause the unparallelled Wisdom and virtue of the noble Americans while they peruse the faithful Page of the present Aera .

		Many Circumstances concur in rendering us , in
Bermuda	LOCATION	, Spectators on this critical occasion .

		Our Lands afford us Provisions scarcely sufficient for two months ' subsistence in a year and our Island is so difficult of access , but in a few places that it would be in the power of a few Cruizers to starve us were they disposed to do it tho ' the Ports of the Continent were open and free .

		Our Consequence , beside in the American system of Politics is too inconsiderable to promise any accession of weight to your measures were we publicly to interfere .

		We really wish well to your Cause ; and this is all Prudence will permit us to say .

		We are greatly alarmed , and not without sufficient Reason , at the dismal Prospect which daily opens to our view .

		Famine stares us in the Face ; and our Condition must be truly miserable if the Ports on the Continent are shut and no Permission given us to import Provisions for our Consumption .

		To obtain this our Inhabitants have chosen Deputies to apply to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in their Behalf , and our address goes by this vessel under Cover to
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	and
John Dickinson	PERSON	, Esquires .

		Our Eyes are fixed on you for Relief , and on your Deliberations will depend the Fate of near fourteen thousand Souls .

		That Humanity and universal Philanthropy which breathe through the whole of your Proceedings induces us to hope that our application will meet a favorable Reception .

		I must entreat the favor of you to patronize it .

		You will by this means confer an eternal obligation on our little Island and immortalize your own memory .

Service of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		The frequent severe Skirmishes in the Neighbourhood of
Boston	LOCATION	have so exhausted their Magazine , that an immediate Supply is absolutely necessary We entreat you to purchase all that can be bought in Town ; & to dispatch this Vessel with it for this Place as soon as possible ; Together with as much as can be spared out of the Public Stock without Danger to your own Safety Shoud there be any damaged Powder on Hand please send it also , as it may be recovered here By one of the Resolutions-enclosed to the
General Committee	ORGANIZATION	you ' l see that it is recommended to the Southern Colonies to secure all the Salt Petre that can be got as well from the Stores as from private persons , 2 which , as you have no Powder
Mills	PERSON	erected or Persons skilful in making Gun Powder , we would advise may be sent to be manufactured here ー Shoud you be able to send more than four Thousand Weight of Powder we woud wish the overplus may be sent by some other Opertunity In order to prevent Suspicion we have sent -LSB- blank -RSB- Bushells of Indian Corn in this Vessell which may be sold or exchanged for
Rice	PERSON	, in which the Casks of Powder may be concealed so , perhaps as to prevent Suspicion should she unhappily be unable to avoid being overtaken by a Cruizer The utmost Secrecy and Dispatch are absolutely necessary As large

ROBERT BEVERLY	PERSON	TO
SAMUEL ATHANES	PERSON	,
LONDON	LOCATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB-
Virginia	LOCATION	, July 1775 -RSB- I have not written to you for several Months past , except a short Letter June 4th to direct Insurance on 30 hhds Tobo on board the
Justitia	LOCATION	, Capt Kidd ー He went off with only 17 ... leaving out 14 ... wh I had given him Orders for , & wh I have now consigned to you by the Job ,
Capt Gibson	PERSON	.

		.

		.

		I have at this Time I verily believe more than 5000 Bushels of Wheat for Sale , & unfortunately for me the Complexion of our Affairs will render it totally useless , nor do I exaggerate , when I assert that the Wheat made this Year , would , if it could be sold , bring this Colony alone half a Million Sterling , a Sum however large , yet may be depended on .

		I have forseen for several Months past so small a Prospect of an Accomodation between the two Countries that I determined to apply principally to the Cultivation of
Tobo	PERSON	for the present Crop , persuaded , that , that alone will wait for a Market , & not be liable to Destruction ー How very promising , as indeed do most of the Fruits of the
Earth	LOCATION	here , wh under the Annihilation of our Trade doubly co -LSB- torn -RSB- ding ; however as the present Measures seem pretty generally approved , an Acquiescence with , & a Submission to them seem absolutely requisite ー I heartily wish they may procure Harmony , but Appearances are , I think , directly the contrary .

		I have for some Months been so bewilder 'd in my political Conjectures , that I know not what to suppose ー ... There prevailed such a general Confusion just before the Arrival of
Outram	PERSON	, with respects to the Exports being immediately stopped , that I thought it prudent to get my Tobo on board any Vessel I could meet with .

		Our publick Affairs are so far from being carried on with Certainty in these
Times of Anarchy	ORGANIZATION	, that the wisest Heads amongst us know not in what Train Things are to remain for even a Month at a Time , & therefore Prudence must be our only Guide ... The absolute Certainty there appears of our Trade being discontinued for one year more , at least , will inable the Importers to demand any Price they may think proper for any they may have on Hand by the ensuing Autumn ー From yr known Attention to the Article I flatter myself the Sales will be astonishingly high , wh may in some small Degree compensate for a temporary stagnation of it .

John Murray	PERSON	-RSB- Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, in the
Fowey	LOCATION	, and his Lady and family , on board the
Magdalen	LOCATION	, sailed from that place last Thursday morning -LSB- June 29 -RSB- .

		It is said the
Magdalen	ORGANIZATION	will proceed to
England	LOCATION	, and that the
Fowey	LOCATION	is to return to
York	PERSON	town with the Governor , after having convoyed the schooner as far as the capes .

		LORD
WILLIAM CAMPBELL	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF
SOUTH CAROLINA	LOCATION	, TO GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	1 Sir
Charles Town	PERSON	1st July 1775 I have the honour to acquaint Your Excellency of my Arrival here in His Majys Ship the Scorpion the 17th of last Month .

		As I have Orders to dispatch that Ship for
Boston	LOCATION	to join Admiral
-LSB- Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	, I could not neglect so favorable an Opportunity of conveying my Compts & best Wishes to your Excellency , & imagining that Sir
James Wright	PERSON	, & Governor
-LSB- Josiah -RSB- Martin	PERSON	would be desirous of embracing so safe an Occasion of transmitting their letters , I wrote to both ; Sir
James	PERSON	's Answer I expect every hour , & I have desired Mr -LSB-
John -RSB- Tollemache	PERSON	who commands the Scorpion , to call at
Cape Fear	LOCATION	for Governor
Martin	PERSON	's Dispatches .

		It was with equal Surprize , & concern , I found the People of this Province did not yeild to any of their Northern Brethern in the violence of their measures , & contempt of all
Legal Authority	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	had been sitting above a Fortnight before my Arrival , & had come to several Resolutions of a very daring , & dangerous nature .

		They fabricated an
Association	ORGANIZATION	absolutely treasonable , which has been signed by every one in the Province , the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	officers , & a very few others excepted ; tho I am convinced it was much against the inclination of great Numbers , who were obliged to comply , or expose their persons , & properties to all the fury of a desperate , and vindictive Mob .

		ー The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has also order 'd a Body of Troops consisting of two Re , qs of foot of 500 men each , & a Regt of Horse of 300 , to be immediately raised .

		One hundred & fifty Thousand pounds Sterling will it is thought , be necessary to carry this wise Scheme into execution , including Subsistence & ca for a year : paper money is to be issued by the
Authority	ORGANIZATION	of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to any Amount , so that the ruin of this late flourishing Province seems at no great distance .

		A few days before my Arrival they chose a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of 17 which is called the
Council of Safety	ORGANIZATION	, to whom they have delegated the most unlimited powers , & who in fact have taken the whole Government of the Province into their hands .

		ー On the 22d they adjourned , after presenting me one of the most extraordinary Addresses that ever was offer 'd to a Kings Governor , & a new
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is to be chosen in August .

		ー In this state have I found the Province of
S. Carolina	LOCATION	, & Your Excellency can hardly conceive a more distress 'd , & or embarras 'd situation than the one I am at present in .

		The Lieut Governor instead of giving his Assistance on this Emergency , has fairly abandon 'd Government , not having once appeared since my Arrival , but remains at his Country House an unconcerned Spectator of the Distractions that at present prevail in his unhappy Country .

		All these disagreeable circumstances are greatly increased by the difficulty , if not absolute impossibility of carrying on any correspondence by Land with Your Excellency , & the Admiral , to whom alone we can at present look for Protection , or Support , as well as for Authentick Information of what passes to the Northward .

		In our present forlorn situation it will be of the last consequence to His Majys Service to have a constant , & regular intercourse kept up between Your Excellency & the
Southern Provinces	LOCATION	, & very full as well as early accounts transmitted to the Governors , of every event of any moment that may happen in the
Massachusets	LOCATION	; this can only be done by Sea , I therefore have requested both Sir
James Wright	PERSON	, & Governor
Martin	PERSON	to join in my application to Admiral
Graves	PERSON	, & I flatter myself we shall have your Concurrence .

		ー As we have reason to think the Admiral as well as Your Excellency is by this time strongly reinforced from
England	LOCATION	, we may hope this part of the Continent will at last be thought of .

		Two Regts in this Town , & a couple of Frigates in the harbour , would certainly have prevented much mischief both here , & in
Georgia	LOCATION	: I fear it is now too late for a small body of troops to be of much service could they even be spared , but at all events the Frigates with some small vessels to scour the Coast would be of the -LSB- greatest -RSB- use ; they would check Smuggling , which is now carrie -LSB- d on -RSB- to a great extent in the most barefaced manner , as I am informed , & at the same time the appearance of a force would give some countenance to the friends of Government , who really look upon themselves as absolutely abandon 'd Did the Fate of this part of His Majys Dominions entirely depend upon my employing a Advice Boat , I assure your Excellency I do not beleive I could possibly procure one in
Charles Town Harbour	LOCATION	, so absolutely are we under the command of Councils , & Committees.ー Lady
William	PERSON	joins me in best Compts to Your Excellency &
Mrs Gage	PERSON	.

		I have the Honor to be with the most profound Regard , & Esteem , Sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB-
William Campbell N. B. Mr -LSB- John -RSB- Stuart	PERSON	the Superintendent for the
Southern District	LOCATION	, having fallen under the displeasure of our present Governors by his attention to Your Excellency 's directions with regard to the Indians in their Allegiance , has been obliged to quit
Georgia	LOCATION	& take refuge in -LSB- St. -RSB- Augustine.ー I beg to recommend to the Care of your Excellency a Packet for Lord Dartmouth.ー I was just going to Seal up this when I recd a message from
Mrs Stuart	ORGANIZATION	wife to the Superintendent that a Mr
W. Henry Drayton	PERSON	from the
Committee & Council of Safety	ORGANIZATION	had obliged her to give up some dispatches of a public Nature She had recd since the Departure of her husband to such a height are we arriv 'd here , & to crown the whole they have Seized 26 Packets directed on His Majys Service that had come by the Packet Boat just arrived for Lt Govr
Ball Sir Jas Wright Govr Martin & Lt Govr Moultrie	ORGANIZATION	.

PATRICK TONYN	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- No. 19 .

		My Lord ; The 21 .

		June .

		His Majestys Schooner Saint
John	PERSON	arrived here , last from
Savannah	LOCATION	: Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	, the Superintendent of Indian affairs , came in her .

		He was under the necessity , to take refuge here , from some intelligence he had , that mischief was designed him , by the Rebels in
Carolina	LOCATION	: He narrowly escaped , my Lord , their fury , and would have passed a very bad time , by all accounts , had he fallen into their hands .

		The day before , Mr.
Shamier	PERSON	, Controler of the Port at
Boston	LOCATION	, came here , from an Assylum , in a Merchant Vessel , likewise from
Charlestown	LOCATION	, but last from
Savannah	LOCATION	.

		The reports from
Carolina	LOCATION	, my Lord , are filled with every excess of outrage , and sedition .

		Things I fear will grow , from worse to worse , untill the wicked tumultuous spirit , gets a check , by a proper application of force ; then , it amounts almost to a certainty , if one may be allowed , to draw features , of similar resemblance , that , from the petulant characteristic of this people , they will sink as low , and be as proportionally abject , as they have been upstart and insolent I had a letter by the Schooner from Sir
James Wright	PERSON	, that , things are taking a wrong turn in
Georgia	LOCATION	: but , my Lord , I am well informed , there is a strong party in favour of the constitution , with Sr
James Wright	PERSON	which makes me hope , they will form an active force sufficient to keep down the factious , and save the province : Sir
James Wright	PERSON	desired a supply of a thousand pounds weight of Gunpowder .

		As the
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	, your Lordship is pleased to mention in your favour of the 1st Febry No .

		7 .

		which His Majesty , had been pleased to command , to be sent to this place , were not come , we have only eight hundred weight of Corn powder , after fixing a small number of Mortar Shells , Howitzer Shells , hand-granades , and some round shot for the Cannon : I could not in prudence spare , any powder from this Province in our present situation .

		I assured Sr
James	PERSON	when the stores arrived , if he then required assistance , all that was possible , and fit to be done , for His Majesty 's service , he might rely upon from me ; that the Merchants here expected a large provision of powder , any quantity of it , I would purchase for him .

		When His Majesty 's Schooner , whose station is on the
Eastern Coast	LOCATION	of this province , and the Island of
Providence	LOCATION	; left
Savannah	LOCATION	, Lieutenant
William Grant	PERSON	, the Commander , told me , he had seen , `` and had spoke to some of them '' several Carolinians in arms , who had passed over to
Savannah	LOCATION	, to support such , as were factious and deluded among the people there .

		He shew 'd me a note he had received from Sir
James Wright	PERSON	, desiring to see him before he sailed , or that , he would return soon again to
Savannah	LOCATION	.

		I expressed some surprise , that he did not communicate with Sir
James	PERSON	, before he come away ; he said it was also imagined , the Carolinians were in quest of Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	, the Superintendent , who was on board of him , that he apprehend they would attempt to burn the Ship ; I told him , such enterprise , was not so easily done , that he would always have time enough , to discover such danger ; that I did not know , of what moment it might be , to His Majesty 's Service , his seeing Sir
James Wright	PERSON	, that I had a dispatch for Sir
James	PERSON	which was of a secret nature , and desired he would take it , and deliver it to him with his own hand .

		I precautioned him , to be observing and circumspect , as he proceeded , to procure all the intelligence , he could , but not to be too soon alarmed .

		He sailed from hence the 28 .

		June , with my answer about the powder , which I was apprehensive , would be opened , if sent any other way .

		I do not now write , my Lord , from certain intelligence , but , common fame has blown it about , that the
Carolina	LOCATION	people intend to visit this province .

		I am therefore , preparing to put every thing in the best state of defence .

		I shall , my Lord , order the Engineers directly , to lay down the roads and paths , between this Place , and
Georgia	LOCATION	, with the passes through the Swamps , and defiles , as we have no map of the Province , and , the posts fit to be taken , that , I may make their advancing into the Country , as difficult as possible ; Isshall take proper care of the
Fort	LOCATION	, and do all that is possible , to make them repent of their excursion , in case it takes place , which indeed I hardly think possible , for , they will surely have enough , for the present , to engage their attentions at Home ... St Augustine 1st July .

		NARRATIVE OF

Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	and Mr.
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Hallowell	PERSON	a Commissioner of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	, on the subject of Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	's application to the Admiral in his department.ー Related by Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	who -LRB- for the purpose of getting a supply of Hay -RRB- hired
Gallop	ORGANIZATION	's
ー Island	LOCATION	, which makes part of Nantasket-road , and near where one of the King 's Ships is stationed.ー Being desirous that no part of my conduct in getting the hay from said island should be disagreable to Admiral
Graves	PERSON	, I did on the 3d .

		of July wait on him and acquainted him with what I proposed doing .

		ー on which the Admiral asked me , Who was the proprietor of the island and who I had hired it of ?

		and was inform 'd as to those particulars .

		The Admiral evaded giving me a direct answer as to the mens going , or the hay being brought from said island , but recomended to me cutting hay on
Noddle	PERSON	's - island ー Grape-island or
Thompson	PERSON	's - island .

		ー alledging that he -LRB- the Admiral -RRB- propos 'd to cut the hay on the islands about and near
Nantasket-road	LOCATION	, and that he had already occupied
Lovell	PERSON	's - island , to which I replied , that Noddles island was imediately under the guns of the Flag and other Ships of the King 's , and cou 'd be protected , and therefore more convenient for the Admiral to cut his hay there , and that an experiment had already been tried to take the hay from Grape-island , but in vain altho ' a
King	ORGANIZATION	's ship & Troops were employed to protect the men on that business ー and that the house and barn as well as the hay on
Thompson	PERSON	's - island the property of the Rev 'd Mr
Walter	PERSON	, were burnt ー but if he -LRB- the Admiral -RRB- had an inclination to cut the grass and make the hay on that island , he could send a sufficient guard , which was not in my power to do , and I was sure Mr
Walter	PERSON	wou 'd be much obliged to the Admiral if he woud direct that the hay on his island shou 'd be cut ; I also observed to the Admiral the impropriety of leaving my own property , & in getting of which there was no risque and seizing without any color of right on what belong 'd to others , the doing of which must also be attended with danger from the Rebels .

		ー Upon which the Admiral told me that he cou 'd not give an answer without consulting the General .

		ー I suppos 'd it was necessary ー and desired to know when I shou 'd have an answer , ー and was told ー on Wednesday next .

		ー I wish it sooner , because my grass wou 'd greatly suffer if not imediately cut , and so express 'd myself to the Admiral , to which he reply 'd , ー No ー No ー It will be the better for standing a little longer ー and that the day after tomorrow ー will be time enough for an answer .

WALTER SPOONER	PERSON	TO GOVERNOR
JONATHAN TRUMBULL	PERSON	1 May it Please Your Honour .


Springfield	LOCATION	3d July 1775 When the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the Colony of the
Massachusetts-Bay	LOCATION	, were informed that your Government had sent Colonel
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Hinman	PERSON	to lake
Champlain	LOCATION	, with a Thousand Men to defend the important Posts there ; it was with the deepest concern that they saw he was not commander in Chief of those Fortresses & their appendages and immediately dispatched a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	whereof I have the honour to be Chairman to let the Commander of their Forces know , that it was the Expectation of our
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that the Commander in Chief of the Conecticut Forces should be over our Officers and privates .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	was also ordered respectfully to Signify to your Honour their opinion of the Necessity of holding those Fortresses as also of the Most Expedient method to do it .

		Whereupon they proceeded , and at Crown point Let Colonel
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	know , that it was Expected he Should give up the Command of the Garisons & c to Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	, and be under him as his Chief Officer there , but he declined it and declared that he would not be Second to any man , disbanded his Forces and resigned his Commission .

		A majority of his men engaged anew under Colonel
James Easton	PERSON	, who the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	appointed under the Commander of the Forces of your Government on the Lakes , and to be regulated by your Martial Law and the
Committee Left	ORGANIZATION	the
Garisons	PERSON	and appendages in peace , with much Satisfaction commanded by Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	who they are confident is fully equal to the appointment The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	also order me to inform your Honour , that it is their opinion , that the abandoning the posts on
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	would probably prove the utter ruin of the
New England	LOCATION	governments and that they apprehend Armed Vessels Floating Batteries & c will be the surest means of Commanding the Lakes ー the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	would write your Honour more fully on this Subject , but they are convinced from the Letters you have favoured our
Congress	ORGANIZATION	with that you are fully possessed of the importance of holding those Fortreses .

		Justice compels the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to let your Honour know , that on Colonel Arnolds refusing to serve under Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	a mutiny arose amongst some of
Arnolds	ORGANIZATION	men who would not Engage anew in our Service , which seemed to be attended with dangerous Symtoms , but by the Noble Exertions of the Officers of Your Government , with those of Judge -LSB-
William -RSB- Duer	PERSON	of
Charlotte County	LOCATION	in the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, & the ample Support by them rendered to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in the most difficult Situation , it was happily quelled : the particulars of it are too tedious and disagreeable for your Honours attention while you have constantly business of the last importance before you .

		but this much the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	order me to take Leave to say that from the polite , generous , and manly disposition of Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	and the Officers in the
Conecticut Forces	ORGANIZATION	under him , we may gather the Most happy prospects of a Campaign at the Northward , replete with Honour and Interest to the Coloniesー I am in behalf of the

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	, PRESIDENT OF THE
CONTINENTAL CONGRESS	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir ,
New York	LOCATION	July 3d 1775 Your letter of saturday last with the resolution of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the same day , and copy of the military Arrangement Inclosed was delivered to me at five this Morning .

		Permitt me , Sir , to Observe that the resolution seems to be founded on a supposition that the Inhabitants in the Neighberhood of Ti -LSB- c -RSB- onderoga are a people distinct from those called Green-Mountain Boys , and that they are numerous , whereas the Fact is that most of the Inhabitants in the northeastern part of the County of
Albany	LOCATION	and In the County of
Charlotte	LOCATION	, and who reside on what are commonly called the New Hampshire Grants are distinguished by the appellation of Green mountain boys , and altho they are settled in an Extent of Country upwards of one hundred & thirty miles in length , from nearly as far south as
Albany	LOCATION	to fourty or fifty miles north of Crown point , Yet so lately has that Country began to be settle that It will be difficult -LRB- as Colo -LSB-
Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	observes -RRB- to raise five hundred men in It , altho there are more Inhabitants but necessarily occupyed in procuring Subsistence for their Families ー Such of them as assisted in the reduction of Ti -LSB- c -RSB- onderoga and afterwards Garrisoned It , are Already returned to their Respective habitations ー Hence Sir you will perceive that the troops in that Quarter can not be reinforced at any rate by more than five hundred men to be procured there , and those still to be levyed .

		From what Information I have been able to procure I Suppose that the force under Colo : -LSB-
Benjamin -RSB- Hinman	PERSON	's command does not exceed thirteen hundred men Including those that occupy Fort George , the landing at the north end of
Lake George	LOCATION	, and the post at the saw mills , and such as are necessarily employed in transporting provisions & c from
Albany	LOCATION	, which will probably reduce them to Eleven hundred and under , and if of those I leave two hundred to Garrison crown point and Ti -LSB- c -RSB- onderoga , the remainder will then Exceed General -LSB- Guy -RSB-
Charlton	PERSON	's regular troops by about three hundred men only ; a force very Inadequate barely to Attempt destroying his floating batteries , boats & vessels without hazarding the loss not only of the command of the lakes but of the Fortresses in our possession on Its Banks .

		ー These Observations I have taken the liberty to make that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by being now truly possessed of facts may make a probable guess of the Consequences that will follow an Attempt which I concieve myself not at liberty to desist from makeing without orders to the Contrary , ー I shall leave this to day and order Brigadier -LSB-
Richard -RSB- Montgomery	PERSON	to follow me assoon as possible .

		Preparations are makeing here to fortify the pass in the
Highlands	LOCATION	I had proposed that part of General -LSB-
David	PERSON	-RSB-
Woosters Corps	ORGANIZATION	should have gone on that Service .

		If
Congress Intends	ORGANIZATION	that any of them shall be employed in that way , they will please to signify It , as they can not otherwise , since the last order he moved from

		Sir

		I shoud send you Bills on the Contractors to execute this plan , or advise you to draw on them for the Amount of what you may ship to me in this way , but the Negotiation of such Bills might discover your Plan and defeat it , so that I should be glad you would advise me of some Friend of yours , and when I am made acquainted with his Name , and that Sum you shall draw for , will send to him from hence my Bills on the Contractors for the Amount you advise me of ; you will plan likewise to give the Contractors timely Notice , that they may insure their Interest if they think proper , and inform me of the Name of the Vessel and Master you engage , that I may lodge a Permit at the Lighthouse in this
Harbour	LOCATION	, for Admission to come up to the Town , and discharge her Cargo here ー Pray let the Flour you purchase be such as will keep the Summer , and let the Casks be good , well hooped , and the Heads well secured with Lining Hoops ー You will be careful to write me by a safe Conveyance , that your Letter may not fall into the Hands of the Provincials .

Boston	LOCATION	, July 4 , 1775 -RSB- I -LRB- not seeing the necessity of so long a delay -RRB- -LSB- in cutting the hay on
Gallup	ORGANIZATION	's Island -RSB- found an opportunity and the next day -LRB- being Tuesday -RRB- mentioned the affair to the General who had not the least objection to my making the hay and removing it to
Boston	LOCATION	, I thereupon immediately waited on the Admiral and related what the General had say 'd ー Yes ー Yes ー says the Admiral ー `` I supposd that he wou 'd give you leave .

		ー I had no doubt of that .

		ー Pray whose island did you say it was ? ''

		I answerd the original proprietor I believ 'd was Judge
Lynde	PERSON	formerly Chief-Justice of this province ー but Mr
Walter	PERSON	had the direction of it .

		ー On which the Admiral replied ー I suppose this Judge -LRB- as you call him -RRB- is a Rebel .

		I assured him he was not , but retired from his Office solely on account of his health & advancd age .

		The Admiral then say 'd `` Pray Sir how many acres does the island contain ? ''

		I replied ー I cou 'd not tell exactly .

		I had hired it be it more or less .

		ー I then added , That I had told the General , and wou 'd now repeat it to him , that if the King 's service required it , not only the hay but my horses and the cow that were to be fed on the hay , & myself , were ready and at his service on the shortest notice .

		To which the Admiral in a high tone replied ー `` Do n't tell me of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's service , I want the hay for my own use .

		Do You Know Sir ー that I have five horses and three cows and must have hay ? ''

		I answered `` I was very sorry it was out of my power to oblige the Admiral .

		ー It will be impossible for me to part with any of the produce of that island for I have not the least prospect of getting a stock of hay any where else -LSB- '' -RSB- ー The Admiral then sayd `` Sir Why do not you go to those islands which I have before mentioned to you . ''

		ー I replied `` that I had already assigned sufficient reasons against attempting the plan . ''

		ー This occasioned the Admiral saying `` Sir , I must have some of the hay . ''

		I replied ー `` I am exceeding sorry that it is out of my power to oblige the Admiral , there is not sufficient for my own consumption . ''

		ー Notwithstanding which the Admiral say 'd ー `` Sir I must have half the hay . ''

		On which I told him `` it was impossible .

		ー there not being sufficient for my own use . ''

		The Admiral then say 'd he wou 'd make me an offer `` That if I woud let him have half the hay he wou 'd be at half the expence to cut and make it . ''

		This I declin 'd telling him `` That the expence was no consideration with me . ''

		ー Then !

		Sir , says the Admiral `` if I ca n't have half the hay you shall not bring it off the island . ''

		ー I told him I wou 'd cut the grass and make the hay and it wou 'd be my misfortune if I cou 'd not get it up to town .

		Well Sir sayd he `` You shall not have it except I have half . ''

		ー I then reply 'd `` I did not come to make a bargain , neither did I expect any altercation on this business but came there as a gentleman meaning to conform to any orders he might have given on the water . ''

		Then the Admiral sayd `` Sir Do not I treat you like a gentleman ? ''

		ー Finding that I cou 'd not get the satisfaction I had a right to expect I left the roomー 1 .

Dartmouth	PERSON	writes thus , the Resolution of the Commons , on the 20 of Feb. was carried by a Majority of 274 to 88 , `` and indeed the great majorities which have appeared in both Houses upon every question , that has been proposed for maintaining the
Supremacy of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, is such an evidence of the general sense of the Nation upon that Subject , as must show how little ground there has been for those assurances which have been artfully held out to the Americans of support here in the dangerous conduct they have adopted & convince them that there neither can nor will be any the least relaxation from those measures which that conduct has made indispensably necessary for reducing the Colonies to a state of due obedience to the constitutional
Authority of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In another Letter his Lordship says , prescribing in what mode propositions in compliance with the Resolution of the Commons on the 20 of Feb. were to be made from
America	LOCATION	, `` provided it be at the same time unaccompanied with any declarations and unmixed with any claims which will make it impossible for the King consistent with his own Dignity , or for
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	consistent with their constitutional Rights to receive it . ''

		And , now that I am upon the Subject of Government Dispatches , I inclose to you an original letter from
Lord Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	to your Governor , in which you are very particularly mentionedー I also send you Copies of letters to
John Stuart	PERSON	, 3 who we find has taken shelter in your Town ー I think they will make him quake , and they will show that we are serious ー The Express is sent on purpose with the originals to
Stuart	PERSON	.

		ー I have directed the Express to be sure to receive any commands you may have for this place , and he will call upon -LSB- you -RSB- for that purposeー I think in my last letter I mentioned a storm at D.H. it is now as fair Weather as everー When I tell you , that being a Member of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the
General Committee the Council of Safety	ORGANIZATION	, the
Secret Committee	ORGANIZATION	ー and the
Committee of Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	, which last acts as a Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	, and that all Reports , Resolutions , Letters & other papers are penned by me in each of these Departments ; you may readily conclude that my time is not spent idly .

		For these six weeks past I have not been able , even for one day , to go out of Town ; and I am really almost jaded .

		For these reasons , for the news of the day , I beg leave to refer you to the prints I inclose , and particularly to our Circular letter ー Our former circular , which I think I sent to you , has been reprinted generally in the
Northern Colonies	LOCATION	.

		You remember my original situation with our Governor ー was it not singular that upon his first arrival , I should be nominated to pronounce an Address to him , declaring that we had taken up Arms against his Authority ?

		ー However , I pronounced and presented the address with all possible respect and Politeness ー and his Lordship attentively returned my bows as I proceeded in the business .

		In a few days after , I paid him my compliments upon his arrival ー in two days he returned the visit .

		ー I have not been able , or rather , it has not lain in -LSB- my -RSB- way till the other day to exchange even a word with Captain -LSB-
Alexander -RSB- Innis	PERSON	.

		4 People in general seem averse to him ー His carriage seems haughty , and from some late proceedings ー he seems perfectly disposed to be Viceroy over him .

Southampton	ORGANIZATION	, July 5 , 1775 .

		The committee of
East	LOCATION	and
Southampton	ORGANIZATION	, taking into their serious consideration the remote situation from Head-quarters at New-York , and much exposed to the ravages of our unnatural enemy at this day with regard to our stock in our common field at the point of Montauck ; it being remote from the inhabitants , where any number may land , and at pleasure , take away our stock , which is large ー -LRB- not less than two thousand neat cattle , and three or four thousand sheep -RRB- ー which , if taken away , would greatly distress us and give them support which we would by no means do .

		Now , considering our situation , we request your Hon. House to petition Gen -LSB-
Philip -RSB- Schuyler	PERSON	that a number of troops be stationed at Montauck ; and that the company now raising here may be a part , until a matter of more importance shall call them away .

		We are of the opinion that our inhabitants would do what in them lies , to give assistance in case any attempt should be made to take off the stock ; but the distance of the inhabitants is 18 or 20 miles , and as
Gardiner	PERSON	's island lies adjacent , and is much exposed , also
Shelter Island	LOCATION	,
Plumb Island	LOCATION	and
Oysterpond	PERSON	point , we think a number of whale boats would be proper to employ , that assistance may be given from one part to the other .

		We have a number of boats that are no use in this season that might be got for the design , if the General should think proper to order Troops to this part of the island , which we humbly petition may be done , & c. I am , Gentlemen -LSB- & c. -RSB- By order of the Committee .

Committee	ORGANIZATION	appointed to proceed to the posts of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	and Crown Point , & c. beg leave to report , that they proceeded through the new settlements , called the New-Hampshire Grants , and carefully observed the road through the same , and find that there is a good road from
Williamstown	LOCATION	to the place where the road crosseth the river called
Paulet River	LOCATION	, which is about fifteen miles from
Skenesborough	LOCATION	; from thence to the falls of
Wood Creek	LOCATION	near Major -LSB-
Philip -RSB- Skene	PERSON	's house the road is not feasible and unfit for carriages , but cattle may be drove that way very well .


Your Committee	ORGANIZATION	having taken with them the copies of the commission and instruction from the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	to Colonel
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	, and informed themselves as fully as they were able in what manner he had executed his said commission and instructions , and find that he was with Colonel
-LSB- Ethan -RSB- Allen	PERSON	and others at the time the fort was reduced , but do not find that he had any men under his command at the time of the reduction of those fortresses ; but find that he did afterwards possess himself of the sloop on the lake at
St. John	ORGANIZATION	's .

		We found the said
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	claiming the command of said sloop and a schooner , which is said to be the property of Major
Skene	PERSON	, and also all the posts and fortresses at the south end of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	and
Lake George	PERSON	, although Colonel
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Hinman	PERSON	was at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	with near a thousand men under his command at the several posts .

		Your Committee informed the said
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	of their commission , and , at his request , gave him a copy of their instructions ; upon reading of which he seemed greatly disconcerted , and declared he would not be second in command to any person whomsoever ; and after some time contemplating upon the matter , resigned his post , and gave your
Committee	ORGANIZATION	his resignation under his hand , dated the 24th of June , 1775 , which is herewith submitted , and at the same time he ordered his men to be disbanded , which , he said , was between two and three hundred .

		Your Committee not finding any men regularly under said
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	, by reason of his so disbanding them , appointed Colonel
-LSB- James -RSB- Easton	PERSON	, who was at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, to take the command , under Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	, who was the principal commanding officer at those posts of the
Connecticut	LOCATION	forces , and endeavoured to give the officers and men who had served under said
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	an opportunity to re-engage , of which numbers enlisted , and several of the officers agreed to hold their command under the new appointment .

		Your Committee having taken a critical survey of the garrison and posts of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	and Crown Point , found them in a very defenceless state ; and consulting with Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	, were of opinion , upon the whole , that it is necessary to retain in the service of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, for the present , the number of four hundred men .

		As the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	were informed , from intelligence from
Canada	LOCATION	, that preparations were making , and endeavours used to bring over the Canadians and savages to be inimical to the Colonies , your
Committee	ORGANIZATION	having found Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Noble	PERSON	at the Point , with a number of men who had been under said
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	, willing to engage in the service , we paid to said Noble one hundred Pounds to be delivered to the men as advance pay and appointed Mr.
William Satterlee	PERSON	, a worthy man , to muster them and their arms , and took Captain
Noble	PERSON	's and
Satterlee	PERSON	's receipt for the same , and their promise to apply it for that purpose , which is herewith submitted .

Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, and Colonel
Easton	PERSON	being there , they paid into his hands the sum of two hundred and eighty Pounds , to be applied for the purpose aforesaid , and took his receipt and promise so to do , and appointed Mr.
Jonas Fay	PERSON	, a respectable person , to muster the men and their arms , all except
Captain Noble 's Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		We also paid into the hands of one Remember
Baker	PERSON	, said to be a good officer , who engaged a certain number of men under Colonel
Easton	PERSON	, the sum of Twenty Pounds and took his receipt and promise to apply said money as advance pay to said men , which completes the whole of the money delivered to said
Committee	ORGANIZATION	for the purposes aforesaid .

		Your Committee have engaged to Colonel
Easton	PERSON	that the remaining part of the advance pay should be immediately sent to him .

		Your Committee found that as soon as Colonel
Arnold	PERSON	had disbanded his men , some of them became dissatisfied and mutinous , and many of them signified to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	that they had been informed that they were to be defrauded out of the pay for past services .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, in order to quiet them , engaged under their hands , in behalf of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of the
Massachusetts-Bay	LOCATION	, that as soon as the rolls should be made up and properly authenticated , they should be paid for their past services , and all those who should engage anew should have the same bounty and wages as is promised to those men who serve within said
Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		Your Committee inquired of Mr.
Henry Bleecker	PERSON	of
Albany	LOCATION	, how the men at those posts were supplied with provisions , who informed that he acted under his brother , who was a Commissioner of Supplies from New-York ; that all the men at those stations , of whatsoever
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, were supplied by him without distinction , and that he should continue so to do until otherwise directed .


Your Committee	ORGANIZATION	appointed
Timothy Edwards	PERSON	and
Samuel Brown	PERSON	, Esquires , a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to supply the men under Colonel
Easton	PERSON	's command with such necessaries as should not be supplied from
New York	LOCATION	, and appointed Captain
Elisha Phelps	PERSON	to act as Commissary under them , to deal out to the men whatsoever should be supplied by the said
Edwards	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	.

		Your Committee being of the opinion that a Major should be appointed under Colonel
Easton	PERSON	and one surgeon to the battalion , and having inquired into the disposition of the officers and men who have engaged , have appointed
John Brown	PERSON	,
Esquire	ORGANIZATION	, as Major and Mr.
Jonas Fay	PERSON	as Surgeon .

		Your Committee when they had received
Colonel Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's resignation , directed him to return to -LSB- Provincial -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and render an account of his proceedings , agreeable to their instructions , a copy of which order is herewith submitted .

		Your Committee made an examination of the military stores at those posts , a schedule whereof is herewith delivered , excepting some leaden and iron ball and old chains , which have been dug out of the ruins of Crown Point fort .

		Your Committee finding that the men at those stations had not a sufficiency of gunpowder to defend the posts , and upon a careful inquiry could not find any at
Albany	LOCATION	, have directed said
Committee of Supplies	ORGANIZATION	to supply them with two hundred weight from some of the town stocks in the
County of Berkshire	ORGANIZATION	, on the credit of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		Your Committee are of opinion that the maintaining of those posts is of the utmost importance to the security of the Colony of New-York and the New-England Colonies , which was a sufficient inducement to the Conmittee to continue in the pay of the Colony the number of men before mentioned .

		The fortress not being at present tenable , there must be a sufficient number of men to command the lake and prevent the enemy from landing .

		Your Committee are of opinion that the best security of those posts in their present state is , by armed vessels of various constructions to be kept constantly cruising on the lake , and small boats with swivel guns to act as scouts , which will effectually prevent the army from sudden surprise .

		Your Committee have , agreeable to their instructions , advised the honourable American
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the honourable Convention of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, and the Governor of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, by respectfully signifying to them their opinion of the importance of the maintaining those posts and the measures for effectuating the same .

		All which is humbly submitted .

		CAPTAIN
EDWARD MOTT	PERSON	TO GOVERNOR
JONATHAN TRUMBULL	PERSON	1 Honoured Sir :
Albany	LOCATION	, July 6 , 1775 .

		I arrived here last night , ten o'clock , from
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	; am sent express by Colonel
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Hinman	PERSON	to acquaint the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	at this place , and also the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
New York	LOCATION	, with the condition of the troops and garrisons at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, Crown Point , and
Fort George	LOCATION	; expect to set out from hence for
New York	LOCATION	tomorrow ; have not as yet waited on the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	here , but write these lines by Captain
-LSB- Aaron -RSB- Stevens	PERSON	, who will not tarry , but sets out for home this morning .

		When I arrived at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	had no command there , as Colonel
-LSB- Benedict -RSB- Arnold	PERSON	refused to let him command either of the garrisons , but had given the command of Ticonderoga to Captain -LSB-
Rufus -RSB- Henick	PERSON	, from whom Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	's men were obliged to take their orders , or were not suffered to pass to and from the garrison .

		The same day a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of three gentlemen from the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, viz : Mr.
-LSB- Walter -RSB- Spooner	PERSON	, Colonel -LSB-
Jedediah -RSB- Foster	PERSON	, and Colonel
-LSB- James -RSB- Sullivan	PERSON	, returned to
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	from
Crown Point	LOCATION	, and informed us that they had been to
Colonel Arnold	ORGANIZATION	, with orders from the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	requiring him to resign the command to Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	, and that he , with his regiment , should come under the command of said
Hinman	PERSON	; which said
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	positively refused ; on which said
Committee	ORGANIZATION	discharged
Colonel Arnold	ORGANIZATION	from their service , and desired the privilege to speak with the people who had engaged under
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	, but were refused .

		-LSB- They were -RSB- further informed that Colonel
Arnold	PERSON	and some of his people were gone on board the vessels ; that they understood they threatened to go to St.
John	PERSON	's and deliver the vessels to the Regulars , and that
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	had disbanded all his troops but those that were on board said vessels ; that they were treated very ill and threatened , and after they came away in a batteau , they were fired upon with swivel-guns and small-arms by
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's people ; and that Colonel
Arnold	PERSON	and his men had got both the vessels and were drawn off into the
Lake	LOCATION	.

		On which I desired Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	to let me , with Lieutenant -LSB-
Jeremiah -RSB- Halsey	PERSON	and Mr.
-LSB- William -RSB- Duer	PERSON	, -LRB- who was judge of the Court for the County of
Charlotte	LOCATION	, in this Colony , -RRB- with some men to row , have a batteau and proceed up the lake , and go on board the vessels .

		We obtained liberty and Colonel
Sullivan	PERSON	consented to go with us .

		We got on board the vessels about eleven o'clock in the morning , and he confined three of us on board each vessel ; men sat over us with fixed bayonets ; and so kept us till sometime in the evening , when we were dismissed and suffered to return .

		We reasoned with the people on board the vessels all the while we were there , and convinced some of them of their errour , who declared they had been deceived by Colonel
Arnold	PERSON	.

		After we returned to the fort , called on Colonel
Hinman	PERSON	, who ordered Lieutenant
Halsey	PERSON	, with twenty-five men , to return again to the vessels and get what people he could on board to join him , and bring one or both vessels to the fort , which was all settled the next day .

		Colonel
Sullivan	PERSON	was much insulted while we were on board the vessels chiefly by Mr. -LSB-
John -RSB- Brown	PERSON	, one of
Colonel Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's Captains .

		Captain
Stevens	PERSON	, who is waiting while I write these lines , will not wait longer , or you should hear more particulars .

		I expect you will have a full account from the gentlemen
Committee	ORGANIZATION	after they have laid it before their
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Captain
Elijah Babcock	PERSON	can give a full account of these matters ; he tells me he shall be at

LEWIS NICOLA	ORGANIZATION	TO
PENNSYLVANIA	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY 1 Gentlemen Having considered the state of the
River Delaware	LOCATION	since I had the pleasure of examining part of it with you yesterday , I am sorry to say any effectual defence thereof , so as to protect this city from an Insult by water , appears to me very difficult , tho ' not impossible , but fear the expence of doing it to good purpose will be thought too heavy .

		Little I apprehend can be expected from land batteries , they may occasion a trifling delay to , but can not obstruct the passage of vessels of force .

		Booms and floating batteries unprotected may soon be destroyed .

		If the force of a large vessel impelled by a favourable wind should not break the former , they might be cut by men in boats while the piers necessary to support a boom sufficient to cross the channel would afford shelter to the men employed on that service from the fire of batteries .

		From these considerations I am induced to think that the only effectual opposition that can be made to ships of force , is by ships of force .

		As the vessels to be opposed on our side are not intended to resist the storms and other casualties of the seas their construction may be considerably varied .

		They may be built so flat as to draw little water , top masts , yards and other appurtenances would be unnecessary , her stores few , this would probably put a vessel of 80 guns in such a state as to draw no more water than one of 50 equipped in the usual manner , besides the expence of half her guns might be reduced to that of so many tuns of pig iron as would ballance the other half , as guns would be required only on one side , her masts might be higher and tops larger than usual , by means of which she could command the tops and decks of enemy .

		Two vessels of such force as may be thought necessary , moored across the channel I believe would , with other defences , effectually obstruct a naval force attempting to come up the river .

		I conceive the most eligible place to station them would be just above the new
Fort	LOCATION	, because ships lying with their broad sides to them might be raked by a few guns on shore & by floating batteries placed on or behind the bank to the eastward of the channel where they could only be attacked by men in boats , and might be protected by the same means , as a number of armed shallops , boats , & c. might lie behind one of the islands ready to push out when necessary .

		In this case a boom placed a little below the two vessels would be effectually protected , besides some mortars on shore or on board boats constructed for the purpose might be usefully employed .

		It would be requisite to keep an officer and a few men constantly on board these vessels which might be augmented to numbers necessary as follows : Publick notice to be given that on a certain signal the sailors in town should repair on board 'till the crews requisite should be compleated , each sailor to receive __ p day while employed , any hurt to receive smart money , such as are disabled to receive a pension of ___ during life , the first 20 that get on board each vessel to receive a gratuity of __ p man besides his daily allowance .

		This , gentlemen , is what at present occurs to me as the most effectual means of protecting the city , which I take the liberty of submitting to your consideration , begging you will excuse any inaccuracies occasioned by the hurry in which I am obliged to write , & that you will permit me to assure you that I am with respect , Gentlemen -LSB- & c. -RSB- , July 6th , 1775 Lewis Nicola 1 .

		My Lord , I have the honor to inform your Lordship that I received your several Dispatches by the Sandwich Packet yesterday , through the hands of Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Tollemache Commander of His Majesty	PERSON	's Ship Scorpion , who has touched here on his way from
Charles Town	PERSON	to
Boston	LOCATION	, for the purpose of delivering them and giving me opportunity to communicate with General
Gage	PERSON	which I have long wished for in vain , no mode of communication by sea having been yet Established by the Admiral or General , while all intercourse with them by land is entirely cut off , by the vigilance of the Committees appointed all over the Continent , which no Messenger or letter can escape , an omission greatly to be lamented , as it may be attended with the worst consequences to His Majesty 's Service ... I can not adequately express to your Lordship the indignation I felt on hearing from Captain
Tollemache	PERSON	at the time of his delivering your Lordship 's Dispatches to me that they had been violated before they came to his hands by the Mob at
Charles Town	LOCATION	, which was certified upon the covers by Mr
Roupell	PERSON	the Deputy Post Master General there , in these words , `` Opened by the
Committee of Inspection at Charles Town	ORGANIZATION	,
G. Roupell	PERSON	... '' I have engaged Mr
Alex Schaw	PERSON	whom I have now the honor to introduce to your Lordship to charge himself with this Letter , and my Dispatch No 34 .

		This Gentlemen , I can assure your Lordship with the utmost confidence , is qualified by his intelligence , his candour and his accurate observation , during some months that he has resided in this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, to give your Lordship every information that you can desire relative to its present condition and circumstances ... nothing remained but that I should engage Captn Tollemache to stay 48 hours beyond the time he had appointed for his departure for my Dispatches and Mr.
Schaw	PERSON	's necessary preparation , which that officer most politely agreed to at my request to do , since it would in my opinion be for the advancement of His Majesty 's Service .

		He has not an hour to stay : he goes home with despatches from the Govr I am lost in confusion , this is unexpected indeed ー oh Heavens !

		Farewell `` Thank God , my brother got safe aboard the King 's ship and sailed with Capt Talmash -LSB- Tollemache -RSB- in his frigate that same afternoon for
England	LOCATION	.

		It was very fortunate he had the precaution to venture thro ' the woods under the guidance of a single Negro , for tho ' his coming up from the Sound , as well as his intended expedition were concealed with the utmost care , yet his leaving the frigate just as Capt
Talmash	PERSON	arrived had been known and raised such suspicions that the roads were guarded to watch his return and seize him .

		Of this his friend at the Sound was informed and was in the utmost distress .

		It would not however have been an easy matter to make him yield , as he had an invincible aversion to the tarpot , and as he carried a pair of pistols in each pocket , he would have tried these in the first instance ; but it is much better as it is .

		I have a letter from him after he got on board Capt Talmash . ''

		1 In your Order to me of the 17th Decr last among other things You acquainted me that Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	had represented to You , that the Province and
Customhouse Treasuries	ORGANIZATION	were in danger of being seized , upon my Arrival at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	and frequently since , I acquainted Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	and the Collector of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	that I was ready to receive Onboard , such Money or Papers , as they might think was in danger of falling into the Hands of Rebels or disaffected People , accordingly the Collector from time to time sent what Monies he had belonging to the Crown Onboard the
Scarborough	PERSON	, It was said in Town last Week that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	now sitting at
Exeter	LOCATION	had passed Resolves to remove the
Province Treasury	ORGANIZATION	from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, I acquainted Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	of such Report , and wonder 'd he had not ordered it Onboard the
Scarborough	PERSON	long before , as I imagined he meant it , as the Treasurer came under the Protection of the
Scarborough	PERSON	about a Month ago , when there was a tumult in the Town , which Treasurer then told me that he expected they would demand the Money of him every hour ; it was for that reason that he came down here for Shelter ; Accordingly A
Committee	ORGANIZATION	from the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	came to
Town	ORGANIZATION	last Saturday and demanded the said Money of the Treasurer , which was quietly delivered up to them amounting from sixteen hundred to two thousand Pounds , which they carried out of Town in great Triumph , without the least hindrance or Molestation to the Astonishment of every Person who wished well to Government , and I suppose by this time it is at their head Quarters at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		As the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	was mentioned in my Orders I thought it my duty to acquaint You of this event , every thing remains here in the same State as it did when I wrote You by the Falcon , only , I hear they have removed two of the twenty four Pounders which I mentioned to You in my last , to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and have got Carriages made for the others , but they have not as yet mounted them , nor do I believe they intend mounting them in this port .

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 7th -LSB- July 1775 -RSB- The Falcon sailed down the Harbour and anchored between
Hull Point	LOCATION	and
Pettick 's Island	LOCATION	with Orders to examine every thing that passed , to seize and destroy every Vessel or Boat belonging to the Rebels , and to send the Admiral what information he could procure of the
Whale Boats	ORGANIZATION	said to be bringing across the Neck from
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	and
Dorchester	LOCATION	to
Hingham	LOCATION	and the neighbouring Villages .

		The Admiral observing that the sharp construction and great draught of water of the men of wars boats rendered them very unfit for going up the narrow Creeks which abound in the neighbourhood of
Boston	LOCATION	, where if they took the ground and there was not room for them to turn about , it would be hardly practicable to retreat , and the crew be in danger of becoming prey to the enemy , invented a boat , of particular construction .

		This vessel was 36 feet in length and nearly 12 in width calculated to row with either end foremost , and by having the greatest draught of water amid ship and from thence gradually shallowing towards the extremeties , was by means of her curved keel admirably formed for mooring quickly forward or backward without a necessity of winding round , so in all cases to approach or make off from the shore with equal ease and speed as occasion should require ; and yet this her make facilitated even her putting about or spinning as it were upon her own center , where there was room .

		She mounted a four pounder at each end , had eight swivels upon the sides , rowed with 20 oars , carried 75 men armed and accoutred , with a weeks provisions of both kinds compleat , and yet drew but 9 or 10inches water at most , steered with an oar in a grummett ; and would outrow the fleetest of the navy barges .

		If she run aground from eagerness of pursuit or in the night , the rowers had only to face about upon their present seats or upon the next thwarts , pull in the contrary direction , and she went off in a moment .

		Each bow was secured by a mantelet of oxhides against musquetry , & the piece of ordnance there , by moving in a groove , pointed in any direction .

		This invention , equally formidable and useful for a weeks campaign in shallow Creeks , being found to answer its design , the Admiral caused a neat model to be made and sent to the Admiralty for their satisfaction .

		They further report , that Mr.
Braddock	PERSON	applied to them for leave to land the convicts and servants ; to which they replied , that they could see nothing in the proceedings of the -LSB- Continental -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	relative to convicts or servants , and therefore could give no directions with regard to their being landed ; but told him , if he chose to do it , it must be at his own risk ; on which Mr.
Braddock	PERSON	did land the said convicts and servants , when they -LRB- the deputation -RRB- came on shore , alleging in his justification , that servants had been a few days before landed at

		Sir , I eagerly embrace this Opportunity which the politeness of Lord
William Campbell	PERSON	, & , of Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Tollemache	PERSON	has afforded me to communicate with your Excellency on the Affairs of this Colony .

		My Duty to His Majesty 's Service requires me to represent to your Excellency , that the Cruizer Sloop of War is by no means a sufficient force for this Station at present , This River alone , to which there are two Entrances , in my humble Opinion , might fully employ a 20 Gun Ship besides , and the Coast of this Province , that is near three Hundred Miles in Extent , and full of little Inletts , would require I should apprehend , at least two , if not three more Armed Vessels to watch it , and effectually to prevent the introduction of War like Stores , in which I have great reason to think there have been already considerable Importations , & according to my Information , much larger Supplies are continually expected , that it will be next to impossible to intercept , unless some Cruizers are stationed upon the Coast for that purpose .

		His Majesty 's
Sloop Cruizer	PERSON	, under the Command of Captain -LSB-
Francis -RSB- Parry	PERSON	, whose Zeal , and vigilance , omits no occasion to promote and forward His Majesty 's Service , to the utmost of his power , is become my best asylum in the present time of Confusion in this Country , as in this Situation I find myself able at once to attend to the business of the Province , and to communicate with His Majesty 's Minister and Officers , which in present circumstances of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, I could not do in any place of Security that I could find in the
interior Country	ORGANIZATION	, which is the only part of this Province not yet poisoned with disaffection , and alienated from the King , and in a state of preparation to act offensively against His Majesty 's Government .

		The smallness of the Cruizer , renders me an inconvenient Guest to Captain
Parry	PERSON	, I am very sensible : and therefore I the more lament it ; while I am bound to acknowledge , his politeness Teaches me to forget every inconvenience of my own , arising from the want of better Accomodations .

		I beg your Excellency to be assured however that I do not presume from any Selfish reason , or consideration of my own convenience , to represent the necessity of a Larger Ship being Stationed here than the Cruizer .

		I can accomodate myself chearfully to any Circumstances , which the necessities of His Majesty 's Service may require me to Submit to , but the principle upon which I humbly offer my Sentiments to your Excellency , on the propriety of sending a larger Vessel here , is , that this little Fort which is to the last degree contemptible , is nevertheless a necessary Door of communication with the Country of whose internal Strength 1 hope to avail His Majesty 's Service greatly , whenever my Hands are properly Strenthened , and the safety of this place that is without a Garrison suitable to its Defence and Destitute of Powder , will depend entirely upon the aid it may receive from the King 's Ships , and which can neither be expected , or afforded , in any effectual degree , by the Cruizer , as I am sure your Excellency will admit .

		I beg leave on this occasion humbly to recommend to your Excellency 's consideration the expediency of establishing some regular , and constant Channel of intercourse with the
Southern Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, by which the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Governors might hold your Excellency , and the Commander in Chief of His Majesty 's Land Forces apprised from time to time , of all such Circumstances as it might be necessary for His Majesty 's Service , to communicate to you , and him , which they can not longer attempt by Land , since the violence that have been done to the
Post Offices	ORGANIZATION	, and Mails ー and which is not to be effected by water conveyance , as there are not Vessels , or charges allowed for such purposes by Government ー and that it will be hardly possible in these times of disaffection , to procure Vessels on any Emergency for such Service .

		The utility and necessity of such an Establishment as I have proposed to your Excellency , is the more evident to me , from the ill consequence of false Account circulated by the
People of New England	ORGANIZATION	of the affair at
Lexington	LOCATION	, anticipating many Weeks General
Gage	PERSON	's relation of that matter , to which the first false impressions , that gained over Multitudes of People to side of Rebellion , have not yet yielded in any degree .

-LSB- William -RSB- Howe	PERSON	's concerning the Articles and Alterations wanting in the floating Battery Boatsー They were fitted ashore by the Engineer 's Carpenters , under the direction of Colonel -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- James	PERSON	, and I imagine it will be more agreeable to your Excellency that these people should finish their Work and make the Alterations required ー Men shall be sent to Compleat the Complements of the three Scows ー There is no Canister Shot allowed to the fleet ー We buy Oars in

Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	to receive and give proper receipts for them to the Gunners of the King 's Ships .

		No Receipts can yet be obtained for the Stores already Issued from the

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, July 10 , 1775 Sir I arrived safely at this place on the 3d instant ; ー after a Journey attended with a good deal of Fatigue and retarded by necessary attentions to the successive Civilities which accompanied me in my whole route .

		Upon my arrival I immediately visited the several Posts occupied by our Troops , and as soon as the Weather permitted , reconnoitred those of the Enemy .

		I found the latter strongly entrenching on Bunkers Hill about a mile from
Charlestown	LOCATION	, and advanced about half a mile from the place of the last Action , with their Centries advanced about 150 Yards on this side the narrowest part of the neck leading from this place to
Charles Town	PERSON	.

		Their floating Batteries lay in
Mystick River	LOCATION	, near their
Camp	LOCATION	, and a twenty Gun Ship below the Ferry place between
Boston	LOCATION	and
Charles Town	PERSON	.

		They have also a Battery on
Copse Hill	ORGANIZATION	, on the
Boston	LOCATION	side , which much annoyed our Troops in the late Attack .

		Upon Roxbury Neck they are also deeply entrenched and strongly fortified .

		Their advanced Guard 'till last Saturday , occupied
Brown	PERSON	's Houses , about a Mile from
Roxbury Meeting House	ORGANIZATION	and twenty rods from their Lines : But at that time a party from General
Thomas	PERSON	's Camp surprized the Guard , drove them in and burnt the Houses .

		The Bulk of their
Army	ORGANIZATION	commanded by
General Howe	ORGANIZATION	, lays on Bunker 's
Hill	PERSON	, and the remainder on
Roxbury	LOCATION	neck , except the light Horse , and a few Men in the Town of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		On our side we have thrown up Intrechments on Winter and
Prospect Hills	LOCATION	, the Enemy 's
Camp	LOCATION	in full view , at the distance of little more than a mile .

		Such intermediate points , as would admit a Landing , I have since my arrival taken care to strengthen down to
Sewall	PERSON	's Farms where a strong Intrenchment has been thrown up .

		At
Roxbury	LOCATION	General
Thomas	PERSON	has thrown up a Strong Work on the Hill , about two hundred Yards above the
Meeting House	ORGANIZATION	, which with the Brokenness of the Ground and Rocks , have made the Pass very secure .

		The Troops raised in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	with a Regiment from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	occupy
Winter Hill	LOCATION	.

		A Part of those from
Connecticut	LOCATION	under General
Putnam	PERSON	are on
Prospect Hill	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Troops in this Town are entirely of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	: The remainder of the
Rhode Island Men	LOCATION	, at
Sewalls Farm	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two Regiments of
Connecticut	LOCATION	and nine of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	are at
Roxbury	LOCATION	.

		The residue of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, to the Number of about seven hundred , are posted in several small Towns along the Coasts , to prevent the depredations of the Enemy : Upon the whole I think myself authorized to say , that considering the great extent of Line and the nature of the Ground , we are as well secured , as could be expected in so short a time and under the disadvantages we labour .

		These consist in a Want of Engineers to construct proper Works and direct the Men ; a Want of Tools and sufficient Number of Men to man the Works in case of an Attack .

		You will observe by the Proceedings of the Council of War , which I have the Honor to enclose , that it is our unanimous Opinion to hold and defend these Works , as long as possible .

		The Discouragement it would give the Men and its contray Effect on the Ministerial Troops thus to abandon our Incampment in their Face , formed with so much
Labour	ORGANIZATION	and expence ; added to the certain Destruction of a considerable and valuable extent of Country , and the uncertainty of finding a place in all respects so capable of making a stand are leading reasons for this Determination .

		At the same time we are very sensible of the Difficulties which attend the Defence of Lines of so great extent , and the Dangers which may ensue from such a Division of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	... We labour under great Disadvantages for want of Tents , for tho ' they have been help 'd by a collection of Sails from the
Seaport Towns	LOCATION	, the Number is yet far short of our Necessities ... Having ordered the Commanding Officer at
Roxbury	LOCATION	to give me the earliest Intelligence of every Motion of the Enemy , by Land or Water , discoverable from the Heights of his Camp , I this instant , as I was closing my Letter received the enclosed from his Brigade Major .

		The Design of this Motion I know not ; it may be to make a Diversion somewhere along the Coast ; it may be for
New York	LOCATION	, or it may be practised as a Deception on Us .

		I thought it not improper however to mention the Matter to you : I have done the same to the Commanding Officer at
New York	LOCATION	, and I shall let it be known by the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	here , that the
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	may be communicated , as they see best , to the
Sea Coast	LOCATION	of this Government .

		I have the Honor , etc. 1 .

Hill	PERSON	, are in full view of each other , a mile distant , our advance guards much nearer , and the sentries almost near enough to converse ; at
Roxbury	LOCATION	and
Boston Neck	LOCATION	it is the same .

		Between these , we are obliged to guard several of the places at which the enemy may land .

		They have strongly fortified , or will fortify in a few days , their camps and Bunker 's Hill ; after which , and when their newly landed troops have got a little refreshed , we shall look for a visit , if they mean , as we are told they do , to come out of their lines .

		Their great command of artillery , and adequate stores of powder , give them advantages , which we have only to lament the want of .

NEWPORT MERCURY	LOCATION	, MONDAY , JULY 10 , 1775
Newport	LOCATION	, July 10 .

		Last Monday -LSB- July 3 -RSB- the two men of war on this station sail 'd to convoy two sloops bound to
Boston	LOCATION	; one of which sloops Capt.
-LSB- William -RSB- Dennis	PERSON	, was loaded with flour , & c. from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the other a whaling sloop , which arrived here a few days before , her oil having been taken out , and we hear a load of rum , sugar and melasses taken out of a number of small craft , going up the river , was put in .

		The men of war accompanied the sloops as far as they thought proper , and returned into this harbour on Tuesday night .

		Wednesday morning the King-fisher sloop of war , Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Montague	PERSON	, was tow 'd into this harbour , and immediately after coming to anchor , she was thrown upon a very rank careen , by which 't was supposed she had met with some misfortune the night before , as she was seen up the sound , and many cannon were heard in the night , and we are assured a certain Doctor in this town , went on board said ship several times from her arrival till Friday , to take care of some wounded men .

		1 Friday in the afternoon the Rose , Swan , and
King-Fisher	PERSON	went round the north end of
Connanicut	LOCATION	, that night anchored near
Dutch Island	LOCATION	, and next morning went without the Light-House ; the King-fisher , 't is supposed , is gone to
Boston	LOCATION	; the other two returned to this harbour in the afternoon .

		I am now to inform you that there is a 20 gun ship and two tenders in the Sound .

		They have begun their work , that is , to intercept the trade of our vessels .

		Yesterday they run a vessel ashore off
Seabrook	LOCATION	, which had duck , & c. on board , but -LSB- this -RSB- was hove overboard before the Barges boarded her .

		She is now south from this harbor .

		Capt.

Watch Hill	LOCATION	engage one of the sloops of war , and it appeared the brigg got the better till she lost her boom ; they then parted and the sloop got into
Newport	LOCATION	, and could but just keep above water , and was obliged to heave down immediately .

		I think it shows the necessity of a small squadron to be fitted out immediately .

Watertown	LOCATION	, July 11 , 1775 I always forgot to tell you I have seen your letter to

-LSB- Chistopher	PERSON	-RSB-
Gadsden	LOCATION	's opinion about fixing out armed vessels and setting up for a naval power .

		2 I thought it very happy to have so great an authority confirming my own sentiments , and having proposed in -LSB- Provincial -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	just such a project the beginning of the session , borrowed the letter to support it .

		But yet I have not been able to effect it .

		-LSB-
John -RSB- Pickering	PERSON	and his politics , the want of faith and ardor in
Gerry	PERSON	, & tc. , and above all the want of powder has prevented it .

		The last is an objection , though I think it would be like planting corn .

		Ten very good going sloops , from 10 to 16 guns , I am persuaded would clear our coasts .

		What would 40 such be to the Continent .

JOSIAH QUINCY	PERSON	TO
JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	, A
MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	DELEGATE IN THE
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	CONGRESS 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB-
Braintree	LOCATION	-RSB- July 11 1775 .

		Whilst we jointly mourn , the Loss of a Warren , and a Quincy , 2 who have perished in this Storm of Tyranny and oppression , that almost overwhelms our american Ship of
State	ORGANIZATION	; may that God , in whose Hands our Breath is and whose -LSB- care ? -RSB-

		are all our Ways , graciously preserve the Lives of our remaining skilfull Pilots ; and enable t , hem to steer the shattered Bark in the Harbor of Peace Liberty and Safety !

		ー So well constructed a Ship , and so richly laden ought not to become the Prize of Robbers and Pirates : ー Before that should happen , were all the Crew of my Mind , we would maintain the Conflict to the last Man : ー However , if General -LSB-
Charles -RSB- Lee	PERSON	's Judgment may be relied upon , the Ship is in no great Danger of being finally lost ; for he last year publickly gave it as his Opinion , t , hat if the americans gained the first Victory , it would prove decisive ; Whereas , their Enemies might gain several , and be , at last , defeated : ー Hitherto they have certainly failed of Success ; for , altho ' they obliged our Troops to retreat , from the
Hill	LOCATION	in
Charlestown	LOCATION	, where they were imprudently directed to begin an Intrenchment ; yet , their Valor was invincible , whilst their Ammunition lasted ; and they killed , and wounded so many of their Enemies , that a few more such Victories would certainly ruin them ー in short my Friend , had we a sufficient supply of Powder and battering Cannon , such is the Spirit and Intrepedity of our Country-men , we should very soon , and with little or no Hazard , lock up this Harbor and make both Seamen and Soldiers our prisoners at Discretion .

		My Head has been teeming with Projects of this kind ever since you left
US	LOCATION	; and had one of them been timely seconded by the Comtee of Safety , we should -LRB- I believe -RRB- happily have saved the further Effusion of human Blood.ー You know , my Situation gives me an Oppy .

		to see , and observe every thing that passes up and down the Harbor : ー About a Week or 10 Days after the Battle at
Lexington	LOCATION	, I was informed that a large Transport was ordered to take , on board from the Castle a 1000 or 1200 bars .

		of Powder , and 20 or 30 Pieces of brass Cannon 24 & 42 pounders ; with which She fell down between the Castle and Spectacle Isln .

		and there anchored under the Protection of a 70 gun Ship : A few Days afterwards the Man of war was ordered to Sail for
New York	LOCATION	, upon which I informed the Comtee .

		of safety of the Situation & Circumstances of this Store Ship & her Cargo ; that now was the time to secure a sufficient Supply of Powder & heavy Cannon , by seizing the Ship as soon as the
Asia	LOCATION	left her : ー They seemed to be sensible of the importance of the Object ; but such a complicated Body was too slow in its Motion to improve the lucky Minutes and catch such an inestimable Prize : for about a Week after the
Asia	LOCATION	sailed , and the very morning of the Day that the late worthy Dr.
Warren	PERSON	, at the Head of a sub Comtee .

		came to take a View of the Transport , and determine upon the Mode of Surprizing Her , another 70 Gun Ship anchored just by her : ー The letting such a favorable Oppo .

		slip unimproved , verifys a very just tho ' trite observation that the military Department ought always to be under one Direction ; and I devotedly pray , for my dear Country 's sake , we may have no further Proofs of it .

		The Inconveniences , not to say Distresses , in Consequence of a total stop to our Navigation , will , I fear , soon become insupportable , unless an adiquate Remedy can be found : ー Permit me -LRB- with Freedom -RRB- to communicate my Thoughts to you upon the Subject .

		I am unable to conceive , any Method so likely to secure our Navigation -LRB- Coast wise -RRB- as Row Gallies : They are calculated to go in shoal Water , and navigated with many Men , are armed with Swivels , and one large battering Cannon in the Bow of each : By this they can keep off any Vessel of one Tier of Guns : ー One such Vessel -LRB- I apprehend -RRB- might securely convoy 10 or a Dozn .

		provision Vessels , from Harbor to
Harbor	LOCATION	, in the summer Season .

		As the whole Continent is so firmly united , why might not a Number of Vessels of War be fitted out , & judiciously stationed , so , as to intercept & prevent any Supplies going to our Enemies ; and consequently , unless they can make an Impression Inland they must leave the Country or starve .

		Floating Batteries is another Mode of anoying our Enemies which -LRB- I apprehend -RRB- might be successfully carried into Execution : ー I have in general a clear Idea of their Construction , and intend , if I can procure a
Workman	LOCATION	, to form a Model of one , but every Scheme of this Nature depends upon a full supply of Ammunition and heavy Cannon ; which I hope the Wisdom of the Continent will soon be able to provide .

		Our Enemies -LRB- since the Action at
Charlestown	LOCATION	-RRB- are quite silent , save , now and then , a Carcase , or a 24 pounder : Whether , they have recd .

		some disagreeable News , or their repeated Losses have discouraged them ; or they are preparing to give us a direful Blast , is , at present , problematical ; however , this is certain , they are diabolically oppressive , & cruel to those they have in their Power : ー Poor young Master -LSB-
James -RSB- Lovel	PERSON	, -LRB- if not already -RRB- will probably soon fall a Victim , to their insatiable Thirst for Blood , on Accot .

		of the Contents of some Lrs .

		from him , which were found in Dr.
Warren	PERSON	's Packets , & which , they say , contain Matters of a treasonable Nature .

		I have only Room to add , my respectfull Regards to good Dr. F -LSB- rankli -RSB- n , and to your worthy Brethern , the Delegates from this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	; which please to make acceptable to them , and believe me to be , -LSB- & c. -RSB- an Old Friend 1 .

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	, PRESIDENT OF THE
CONTINENTAL CONGRESS	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir ,
Albany	LOCATION	July 11th 1775 .

		I have the Honour to advise you that I arrived here on Sunday -LSB- July 9 -RSB- at Noon , since which Time I have been closely employed in the Duties of my office .

		It is with Pleasure I remark that Intelligence from various Quarters indicates a friendly Disposition in the Indians towards us .

		No Efforts however are wanting on the Part of our Enemies to change these Sentiments in the Savages to
Resntment & Hostility	ORGANIZATION	, an Evil highly incumbent on me to guard against , and of which the Come of this Place have so just a Sense that they pay it the closest Attention ; whilst they look up to that respectable Body which represents the Continent of
America	LOCATION	for the Line of their future Conduct in this delicate & important Matter .

		The unhappy Controversy which has subsisted between the officers at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	relative to the Command has , I am informed thrown every Thing into vast Confusion .

		Troops have been dismissed ー others refuse to serve , if this or that Man commands ー the Sloop is without either Captain or Pilot , both of which are dismissed , or come away .

		2 I shall hurry up there much sooner than the necessary Preparations here would otherwise admit , that I may attempt to introduce some Kind of Order & Discipline among them .

		I am this Moment favoured with a Letter from Col.
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Hinman	PERSON	and sundry Returns , Copies of which I enclose .

		You will perceive by the Return No 1 that on the 7th Inst .

		they had only one Barrel -LSB- of -RSB- Flour at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, twenty at
Crown Point	LOCATION	, and twenty at
Fort George	LOCATION	.

		By Number 2 & 3 it appears that about four Hundred and seventy seven Barrels of Flour , have been sent up amounting to about ninety five Thousand four Hundred Rations , and that about twenty Thousand remain , seventy five Thousand are expended .

		From the same Return it appears that about sixty five Thousand Rations of Pork have been also expended , exclusive of thirty five fat Oxen .

		Hence a very considerable Waste or Embezzlement has taken Place .

		Permit me here , Sir , to urge the Necessity of of the Appointment I recommended , in my Letter of the 28th June as indispensably Necessary , to carry on the Service with Propriety & economy , and Certainty ; to which I must add another , that of Muster Masters & Deputies , without which such a scene of Confusion & Controversy must unavoidably take Place in the Payment of the Troops , as will be beyond the Power of the most able Accountant to certify .

		These officers are so necessary that I should not have hesitated a Moment to have made the Appointments had I not received your Orders to the contrary .

		Give me Leave , Sir , to request a Copy of such Articles of War as the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	may have adopted .

		The scandalous Want of Subordination , and the Low Treatment which I am informed some Officers give , & others receive merit exemplary Punishment , as they are injurious to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, destructive to the Service , and disgraceful to those in Command.ー Govr -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Trumbul	PERSON	has honoured me with a Letter , in which he advises me that no more than forty Half Barrels of Powder can be sent from the
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	.

		That from
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	is not yet arrived , and you will perceive there is very little with the Troops .

		Should Govr -LSB- Guy -RSB-
Carlton	PERSON	know our true Situation with Respect to this Article , it would be very easy for him to use it to our Disadvantage Govr .

		Trumbul will send me fifteen Thousand Pounds in Money , which is so much wanted here , that the spirited Come of this Place have been under the Necessity of emitting one Thousand Pounds in small Bills as a circulating Medium to pay Troops and others employed in the Service , which , altho it passes as currently as
Bank Bills	ORGANIZATION	in the best of
Times	ORGANIZATION	, I shall order it to be called in , as soon as I am enabled to do it , least it should open a Door to Fraud and Confusion .

		As the Transportation of Salted Meat is attended with the very heavy Expence of a sixty five Mile Land Carriage to
Fort George	LOCATION	; before I left
New York	LOCATION	I ordered one Hundred Head of fat Cattle to be purchased in
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and to be drove up to
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, where there is a sufficiency of Pasture for them .

		I enclose you Sir an Extract of a Paper received from Govr Trumbull relative to the Temper of Coghnawaga Indians marked No 4 The Paper No 5 will shew you how very weak we are with Respect to Vessels for transporting Troops across the
Lake	LOCATION	, or even with those necessary to keep the
Command of the Lake	LOCATION	in Case Mr
Carlton	PERSON	should provide himself with a naval Force .

		I hope however soon after my Arrival at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	to be in a better Condition for maintaining the Advantage we have acquired .

		I hope to be at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	on Friday or Saturday from whence I shall do myself the Honour to transmit you a full Account of the State of the Troops , and of every other Matter which may be necessary for your Information .

		I am Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB- Ph

BENEDICT	PERSON	ARNOLD TO THE
CONTINENTAL CONGRESS	ORGANIZATION	1 Gentlemen :
Albany	LOCATION	July 11 , 1775 General -LSB-
Philip -RSB- Schuyler	PERSON	has desired me to acquaint you of the state and situation of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	in the
Northern Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		Six days since , when I left Crown Point , & here were at that post near three hundred men , without employ , having received no orders to fortify ; at
Ticonderoga	ORGANIZATION	about six hundred in the same state ; at
Fort George	LOCATION	, upwards of three hundred men ; some few employed in building batteaus , and on scouting parties .

		Very little provision at any of the places ; none made for the sick , which are daily increasing ; only five hundred weight of gunpowder at all the places , and no Engineer or Gunner at either .

		Great want of discipline and regularity among the troops .

		On the other hand , the enemy at
St. John	ORGANIZATION	's indefatiguable in fortifying , and collecting timber -LRB- supposed -RRB- for building a vessel .

		The disposition of the Canadians and Indians , from the latest accounts , very favourable .

		A promise has , however , been extorted from the latter to defend Governor
-LSB- Guy -RSB- Carleton	PERSON	if attacked , in
Montreal	LOCATION	; this of course .

		By giving up the command , I have been prevented receiving regular intelligence as heretofor ; the latest near twenty days since .

		I have received no answer to my letter of the 13th June , by Captain
-LSB- Eleazer -RSB- Oswald	PERSON	.

		Can only add , I am , with the greatest respect , Gentlemen -LSB- & c. -RSB-
Benedict Arnold P.S.	ORGANIZATION	I had forgot to inform you my Regiment is disbanded .

Peter Herring	PERSON	the man who last night assisted in conveying on board the

		I would beg the immediate advice of the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	concerning what is best to be done with him his brother is willing and desirous that he should be sent away somewhere , that he may be out of the way of the enraged people ; some have proposed that he be sent on board the
Asia	LOCATION	; others think it best to have him sent to
Connecticut	LOCATION	with Gov.
-LSB- Philip -RSB- Skeene	PERSON	, who will go off as soon as this matter can be determined .

		I hope , therefore , to be assisted with your advice as speedily as possible , and am , sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		Gentlemen : We have received your favour of the 8th of the last month ,3 which came to our hands last night .

		Our

Peter Herring	PERSON	being brought before the committee , Gen. -LSB-
David -RSB- Wooster	PERSON	charged and accused him of being aiding and assisting to one
Lundin	PERSON	4 yesterday evening in making his escape from the confinement he was under by order of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Several witnesses were examined as to the charge , in the presence of the said
Peter Herring	PERSON	.

		Resolved , That it fully appears to this Committee , by the testimony of sundry witnesses , as also by the examination and confession of
Peter Herring	ORGANIZATION	, of the city of
New York	LOCATION	, that the said
Peter Herring	PERSON	was aiding and assisting to one
Lundin	PERSON	, yesterday evening , in making his escape from the confinement he was in , by order of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	; and the said
Peter Herring	PERSON	assisted him to get on board the
Asia	LOCATION	man of war , and was the means of getting him on board of the said ship .

		Resolved and ordered , therefore , That the said
Peter Herring	PERSON	be sent , under such guard as Gen.
Wooster	PERSON	shall appoint , to
Connecticut	LOCATION	, to be there confined in close goal at the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	charge , until he shall be thence discharged by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		2 .

		As the
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	anchored in
Sandy Hook	PERSON	at 11:30 on the morning of July 9 -LRB- PRO , Admiralty 51/629 -RRB- , it is not likely that Captain
John Collins	PERSON	's requisition reached
Abraham Lott	PERSON	before the evening of July 10 ; hence his letter to the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	probably was written on the morning of the day it was received .

		3 .

		The letter was mis-dated , and should have been July 8 , 1775 .

		This is evidenced by the comment that Governor
Martin	PERSON	's intercepted letter previously had been sent to the
New York Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	by the
Philadelphia Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		That communication was read in Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, June 27 , 1775 .

Lundin	PERSON	, or

Virginia	LOCATION	, had taken our men , who were on shore , prisoners .

		Upon this , our Lieutenant ordered me off to enquire into the matter .

		I walked up -LSB- to -RSB- their camp , which consisted of a few pales covered with leaves , and found two hundred rebels round our men , whom they had been informed belonged to the Otter ; and at my arrival vowed , that if they caught any belonging to the Fowey man of war , they would never let them go .

		I enquired into the reason why they detained the men , and was asked to whom they belonged ; I answered to the King .

		The Captain of the , Guard then asked me if I belonged to the Otter and if any of the men or officers would venture on shore again .

		I told him , that both officers and men would , if they were ordered , come on shore to any duty .

		They said they hoped they would behave themselves well , or they would get something they did not like .

		I replied that if saying they belonged to the King was impertinent , it was the answer they must always expect .

		The day before yesterday we went to

Powder-Horn Hill	LOCATION	, back of
Chelsea	LOCATION	, we saw a skirmish between a party of our people -LRB- 120 in number -RRB- who went in whale boats , to an island about 12 miles from
Boston	LOCATION	, and burnt a large quantity of hay , which was put up into bundles by the Regulars , and intended to be sent to
Boston	LOCATION	for their horses .

		A great number of marines , in schooners , men of war 's boats , and two ships of war kept up a constant fire on our men , while they remained on the Island ; but this did not prevent them from destroying the hay .

		The schooner and boats endeavoured to cut off their retreat , which brought on a very warm engagement , in which we had one killed and one wounded ... We have just got over land from Cape-Cod a large fleet of whale boats , in a day or two we shall man them in
Cambridge	LOCATION	and Mystick rivers , and try to keep our enemies boats from insulting us .

Shoal Water	LOCATION	where they escaped ; but the Kings Boats came near enough to fire at them several times , and the Admiral was afterwards informed the Rebels had two men Killed and several wounded .

		However they had already set fire to the Houses and Barns on the
Islands	LOCATION	which were unavoidably destroyed .

		And it was impossible to prevent this without employing constantly Guards of Soldiers on the
Islands	LOCATION	, and a number of small Vessels armed in the passages adjoining to the Main , which last , if the preservation of what was on the
Island	LOCATION	had been an Object , our small naval force would not admit of .

		Indeed , according to this plan , it would have required our whole Force in Detachments to secure all the Islands from Depredation , which their vicinity to the Main left them open to with very little trouble to the Rebels .

		And these excursions were always conducted with such Secresy and Dispatch that the Flames were generally the first Notice of their Intentions .

		ー I judged it best to detain her a few days from a certain Persuasion of sending by her Certificates on the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	for the Amount of her whole Cargo , but in this am likewise disappointed & was not till Yesterday discovered that the Number of
Blls	PERSON	exceeded the Invoices by Eighteen , for which no Invoice can be found & will occasion a thorough overhawl of the whole Cargo , which will take up a great Deal of Time & be attended with much Trouble & on the whole have concluded to dispatch her to you & take the chance of an Opportunity to send the Certificates for the Cargo on the Treasury.ー As the Cargo has been appraised , the Wheat a 5/4d p Bushel , fine flour 18 / pC , spfine do 20 / & the Indian Corn at 3/4 I cou 'd not possibly obtain Freight ; I therefore solicited that the Warrants on the

Power of Payment	ORGANIZATION	in your own Hands when you are furnished with them , which I shall take Care not to lose sight of till possessed .

		ー This I mention because I think I have a Right to charge Commission on the Cargo which wou 'd never be settled without some Person 's interfering , & no one cou 'd with so much Propriety as myself .

		LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LRB- NO 29 -RRB- The Fowey in
York	LOCATION	river July the 12th 1775 My Lord Since my letter No. 28 dispatched by his Majesty 's Schooner the
Magdalen	LOCATION	, the last Resolves of the house of
Burgesses	LOCATION	have been made publick , and I now transmit them to your Lordship in the Supplement of the publick Printers News paper -LRB- mark therein B -RRB- 2 the Same Supplement contains under the
Williamsburg	LOCATION	head of the 30th .

		of June , an Account of the proceedings of a meeting of the Inhabitants of that city `` convened , by the honorable
Peyton Randolph Esq	PERSON	, '' the Speaker of the house of
Burgesses	LOCATION	, `` to consider of the expediency of Stationing a number of men there for the publick Safety , and to assist the
Citizens	ORGANIZATION	in their nightly watches to guard against any surprise from their Enemies , '' by which no others can be meant than the kings Governor , and the kings Forces of a twenty Gun Ship and a Sloop of War , Stationed in this Colony .

		In consequence of this Step of Mr.
Randolphs	PERSON	a great number of people , horse and Foot , from various parts of the country have flocked to
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, armed and accoutred , and wearing uniforms , and , the different Companies , their badges of distinction .

		They have made a Barrack of the
Capitol	LOCATION	, a large building in which are held the Courts of Justices , and intended for the
Council	ORGANIZATION	and house of Burgesses with their different offices , and they have taken possession of the Park -LRB- a Considerable piece of land adjoining and belonging to the Governors house -RRB- for their Cavalry , wantonly Cutting and maiming my Cattle which they found there .

		A few days after the arrival of these Gentry a number of them broke , a Second time , into the Palace -LRB- the Governors house -RRB- and , as the first time , of which I have informed your Lordship , they went no further than taking the Arms which they found in a Hall , this time they broke open every lock of the doors of all the rooms , Cabinets and private places , and carried off a considerable number of arms of different Sorts , a large Collection , and valuable , my own property .

		This Violence was committed in the face of day ; the leaders in it well known , and one of the principal was to Son of Mr -LSB-
Robert Carter	PERSON	-RSB-
Nicholas	PERSON	-LSB- III -RSB- 3 the Treasurer , the Same who was lately made a controler of his Majesty 's
Customs	ORGANIZATION	; Mr
Nicholas the Father	PERSON	and the Speaker , who now direct the proceedings of this country , were then in
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, and Consequently could not but be privy to this infamous robbery ; this violation of private property , as well as atrocious outrage against the
kings Authority	ORGANIZATION	.

		The very day after this , I happened , for the only time Since I first embarked on board his Majesty 's Ship , to go , in the man of wars Barge , to a Farm -LRB- my own Property -RRB- about Seven miles from
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, Situated upon a
Creek	LOCATION	which runs into
York	LOCATION	river about twelve miles above
the Town of York	LOCATION	where the Ship lay .

		The Barge was observed from the Town , and it was easily conjectured where I was going ; accordingly intelligence was immediately Sent to Williamsbur ` g , and Just after Captain -LSB-
George -RSB- Montague	PERSON	and I had done dinner , that Gentleman having accompanied me , we were informed by my Servants that a body of men in Arms were Seen advancing directly to the
House	ORGANIZATION	, which we likewise Saw ourselves upon going out , and we had but Just time to get into our boat and to escape ; two men , Carpenters of the Ship , whom we had brought with us in order to cut down a mast for a boat , and who were at a little distance from my house , were Seized by these people , upon my own land , and have been made prisoners , and are now confined in
Williamsburg	LOCATION	under a guard , 4 a Servant , who got into a Canoe to follow me , a very little time afterwards , was fired at four or five different times .

		Two days ago the Mercury a twenty Gun Ship arrived here to relieve the
Fowey	LOCATION	, which has been Stationed here Some time .

		Intelligence was given on the coast by a Pilot boat of her approach ; and Mr
-LSB- Archibald	PERSON	-RSB- Cary the Naval officer of the lower district of
James river	LOCATION	, a considerable office under Government , who is one of the most active and virulent of the
Enemies of Government	ORGANIZATION	, immediately dispatched Expresses , to allarm the Country , representing that the Ship brought a great number of Soldiers for disembarkation , & the Speaker and Treasurer gladly Seized this pretence for infusing fresh apprehensions of threatening danger ; and for enviting more people down from all parts of the colony .

		A detachment was immediately Sent off from
Williamsburg	LOCATION	to reinforce the company in
York Town	LOCATION	, which arrived the Same evening as the man of war ; and we have now a Camp of these People behind the
Town of York	ORGANIZATION	, not half a Cannon-Shot from the Ships ; and the men are Continually parading in arms along the Shore Close to us , and at night we hear them challenge every boat or person that approaches them .

		Thus my Lord the People of
Virginia	LOCATION	manifest open Rebellion by every means in their power , and they declare at the Same time that they are his Majesty 's Most dutyfull Subjects , `` that they will to the utmost of their power , at all times , and at risk of their lives and properties maintain and defend his Government in this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, as founded on the established laws and principles of the Constitution , '' and that as designs have never been formed against my person , but that I may , when ever I please return to my usual Resedence without the least danger ; notwithstanding that my own Servants are prevented from passing with provisions which is thus cut off from me & denied to me , my people have been Carried off by the guard ; while my house has been a third time rifled , and is now entirely in the possession of these lawless Ruffians .

		It is necessary your Lordship Should be made acquainted , that the Fund , out of which the Salary of the Governor , and some other officers , is paid , as it arises from the duty , as your Lordship knows , upon Tobacco exported , and upon the Tonnage of all Vessels trading to the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, will fail entirely after the first of September next , when by the association , all exports to great
Britain	LOCATION	are to cease .

		5 I have for near two years received little or no perquisites of my office , as the collectors can not be brought to account , but after the first of September , I shall receive neither perquisite nor Salary ; I hope therefore your Lordship will acquaint me how I am to Subsist , if it be his Majesty 's pleasure that his Governor remain here .

		It will likewise be necessary that I should be instructed in regard of what disbursements I may be allowed to make for my own accomodation ; I am obliged to hire a vessel for my Servants and baggage , and , for the future , I Shall be obliged to make it my own residence , there not being room for me in the Man of War which relieves the Fowey : and I can not but hope that the inconvenience and distress which I must necessarily go thro ' in this Situation will be considered as proof of my zeal for his majesty 's Service .

		A Vessel must likewise be hired for the hundred men which I wrote to your Lordship I had Sent for , as no quarters can be procured for them on Shore .

		I hope your Lordship will give me directions how these unavoidable expenses are to be defrayed .

		Your Lordships letter No 19 has been received and , by the last
New York Post	ORGANIZATION	, a dispatch was brought to me all open .

		In the cover , which I hear inclose Just in the Condition as I found it , were two papers which had been taken out of a packet , likewise broke open , containing private letters which came at the Same time , and no letter of your Lordships .

		In a large bundle of papers which , after they had broke open , they put up in the greatest disorder without any desire to Conceal the attempt , I found a parcel of printed papers , the Speech of General -LSB-
John -RSB- Burgoyne	PERSON	; a letter from your Lordship Signifying his majestys pleasure that the orders of the Commander in chief of the Forces , and , under him , of the Major Generals and Brigadiers , Shall be Supreme in all Cases relating to the operations of the Troops ; and letters from Mr. -LSB-

		I am unable to say whether any papers were taken away or not , but your Lordship from this account will know .

		I can not find out where these packets were broke open .

		I wrote to you 6th Inst by a Ship bound to
London	LOCATION	, but wh Is not yet sailed desiring Insurance on 32 hhds on board the
Marlborough	LOCATION	.

		I have put two -LSB- hhds of Tobacco -RSB- on Board
Clarke	PERSON	, & am in Hopes I shall be able to furnish him with 8 more in a few Days .

		The 22 marked E L K you will find uncommonly neat , & heavier than usual .

		The critical Situation of American Disputes , & the very small Probability there is of a speedy Accomodation must in a few Months render Tobo a very valuable & scarce Article in G
Britain	LOCATION	.

		You will be pretty well able to judge of the Complexion of the
Times	ORGANIZATION	from our News Papers , altho ' it may not be amiss to appri -LSB- se -RSB- you that both Parties do not relate Transactions , or represent Temper with that Candor , wh ought ever to distinguish the Actions of Men in publick Sphere .

		I am afraid all Parties have not exerted a benevolent Influence to accomodate this Dispute ー in every Convulsion of this Kind the Minds of Men will be prejudiced , & some will be apt , perhaps , to chalk out , in Idea , Schemes more suitable to their own Wishes , than the Welfare of the Community ー Such Persons become dangerous , & are most frequently catched in their own Snare ー I hope , as yet , we have none such amongst us , but if this unhappy Dispute shd continue much longer , as I am afraid it will , it is not improbable but some aspiring Genius may be tempted to swerve from the Line of their Duty , & thereby plunge their Fellow Citizens into an Abyss of Misery ... 1 .

		It is certain that a boat from the Fowey or Otter landed several armed men on an island in the lower end of this country , who stole fourteen sheep and a cow .

		However , the people , who are now well furnished with arms , & c. will be ready to give them a warm reception , should they favour them with another visit .

Preston Boston	PERSON	15 July 1775 .

		I have received your Letters July 6 acquainting me with the Seizure of the Sloop and Schooner laden with wood , Spars and mercantile fish , and that all your Endeavours to get them prosecuted in the Vice Admiralty Court at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	have been ineffectual .

		I observe the Judge makes no objections , well knowing these Causes can not be brought before him , but the Lawyers speak out and boldly assert that no man can move in behalf of the Laws or attempt to carry them into Execution without risquing his life and property .

		To what purpose then do these Gentlemen remain at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, for as all Civil Departments of Government are entirely useless among the People and obnoxious to them , it will be well if the Rebels allow them to partake of the Supplies permitted to pass for their Support : And the Kings Affairs receiving no Advantage from his Servants remaining totally and unavoidably inactive , they had better remove , and not , by continuing among a violent People determined to be in Rebellion , retard the Execution of such Measures as are become absolutely necessary to reduce the Province of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	to a due Observance of the Laws .

		I therefore will no longer consent that Supplies of any kind pass to
Portsmouth	LOCATION	and you will herewith receive an Order to the contrary accordingly .

		I inclose the Attorney Generals Opinion as you have desired , and will order the Hope to convoy the Vessels to
Boston	LOCATION	as soon as possible .

Preston Boston	PERSON	15 July 1775 .

		Those parts of your Letters July 7 and 9 relating to the Province Treasure being delivered to the Rebels must undoubtedly surprise every person .

		People in open and avowed Rebellion fighting the
Kings Forces	ORGANIZATION	, will never hesitate a moment to seize money wherever they can lay hands on it .

		But as Governor -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB-
Wentworth	LOCATION	must have expected such a step to be taken , he was perhaps not empowered alone to remove the Province money , or thought an attempt to secure it for the King would only accelerate its seizure by the Rebels .

		Whatever Reasons therefore his Excellency might have had for letting the money remain in the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, he alone must answer for its Loss .

		I am entirely satisfied with your Conduct in this matter .

		The Rebels are increasing their Numbers daily and carrying on Approaches to the Lines at the Neck ; they have collected a Number of Whaleboats ; it is said near three hundred .

		A Party of them visited one of the
Islands	LOCATION	in this
Harbour	PERSON	, took off the Stock , and burnt the Houses .

		It is I believe generally thought they will make an Attempt upon the Town of
Boston	LOCATION	.

Washington	LOCATION	.

		You had prepaired me to entertain a favorable opinion of him , but I thought the one half was not told me .

		Dignity with ease , and complacency , the Gentleman and Soldier look agreably blended in him .

		Modesty marks every line and feture of his face ... There has been a little Expidition this week to
Long Island	LOCATION	.

		There has been before several attempts to go on but 3 men of war lay near , and cutters all round the Island that they could not succeed .

		A number of whale boats lay at
Germantown	LOCATION	; 300 volenters commanded by one Capt.
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Tupper	PERSON	came on mon. day evening -LSB- July 10 -RSB- and took the boats , went on and brought of -LSB- f -RSB- 70 odd Sheep , 15 head of cattle , and 16 prisoners 13 of whom were sent by Simple Sapling to mow the Hay which they had very badly executed .

		They were all a sleep in the house and barn when they were taken .

		There were 3 women with them .

		Our Heroes came of -LSB- f -RSB- in triumph not being observed by their Enimies .

		This spiritted up other -LSB- s -RSB- .

		They could not endure the thought that the
House	ORGANIZATION	and barn should afford them any shelter .

		They did not distroy them the night before for fear of being discovererd .

		Capt.

		A number of armed cutters immediately Surrounded the Island , fired upon our Men .

		They came of -LSB- f -RSB- with a hot and continued fire upon them , the Bullets flying in every .

		direction and the Men of Wars boats plying them with small arms .

		Many in this Town who were spectators expected every moment our Men would all be sacrificed , for sometimes they were so near as to be calld to and damnd by their Enimies and orderd to surrender yet they all returnd in safty , not one Man even wounded .

		Upon the Moon we lost one Man from the cannon on board the Man of War .

		On the Evening of the same day a Man of War came and anchord near

Boston	LOCATION	.

		Captain -LSB-
William -RSB- Duddingstone	PERSON	in the
Senegal	LOCATION	, whom I had stationed at
Casco Bay	LOCATION	, and to whose particular attention I had recommended the Ship Minerva ,
Thomas Coulson	PERSON	, Master , returned with that Vessel the 1st instant to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I have in a former Letter acquainted you that the Minerva was built at
Falmouth	LOCATION	for a Mast Ship , and that a Vessel brought her rigging Sails and other Materials from
England	LOCATION	; from the time of her being launched , some of his Majesty 's Squadron have constantly protected her and the Store Vessel from being destroyed .

		Disappointed by the Rebels of getting Masts at
Piscatagua	LOCATION	, Mr
Coulson	PERSON	returned to
Falmouth	LOCATION	to endeavour to procure a Cargo for
England	LOCATION	.

		It was absolutely impossible ; and such preparations were making to destroy her , that Captain
Duddingstone	PERSON	at the Masters earnest Intreaty returned with him again to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Soon after the
Senegal	LOCATION	arrived General -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	applied to me for Convoy to four Transports and three or four Sloops his Excellency was sending to procure fuel for the Army : I ordered the
Senegal	LOCATION	upon this Service , and she sailed immediately for
Penobscot Bay	PERSON	with her Convoy the 10th instant .

		By Captain
Duddingstone	PERSON	I received the disagreeable News that the
Margueritta	LOCATION	hired Schooner had been attacked and taken by the Rebels ; I acquainted you in my Letter June 16 with her being sent Convoy with some Vessels appointed to bring firewood for his Majesty 's Service at
Boston	LOCATION	.

		This Vessel except that she had no Carriage Guns , was well appointed ; She had Swivels , Musquets , Pistols ,
Hand Grenadoes	PERSON	, manned with twenty of the best Men in the
Preston	PERSON	and commanded by a very good Midshipman .

		The only Account I have yet seen is contained in the inclosed News Papers , but there is no doubt of its being a true Report .

		The 28th Captain -LSB-
Tyringham	LOCATION	-RSB-
Howe	PERSON	in the
Glasgow	LOCATION	sailed with Orders to cruize three weeks from the back of
Nantucket Shoals	ORGANIZATION	to the West end of

Security of Transports	ORGANIZATION	expected with Troops from
Ireland	LOCATION	, then to proceed to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	and put himself under the Command of Captain -LSB-

		... Captain
Wallace	PERSON	has sent round a Sloop with Flour and Sugar , a Seizure of 45 Hogsheads of Rum taken in different Boats , and a small Vessel with Refreshments ; he acquaints me that the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	have voted 500 men more for the Rebellion , struck off # 10,000 additional money , and ordered
Fort Island	LOCATION	to be taken possession of .

		The latter will be prevented if possible .

		I transmit a Copy of one of Captain
Wallace	PERSON	's Letters inclosing an Association of some of the Principal People in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		Other Accounts say that seven Sail of Brigs and Sloops are at
Providence	LOCATION	from 14 to 8 Guns , well manned , and that they have nearly finished two large row Boats for 24 Oars and two prow Guns in each .

		... In Consequence of my Orders for that purpose Captain -LSB-
George -RSB- Vandeput	PERSON	employs the Kingsfisher cruising in the Sound and off the Hook occasionally , with orders to seize and send to
Boston	LOCATION	all Vessels laden with provisions , Melasses and Salt , Flour , Grain & c. Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	acquaints me further that there are many who wish to keep the peace in
New York	LOCATION	on account of their property , that several of these have got into Committees and the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, thro ' whose influence perhaps it is that as yet the Kings Ships have met with no difficulty in getting the provisions required .

		I transmit an Extract from one of Captain
Vandeput	PERSON	's Letters merely to shew what dependence there is upon the professions of these People , and the Deceit and Cunning with which they manage their Affairs .

		Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Macartney	PERSON	of the Mercury acquaints me that at the end of thirteen days from the time of his sailing from
Boston	LOCATION	, he spoke to the Spy Transport with part of the 43d Regiment and sent her to
Boston	LOCATION	, the same day he met the Lord
Hyde Pacquet	PERSON	and anchored with her at
Sandy Hook	PERSON	the 16th and delivered her into the care of Captain
James Montagu of the Kingsfisher	PERSON	, who convoyed her to Town the next day .

		Captain
Macartney	PERSON	after cruizing a few days returned again to the Hook , and as the Transports arrived assisted them to Water , which they ` were all in want of , and sent them to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Collins	PERSON	, in a Letter dated
Nautilus	ORGANIZATION	at Sea June 30 , acquaints me that he had convoyed the Schooner with the Spaniards and their money going to
Cadiz	LOCATION	, together with the Ship Thomas bound to
London	LOCATION	,
Fifty Leagues East of Cape Cod	ORGANIZATION	, and that he had left them safe on the 18th with a fair Wind to continue their Voyages ; that he got on his station the 24th fell in with four Transports , and learning from a Pilot Boat the Mercury was at the Hook he went in , and having delivered his Pacquet to Captain
Macartney	PERSON	proceeded in search of the Transports not arrived .

		The Mercury sailed soon after the -LSB- for -RSB-
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Captain -LSB-
Francis -RSB- Parry	PERSON	of the Cruizer at
North Carolina	LOCATION	acquaints me , by Letter dated June 1st that the people in this Province are very violent , that it had been proposed in a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to man a number of Vessels and attack the Cruizer , that he doth not expect to get any more provisions there , and that the last Vessels which supplied him , would have been unloaded if she staid till the Morning .

		I inclose a Copy of a Letter to Captain
Parry	PERSON	from the Captain of
Fort Johnstone	PERSON	, who received from the Cruizer two Barrels and half of Powder ; and Captain
Parry	PERSON	intends to remain near the Fort with his Majesty 's Sloop .

		Governor
-LSB- Josiah -RSB- Martin	PERSON	, in a Letter to me dated
North Carolina	LOCATION	New bern May 27,1775 , wishes to have a Cutter , drawing not more than 7 or 8 feet Water at most , to be near the place of his Residence , where he represents himself to be with a few friends to Government totally helples and destitute of Protection .

		I inclose Copies of Letters from Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	to myself and Captain
Geo	PERSON	.


Montagu	PERSON	, also an Extract of a Letter from Captain
Montagu	PERSON	acquainting me that by desire of Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	he had sent the
Magdalen	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	with his Excellencys Dispatches to the Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		I can not at this Distance judge of the necessity for such a Measure , but submit to their Lordship 's Consideration that no part of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	ought at any time to be sent away without the Commander in Chief 's Order , unless the Service is of a very pressing Nature and no Vessel can be hired , in which an Officer might carry Dispatches not safe to be trusted with the Master .

		The sending his Majesty 's Ships or Vessels home from their Stations express with a Governors Dispatches , is more likely to happen during the rebellion in
America	LOCATION	than at any other time ; therefore if the Governors of other Provinces have nearly the same Accounts to transmit , should apply to the Captains on their Stations to proceed immediately to
England	LOCATION	, and they follow Captain
Montagu	PERSON	's Example , the Coast may be left entirely unguarded and every kind of contraband Trade carried on with Impunity , while the Commander in chief is totally unacquainted for some time with the Disposal of his Majesty 's Ships under his Command , for whose proceedings he is to be accountable .

		This is likewise the Season and Crisis when a much greater number of Kings Ships and Vessels than are now on the Station could be employed to very great Advantage for his Majesty 's Service .

		`` THE PEOPLE '' TO
JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA 1 Sir ,
Brunswick	LOCATION	, July 16th 1775 .

		As the Establishment of
Fort Johnston	PERSON	was intended to protect the Inhabitants of
Cape Fear River	LOCATION	from all invasions of a foreign Enemy in times of War , and during the Peace has been supported at a very great expence to this Province , and not only to prevent contagious and infectious disorders , but to aid and support the Trade and Navigation thereof , and where as by the conduct of the Captain of the said Fort most of these salutary ends have been entirely defeated , and added to this as by incontestible proof , we can make appear that not only the private property of individuals has been cruelly and illegally invaded and detained by the most atrocious injuries , were by the said Captain intended and in some degree carried into execution contrary to every principle of justice and humanity , and dangerous to the lives and property of the Inhabitants of this Province , we herewith beg leave to lay before your Excellency a state of some of those facts which have come to our knowledge , Viz his wanton detention of Vessels applying for Bills of health , his threats of vengeance against Magistrates whose opinion in the execution of their office he happened to disapprove , his sitting in defiance the High Sheriff of the
County	LOCATION	in the execution of his office , and treating the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Writs served on him for just debts -LRB- which both as a Subject and a Soldier it was his duty to obey -RRB- with the shamefull contempt of wiping his backside with them , His unparalled Injustice in detaining and Embezzleing a large quantity of goods which having been unfortunately wrecked near the
Fort	LOCATION	, had from every principle of humanity the highest claims to his attention and care for the benefit of the unhappy sufferers , who legally demanded and frequently solicited in their behalf , his base encouragement of Slaves eloped from their Masters , feeding and employing them , and his atrocious and horrid declaration that he would excite them to an Insurrection .

		These circumstances Sir , and many others too tedious to enumerate , could not but excite the indignation and resentment of the publick , but grievous as they were we would for a time still have submitted to them in firm reliance , that the first meeting of an
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	would have relieved us , but upon being informed of Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Collet	PERSON	's intention of dismantleing the
Fort	LOCATION	, erected and supported at the real expence of this Colony for its Protection and Defence , we collected ourselves together in order to prevent it , but finding upon enquiry that he had already dismantled it nothing more is left us than to recover the Cannon thrown over the walls and left in a situation which must entirely ruin them , to a place where attention and care shall preserve them for His Majesty when His service shall require them , because with that we conceive the safety of this Province is intimately connected , with this intention we shall proceed to
Fort Johnston	PERSON	and that our conduct may not be misunderstood by your Excellency we have thought proper to give you this information and persuade ourselves we shall not meet obstruction from any person or persons whatsoever in the execution of a design so essential to His Majesty 's Service and the Publick utility .

		N. B .

		A Fresh instance of his violence in Captain
Collet	PERSON	has now come to our knowledge , a glaring invasion of private property in unwarrantably seizing a Quantity of Corn , the more inexcusable as provisions have never been withheld from him when ever he would pay for them , which provisions so seized we beg your Excellency would order him to restore to the proper owner , as also any Slave or slaves the property of other persons which he now harbours and detains .

		We are your Excellency 's Most obedient Humble Servants THE PEOPLE 1 .

		GOVERNOR
JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Cruizer Sloop of War in
Cape Fear River No Carolina	LOCATION	, July 16th 1775 Since my former Letters to your Lordship the continual reports of the People designing to make themselves Masters of
Fort Johnston	LOCATION	, & Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Collet	PERSON	's just and well grounded Representations that he would not pretend to hold the place , with only three or four men that he could depend upon , against a multitude said to be collecting to attack it , determined me to dismount the Artillery that is considerable in value , and to lay it under cover of the Cruizer 's Guns .

		I have also my Lord withdrawn the little remainder of the
Garrison	PERSON	, with the shot , and movable Stores , and shipped them on Board the vessel lately arrived from
Boston	LOCATION	, to take a lading of
Naval Stores	ORGANIZATION	here , pursuant to a Charter party , but the person to whom she is addressed having refused to load her , because she had been employed as a Transport in the
King 's Service	ORGANIZATION	to carry artillery to
Boston	LOCATION	, the Master as a matter of favour to me , has received the remnant of the Garrison of
Fort Johnston	LOCATION	, and some of its Stores on Board , while he lays here to accomplish the Days of his
Charter Party	ORGANIZATION	engagement , after which if no change of circumstances happens in the mean time , I shall think it necessary to engage the Vessel in the
King 's Service	ORGANIZATION	, for the purpose above mentioned , in which I hope your Lordship will hold me justified .

		2 Fort
Johnston My Lord	PERSON	, is a most contemptible thing , fit neither for the place of Arms , or an Asylum for the friends of Government , on account of the weakness and smallness of it , so that the keeping of it is of little consequence , and the Kings Artillery which is all that is good about it , will be as well secured under cover of the Cruizer 's Guns , at less charge , as upon the Walls of that little wretched place ; if I could furnish it with a sufficient
Garrison	PERSON	, which I could now only collect out of the Highlanders upon whom , by drawing forth a number of them for such a service , I should immediately turn the resentment of the whole Country , before they are provided with the means of defence , and by that step perhaps frustrate my best and fairest expectations , formed upon the strength and good dispositions of that people in this Colony .

		A further cogent reason with me for disarming Fort
Johnston	PERSON	was , that its Artillery , which is heavy might in the hands of the Mob , be turned against the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Ship and so annoy her as to oblige her to quit her present station which is most convenient in all respects .

		Hitherto instead of aiding me , he has very much prejudiced all the Measures which I have thought requisite to adopt for restoring his Majesty 's lost
Authority	ORGANIZATION	in this Government ; and his Conduct has been of such a Nature that I forsee it will be impossible for me ever , with propriety to apply to him for any Assistance if I should require it of him ; And as I think him utterly unfit for such a Command , I hope therefore You will by the most speedy means relieve him or send a different Person for the Command .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO CAPTAIN
GEORGE VANDEPUT	PERSON	,
H.M.S. ASIA	ORGANIZATION	AT
NEW YORK	LOCATION	1 Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	18 July 1775 .

		I acknowledge the Receipt of your Letters June 25 and July 9 , containing a pretty full Account of your transactions and proceedings with his Majesty 's Ships under your Command , and communicating many particulars very necessary for my Knowledge .

		It has given me great satisfaction that the Kings Ships have assisted the Transports from
England	LOCATION	to water at the Hook , and have conveyed them to
Boston	LOCATION	, where they are all safe arrived except one , which I hope will be in Tomorrow .

		By whatever means we get Provisions it is extremely favorable at this time , as the Supply expected from
England	LOCATION	is not arrived , and it is absolutely impossible to spare one Ounce from hence .

		I have received Letters from Captains -LSB-
John -RSB- Macartney	PERSON	and -LSB-
John -RSB- Collins	PERSON	, whom I hope by this time are at their respective Stations .

		The
Magdalen	ORGANIZATION	is gone to
England	LOCATION	.

		You must continue the Kingsfisher in the Sound , when she can be spared from other necessary Services .

		I have related to the Admiralty your Story of the -LSB- Provincial -RSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	restoring , and the Connecticutians stealing again the
Kings Stores	ORGANIZATION	at
Turtle Bay	LOCATION	.

		The Volunteers for the Fleet are arrived , so are the five Men , part of the intended Highland Regiment and are enlisted in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		I am quite satisfied with your Conduct in moving the
Asia	LOCATION	to a Birth better adapted for the Security of the New Carriages , in sending the publick Dispatches by the Transport , and in detaining the Schooner , & c. In regard to your wish for more positive Orders I am equally desirous of being authorized to give them .

		The restraining Acts forbid all Coasting Trade .

		All Persons illegally in Arms upon the Water are deemed Pirates , and every Aid or Assistance given or intended to be given to the Rebels is liable to be destroyed or seized and confiscated .

		So far I think the Laws are literally in our Favour .

		The necessities of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and Fleet authorize the detention of such Articles as they stand in need of ; at present these are Provisions of all Kinds , Flour , Grain , Melasses , Oats , Hay ,
Straw	PERSON	.

		The
Country Eastward of Boston	ORGANIZATION	is destitute of every Kind of Food , except Fish ; If we are fortunate in cutting off Supplies , its Inhabitants must soon be in extreme Distress .

		You are already sufficiently authorized to seize and detain as aforementioned ; On all other Occasions you must be governed by Circumstances , rememb ` ring that at present nothing but the clearest necessity to prevent the loss of , or injury to , his Majesty 's Ships or People entrusted to your Care , or to any others under your immediate Protection , will justify you acting offensively towards those you are among , but I hope soon to hear that
Great Britain	LOCATION	has determined upon the Measures to be followed , and that I shall receive Instructions accordingly .

		1775 As every stratagem must be used to procure provisions at this Juncture , the Contractor for the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	has ordered his Correspondent Mr
Wm McAdams	PERSON	at
New York	LOCATION	to charter a Vessel from 80 to 100 Tons , and to put on Board her Bread , Beef , Peas , Oatmeal , and
Rice	PERSON	.

		These Provisions are to be consigned to
John Grant	PERSON	Esqr Spanish Town
Jamaica	LOCATION	, and the Vessel of course will be cleared for that place .

		No person in
New York	LOCATION	can possibly know but she really is intended for
Jamaica	LOCATION	, not even Mr
McAdams	PERSON	himself , who is ordered to write an Account of his Proceedings on this Business , And to draw upon
London	LOCATION	for the Amount .

		When this Vessel so laden goes down the River you must seize her , and putting a sufficient Strength on board send her to
Boston	LOCATION	; but I desire this may not be done till she is at the Hook , that the knowledge of this transaction may not get to
New York	LOCATION	and prevent our future Success , for which Reason all the People and the Master must be sent hither .

		If the
Kingfisher	ORGANIZATION	could sail at the same time with the provision Vessel , and alter her destination at Sea , it would be better and blank Letters directed to
Jamaica	LOCATION	might be put on board her early from your Ship , so that no Suspicion would arise of your detaining her upon any supposed Exigency of Service .

Ship Asia	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, July 18 , 1775 .

		Relying on your discretion and prudence , I have to request your assistance in an affair that I imagine will require some dexterity to manage properly .

		I want to have a few articles out of the medicine store put on board Captain
-LSB- George -RSB- Vandeput	PERSON	's Ship , to be sent here , if you think it can be done so as not to be observed .

		You must consult with
Bowden	PERSON	about it , who has the care of them ; and I hope will meet with no difficulty in putting into the man-of-war boat at
Blundell	PERSON	's house , at noon day , to avoid suspicion , a box of lint , the two boxes pulv .

		Peruvian , one do .


Sal Glaub	PERSON	.

		The pot of camphire , and what opium there is packed in another small box .

		If you ca n't easily send all these articles , the box of lint , which is most wanted , may be easily carried under the arm ; as also the camphire and opium .

		Scrape off the marks , and after it is on board , direct it for me at this place .

		Be cautious how you open the front part of the store .

		I believe you will find the key at Mrs.
Reid	PERSON	's ; as Mrs.
Mallett	PERSON	tells me she left all the keys with her ; you will leave them there again when you have got out the above articles .

		I hope
Bowden	PERSON	will take all the care he can both of the medicines and bedding store , and give me immediate notice if any one offers to meddle with them ; and tell them for me , that I will take care he shall be satisfied for his trouble .

		If the key should not be there , I must get you to write to Mrs.
Mallett	PERSON	, or to go up , if necessary , to know where it is put .

		I left them all in a drawer of my desk , and I dare say you will find them at Mrs.
Reid	PERSON	's , as I know that of the bedding store is there .

		I should be glad of a bale or two of old sheets , but am afraid it will be difficult to get them .

		Do n't risk any thing , but first let me know if it is practicable to get them , and several other articles I want , out of the medicine store on some future occasion .

		Captain
Kingston	PERSON	, who brings you this , has directions to find you or
Bowden	PERSON	, and give you all the assistance he can , and will take care of whatever you give into his charge .

		There are some lancets , needles , scalpels , and pocket instruments , in one of my drawers also ; if they could be got at , I should be glad they were sent here ; but I fear Mrs.
Mallett	PERSON	has the keys in the country .

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	will write to you on this subject , to enjoin your transacting this business with all imaginable precaution ; and be assured you will , in return , meet with every thing to serve you in the power of your assured friend ,

John -RSB- Collet Governor of Fort Johnston	PERSON	, that the Garrison of that place was reduced to no more than three or four men that he could depend upon , and that he had received advice of a considerable body of the People of the Country being collecting in order to attack the place , he had thought it advisable for the preservation of His Majesty 's Artillery to dismount the Guns in the Fort and to lay them under the protection of the guns of His Majesty 's Ship of War and to withdraw the little remnant of the Garrison the shot and small Stores and to place them in security on

King	ORGANIZATION	's Ship if as was reported , the People meditated an Attack upon her .

		The Governor and

Parry	PERSON	were unanimously of opinion that if he found it consistant with his Majesty 's Service it would be advisable to retain the men who offered themselves on Board His Majesty 's Ship under His Command until they could be otherwise provided for .

Nathan Adams	PERSON	, a Pilot .

		-LSB- Extract -RSB- Cruizer Sloop of War 9 o'clock at night , July 18th 1775 I have received this minute a Letter signed `` The People , '' representing many unwarantable proceedings of Capt -LSB-
John -RSB- Collet	PERSON	, which it would have been always my Duty to enquire into , and to prevent as far as lay in my power , if I had been made acquainted with them timely .

		In all cases where his indiscretions have come to my knowledge , I have interposed my advice and authority , and I persuade myself not without effect , as well appears by his delivering up the Wines he has detained in his possession .

		There are other allegations against him in the letter I have received of most heinous nature of which I never heard a word before , of his unjustifiable seizure of the Corn , I have been informed and highly disapproved , and remonstrated against it , and shall use my utmost authority to make him restore it .

		The dismounting of the King 's Artillery , in
Fort Johnston	LOCATION	, has been done by my
Authority	ORGANIZATION	, and by Virtue of the Powers vested in me by His Majesty from conviction that it was expedient for the
King 's Service	ORGANIZATION	, and it will be my Duty as you may be ascured it will be my care to prevent , any injury happening to them where they are laid for the present .

		I must therefore hope and desire that you will not under the mistaken belief of Captain
Collet	PERSON	having dismounted the Cannon in
Fort Johnston	PERSON	of himself proceed in your present design of removing them , as you will thereby do violence against
Lawfull Authority	ORGANIZATION	which it will be inconsistent with my Duty to errn nit , and which can not fail to draw upon YOU His Majesty 's highest displeasure .

		For these reasons I do most earnestly advise , exhort and intreat you to desist from your purpose .

		As Your sincere friend and well wisher 1 .

JOHN STUART	PERSON	, SUPERINTENDENT FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS IN THE SOUTHERN DEPARTMENT , TO SOUTH CAROLINA COMMITTEE OF INSPECTION 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, July 18 , 1775 .

		Your letter of the 29th renders it necessary for me to tell you , that some time before I left
Charlestown	LOCATION	I had received information of a design to seize my person ; and in order to give colour to such a step , a report was industriously propagated of my having sent to call down the Indians .

		Immediately after my removal from
Charlestown	LOCATION	to my plantation on
Lady 's Island	LOCATION	, it was reported , that in consequence of my orders , thirty-four families on the frontiers had been murdered by the Cherokees .

		When I was at
Georgia	LOCATION	, I had information that Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Joyner	PERSON	and Mr. -LSB-
John -RSB- Barnwell	PERSON	, two members of the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, had returned to
Beaufort	LOCATION	; where , by most defamatory reports and insinuations , they endeavoured to blacken my character , and render me obnoxious to the people ; giving out that my having called down the Indians was proven before the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; that great quantities of arms and ammunition were shipped for me to arm the Negroes and Indians , and that it was now discovered that I had sold
Fort London	LOCATION	, and was the instrument of getting the garrison massacred ; and Captain
Joyner	PERSON	showed at the public muster-field , in
St. Helena	LOCATION	, printed bills , containing the above , and other false accusations .

		From thence they went to
Savannah	LOCATION	, and in the night had a meeting with the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, of which Sir
James Wright	PERSON	gave me notice early next morning , and advised me to take steps for the security of my person .

		I accordingly prevailed upon Captain -LSB-
William -RSB- Grant	PERSON	, of the St.
John	PERSON	, armed schooner , to land me at
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, where the business of my department called me .

		But before I embarked , I saw some of the members of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, and read to them some part of my correspondence with my Deputies , which they communicated to you .

		They candidly told me that the people were much enraged ; and they could not answer for the safety of my person .

		I then thought it high time to provide for my safety ; and went on board the St.
John	PERSON	, armed schooner , at Cockspur .

		I have since been informed , that two boats were sent down the river in pursuit of me ; and from the schooner I saw several armed canoes , said to be commanded by Captain
Joyner	PERSON	and Mr.
Barnwell	PERSON	, who , before they left
Beaufort	LOCATION	, gave out they were to receive and conduct me back to
Charlestown	LOCATION	.

		The armed schooner , however , proceeded the next day for this place , where I landed in a very weak condition ; and this , gentlemen , you are pleased to call a precipitate departure , though I shall ever consider it as a most fortunate escape .

		AN ACCOUNT OF THE THREAT TO DESTROY THE TOWN OF
NEWPORT	LOCATION	1 By a Gentleman from
Newport	LOCATION	,
Rhode-Island	PERSON	, who was there at the time the town was threatened with total ruin by the three pirates of war stationed in said harbour , we are favobred with the following particulars : On Monday night , the 17th of July -LSB- 1775 -RSB- , two men belonging to the Swan , Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Ayscough	PERSON	, being on shore , saw fit to attempt an escape from their old and detested habitation , their design -LRB- by the bye -RRB- was communicated to no individual of the town .

		The next day , viz. the 18th , A.M. two or three of the ferry boats which pass between
Newport	LOCATION	and Connanicut were fired upon and brought too , an event so singular that two respectable members of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	waited upon Capt.
Ayscough	PERSON	to know the reason , he told them that two of his men the night before were sent on shore upon some errand , and had not returned , added , that he was confident the inhabitants knew where they were , and that they were detained by them purposely , the two gentlemen declared themselves ignorant of the matter , and believed the whole town to be , however , to pacify Capt.
Ayscough	PERSON	, they assured him that they would summon the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	together , enquire into the affair , & c. withall , desiring Capt.
Ayscough	PERSON	to write a letter to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, stating his grievance ; this he did , and they promised to wait on him with an answer in the afternoon : As the Captain 's letter was rather in the threatning stile , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	could not help enquiring what he meant thereby , and assured him in their reply , that they were not to be intimidated , and did not think themselves by any means , accountable for the desertion of any of his men .

		Captain
Ayscough	PERSON	read the letter with considerable composure , folded it up , and then gave it to -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	, Captain of the
Rose	PERSON	-LRB- Ayscough at this time being on board
Wallace	PERSON	's ship -RRB- Captain
Wallace	PERSON	immediately flew into a most terrible passion , threw the letter down in a violent fit of rage , damn 'd the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, & c. swore at
Ayscough	LOCATION	for writing to such a damn 'd parcel of rebels and declared that if he knew the two gentlemen who were then present to be of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, they should never go a-shore again ; they endeavoured to pacify him but in vain , he swore repeatedly that if there was a God in Heaven , the town should be destroyed before morning , that he was a King 's officer , and would not be insulted , & c. Hereupon the two gentlemen left the ship .

		A signal gun was instantly discharged , and the three pirates in the harbour and their tender immediately weighed anchor and came close in with the town , their tomkins were out , the marines on board beat up to arms , and all the hostile preparations imaginable going forward against a defenceless seaport , consisting -LRB- exclusive of the men -RRB- of not less than 6000 women and children .

		About half past nine in the evening a cannon was discharged from the Rose , when many really thought the firing on the town was begun , several women fainted away , others went into fits , and a few absolutely miscarried by the fright , in short , there was the greatest apparent distress !

		-LRB- The cannon which was fired was loaded with powder only . -RRB-

		Between the hours of ten and eleven , the same night , a ' packet from
Providence	LOCATION	arrived with seven or eight passengers , she was stopt and a place appointed for her near the Swan , the passengers were seized , made to tell all their names , and confined as prisoners , repeatedly stiled rebels , with the most horrid oaths annexed , a guard with drawn swords kept over them during the night , the late infamous proclamation of a truce breaking -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, was hung close by them , which they were fearful they would be compelled to sign or else abide the consequence therein denounced .

		It is worthy of observation , that during the period the three Captains were together on board the Rose , playing cards , drinking , carousing , & c .

		About one or two o'clock next morning , viz. .

		Wednesday , one of the Swan 's men returned , and in order , it is supposed to save himself from a flogging , as it was necessary for him to give some account of himself , he invented the following lye and swore to it upon the Holy Evangelists , namely , `` That the
Rhode-Island	LOCATION	rebels had taken him and his companion and wanted that they should enlist among them to fight against the King , but that they refused , and because they did that the rebels gagged them and then carried them to
Providence	LOCATION	gaol , but that he broke away and travelled thirty miles to get on board again , with much of the same stuff . ''

		The Captains of the pirates either believed this gross and inconsistent falsehood , or fain would make the inhabitants think so ; accordingly it was taken down in writing , sent on shore and satisfaction demanded , or the town should certainly be laid in ashes that very day .

		Another cannon was now discharged , four ferry-boats and two wood sloops seized , quantities of tar and other inflammatory and combustible matter put into the same , in order to set on fire and send into the wharves , as a more expeditious way of destroying the town than by cannon only ; the cannon at the same time were to be fired on every part of the town ; the Court-house , Dr.
Stiles	PERSON	's Meeting-house , and the Printing-office were first of all to feel the effects of this horrid plot .

		The most terrible parade was kept up by these low ministerial tools till near two o'clock P.M. when two persons of undoubted veracity -LRB- farmers , within two or three miles of the town -RRB- went on board the Swan : One of these gentlemen assured the Captains of the three ships , that he saw the stragglers , for whose desertion such terrible confusion had ensued , in his corn field on Tuesday morning , and described them ; the other gentleman declared that he saw them on Tuesday afternoon where he was making hay , and likewise described them , for they told these gentlemen how they had made their escape from the Swan , and were determined not to go back again .

		After fully proving that they knew the men , by pointing out the one who had returned , notwithstanding four others were first produced in order to deceive them , they , viz. the two gentlemen , came on shore ; when , all at once , the boats and prisoners were dismissed , the ships weighed anchor and stood up the 1 .

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM LORD
WM CAMPBELL	ORGANIZATION	TO THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH DATED CHARLES TOWN 19th JULY , 1775 ー '' 1 -LRB- COPY -RRB- On the 8th Instant we had Accounts of another Engagement near
Boston	LOCATION	: I enclose the printed Paper published here , to give your Lordship an Idea of the kind of Intelligence that is circulated with unremitting Industry round this Part of the Continent : Nineteen out of Twenty firmly believe it ; and I can not express the Mischief it does If General
Gage	PERSON	from what I have already wrote does not see the Necessity of favouring us with some Account of his proceedings , and the Admiral the propriety of having a respectable Naval Force on this Coast , it will give me real Concern , as I every day find of what detriment it is to His Majesty 's Service , to be so completely abandoned as we are .

		Every hour I have the Mortification of hearing of Vessels from the Dutch and French Settlements arriving , and smuggling their Cargoes in the neighbouring Creeks ; and three Schooners that were loaded with Rice a few days before my Arrival , and sent to Hispaniola for the professed purpose of bringing back
Military Stores	ORGANIZATION	, are every moment expected .

		The intollerable Tyranny and Oppression used by the Committees in enforceing their Mandates , has already given Offence to the moderate of their own
Party	ORGANIZATION	; and has stirred up such a Spirit in the back Parts of this Country , which is very populous , that I hope it will be attended with the best Effects ... The
Committee and Council of Safety	ORGANIZATION	sit Night and Day .

		I am told they are debating about seizing the Kings Officers , and those few who have not signed the
Association	ORGANIZATION	, and boldly changing the Government at once .

		I have just received an anonimous Letter assuring me they have determined to destroy the
Light House	ORGANIZATION	, and cut down the land Mark Trees , that direct the Pilots in passing the Bar of this
Harbour	PERSON	.

		But that will answer little End in preventing Men of War , as they can sound and lay Buoys along the Channel ; and besides Mr.
-LSB- John -RSB- Tollemache	PERSON	carried off in the Scorpion to
Boston	LOCATION	, a black Fellow who is by far the best Pilot in this
Harbour	LOCATION	, and has Marks of his own by which he will carry in any Vessel in spite of what they can do .

		Your Lordship will easily conceive the Distress of my present Situation , and how very uncertain my personl safety is , but as I know my Presence embarrasses them , I am determined at all Events to remain to the last Extremity , and see what they dare do .

		To publish Proclamations against their Proceedings , would be only giving them an opportunity of pouring fresh Insults on Government ; but could I only keep my Ground , till General
Gage	PERSON	enables me to publish an Account of a Severe Correction given to the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	People , and till the Admiral recollects the Situation we must be in to the Southward , and sends us some little Force , I am still in Hopes our Heroes here might come to their Senses .

JOHN MURRAY	PERSON	TO
JAMES OTIS	PERSON	, PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF
MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	BAY 1 Sir ,
Boothbay	PERSON	July 20th 1775 I took the liberty , by last Post , of acquainting the late Honble .

		Congriss , of some things that appeared indispensible to the keeping possession of the greatest part of the County of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	Since that time , an express from the
Committee of Campden	ORGANIZATION	bro ' t me the disagreeable news , that the extreme indigence of the inhabitants of that settlement had induced many of them for sake of obtaining provisions to trade off their lumber to the Emissaries of Genl -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	; & that the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	was not able to remove this evil ; praying advice ; I opened the modes prescribed for relief in such a case ; & recommended them to some neighbouring Towns : Application was made a few days after .

		by the Comee of a town near me for some directions for their proceedings with a certain trader from
Nantuckett	LOCATION	to whom another
Committee	ORGANIZATION	had given a permit to load for that Island ; the sight of the 1st Resolve -LRB- which was all I then had -RRB- greatly surprized them : Major
Andrew Reed	PERSON	of this town immediately mustered a party , went to
Edgecumbs	LOCATION	, seized the vessel , & brought it into this harbour where the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	ordered her to be unloaded ー took bonds of the Capt that he would return to
Nantuckett	PERSON	empty ー & so dismissed her ; this conduct of theirs has been much censured ー inasmuch as the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in
Kennebec River	LOCATION	allowed five sloops , from the same
Island	LOCATION	, in the same week , to load & go off unmolested ー they therefore pray the judgment & further orders of your Honble Court : On this Occasion I beg leave to remark that , when any Comees are found faulty ー they commonly plead that they had never seen nor known of the Resolves in point : to remove this excuse I would humbly Query whether it would not be necessary to publish every order & c that requires their execution , in hand bills ; & take order for having them , with speed & certainty conveyed to these distant parts ?

		& 2 .

		whether it would not be proper to continue the post-ridings at least as far as
St. Georges	LOCATION	, or direct each town speedily to convey the bills to the next on some proper penalty ?

		This afternoon the Minister & five of the inhabitants of
Deer Island	LOCATION	arrived at my house , express with the alarming news that a Man of War of twenty guns four large transports & three sloops have landed a number of Marines on Long island near
Fort Pownal	LOCATION	where they now are encamped , for the protection of the vessels & c while they are to bring in a load of wood -LRB- of which 't is said Capt
Pendleton	PERSON	had 1000 cord ready for them , on his landing-place -RRB- also a quantity of fresh meat , for which they offer a pistareen pr pound ー envoys are sent thro ' the Country with written demands of provisions promising good pay for all they receive & threatning to take by force what they ca n't obtain by wile : after they have finished this business , 't is expected they will se -LSB- nd -RSB- to nestle at
Fort Pownal	LOCATION	: where the people in general imagine they are permitted by Col.
-LSB- Thomas -RSB- Goldthwait	PERSON	ー Major -LSB-
Nathan -RSB- Jones	PERSON	of
Goldsborough	PERSON	and thirty of the inhabitants at
Majabigwaduse	LOCATION	; who , since the battle at
Charlestown	LOCATION	, have avowed a resolution of supplying the enemy : what pity is it that fortress is yet standing !

		warning , early enough , was given to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	about it .

		The enemy it seems bring their wives-childrin , & all the necessaries for quarters , along with them : The people in these parts are in great anxiety & distress ; but all in motion ; tho ' almost quite destitute of powder-money-provisions & every thing the Express desires some help both in men & all the articles above : I immediately dispatched Messengers to the Colonels of the two Regiments of Militia in this County , and believe they will march large detachments of both , tomorrow : but we shall now begin to feel the mischiefs that must accrue to the Country from the draughting our best men & best arms to the Camp ー the Sorry remains are in ill condition to meet an enemy ー and what with 150 men to defend this extensive shore .

		I think the Country must be evacuated , unless more companies be stationed on the
Sea Coast	LOCATION	.

		& unless the wisdom of the Honble .

		-LSB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- devise some means of supplying the inhabitants , as well as the Companies to be stationed in this County both with ammunition & the necessaries of life .

		The extreme hurry of my Situation , I hope will be my apology for the Confusion of this letter ; as I hardly know what is said , & what left unsaid and have time neither to revise nor correct ー I tho ' t it best to send the Express forward to wait on the
Honble Court	ORGANIZATION	; as I could better acquaint you of the particulars of our alarming situation than a letter would admit ー if it is not made the source of some early exertion of Government , I fear t , he people will be discouraged , & before the temptation now laid in their way ー & if so , that the enemy will obtain lodgment from which it will be no easy matter to expell them .

		On the side of the Enemy , they have also been very industrious in finishing their Lines both on Bunker 's
Hill	PERSON	and

		In this interval also their Transports have arrived from

		Some Times I have suspected an .

		Intention of detaching part of their Army to some part of the Coast , as they have been building a number of Flat Bottomed Boats capable of holding 200 Men each .

		But from their Works and the Languge held at
Boston	LOCATION	there is reason to think they expect an attack from us and are principally engaged in preparin ' g against it .

		I have ordered all the Whale Boats for many miles along the Coast to be collected and some of them are employed every Night to watch the motion of the Enemy by water , in order to guard as much as possible against any surprize .

JOSIAH MARTIN	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF
NORTH CAROLINA	LOCATION	, TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 My Lord , Cruizer Sloop of War in
Cape Fear River	LOCATION	, No .


Carolina	LOCATION	, July 20th , 1775 .

		I have embrassed the moment only that the immediate departure of a Vessel affords me to acquaint your Lordship that I received about 9 o'clock at night on the 18th inst .

		a letter signed `` The People , '' by the hands of a Pilot who confessed he received it from Mr
John Ashe	PERSON	, a copy of which letter and of my answer thereto I have the honor herewith to lay before your Lordship .

		At between 2 and 3 o'clock the next morning an officer of the Cruizer came down to the Cabin where I was to inform Captain -LSB-
Francis -RSB- Parry	PERSON	that Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Collet	PERSON	's house in
Fort Johnston	LOCATION	was on fire .

		The necessary preparations were immediately made for the Security of His Majesty 's Ship and covering the Artillery on shore in case the People should attempt to possess themselves of it , during which no creature was to be seen and all the buildings in the
Fort	LOCATION	, which being of wood burnt like tinders , were entirely consumed .

		Early in the morning of yesterday a body of Men with three stands of colours were seen in motion on a point of land about 2 miles above the Ship , which soon afterwards entered the Woods and disappeared , until between 7 and 8 o'clock when we discovered a large party at some distance , and some lesser parties about the Fort which a few of the People soon afterwards entered and with a degree of wanton malice not to be described set fire to everything that had escaped the flames the preceding night , which indeed was nothing but a Centry Box , and some of the Parapets of wood work that Captain
Collet	PERSON	had newly raised upon the defences of the place .

		These proceedings however to the last degree violent , extravagant and provoking , I did not think My Lord of consequence sufficient to justify me in commencing hostilities against the People so long as they forebore to touch the King 's Artillery , as I had no men to land I could do it with so little effect , and as all the material damage that the Fort could sustain had been effected in the night by persons yet undiscovered .

		Some of the Trucks of the Gun carriages , which owing to Captain
Collet	PERSON	's oversight , were not embarked as I directed with the shot and other small Stores , the rabble removed four or five hundred yards from where they lay and left them .

		These I hope to recover today and get them on Board Ship .

		After sauntering about the Fort and its neighborhood till between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon , this rabble which amounted as nearly as I can learn to about 300 men , with a savage and barbarian wantonness , disgracefull to humanity , set fire to a large barn , stable and coach house , and a new small dwelling house together with several outhouses that Captain
Collet	PERSON	had built for his own convenience on the King 's Land belonging to the Fort , without the works , and immediately after completing this desolation retired by the route they came .

		The pretence for these shamefull and extravagant outrages is annamosity to Captain
Collet	PERSON	, whose zeal for the
King 's Service	ORGANIZATION	, and natural vehemence and impetuosity of temper , I fear have transported him to some great indiscretions , but I am confident to no violences that can justify such barbarian vengeance .

		Mr
John Ashe	PERSON	and Mr
Cornelius Harnett	PERSON	were ringleaders of this savage and audacious Mob , concerning which my present information enables me to add nothing further .

John Sloss	PERSON	-RSB-
Hobart	LOCATION	laid before the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	a Letter from the
Committee of Safety for the Colony of New-York	ORGANIZATION	in the recess of the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, dated
New York	LOCATION	, July 14 , 1775 , directed to him , containing information that
George Youngs	PERSON	and his son ,
John Brush	PERSON	, and one -LSB-
Cornelius -RSB- Conkling	PERSON	, were concerned in Provisions in such manner as they must inevitably serve to supply General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	's Fleet and
Army	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	; and inclosing notes taken from two witnesses on that subject , which were read .

		Messrs.
Youngs	PERSON	, Brush and
Conkling	PERSON	being present , acknowledged that they had sent two Sloops loaded with Provisions to the eastward , but it was in consequence of an agreement with the inhabitants of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, in New-Hampshire ; that upon their arrival in the harbour of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, they were taken by two English men-of-war ; and though Governor -LSB-
John -RSB- Wentworth	PERSON	and the
Committee of the Town	ORGANIZATION	claimed the Provision as theirs by contract , they were sent , very much against their inclination , to
Boston	LOCATION	, where they were obliged to sell their Provisions under great disadvantages , and at a great loss ; since which they have discontinued their trade to the eastward , nor have they at present any thoughts of resuming it .

		2 In confirmation of all which , they produced
Timothy Titus	PERSON	, who was mate of one of the sloops , who deposed as follows , viz :
Timothy Titus	PERSON	deposeth : that he was mate of the
Sloop Elizabeth	PERSON	, whereof
Cornelius Conkling	PERSON	was master , for the two voyages she lately made to
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, in
New-Hampshire	LOCATION	; that about the latter end of April last , being at
Portsmouth	ORGANIZATION	aforesaid , when
John Conkling	PERSON	, in a sloop loaded by
John Brush of Huntington	PERSON	, was there , he was knowing to a contract made by the said
Cornelius Conkling	PERSON	and
John Conkling	PERSON	, with the Inhabitants of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, to deliver two cargoes of Provisions there , with all convenient speed , provided they could clear out from New-York ; that on the 18th of May following , said two sloops sailed from the east end of
Long-Island	LOCATION	, and on the 21st they arrived within a few hours of each other in
Portsmouth	LOCATION	harbour , where they were taken by the Canceaux and
Scarborough	PERSON	men-of-war ; and notwithstanding the application of
Governour Wentworth	LOCATION	and the
Committee of Portsmouth	ORGANIZATION	, they were sent to
Boston	LOCATION	under convoy of the Sphynx sloop-of-war , where they were obliged to sell their cargoes at the price the agents were pleased to give ; after which they were permitted to come away .

		And this deponent further saith , he has never heard any persons concerned in the aforesaid voyage propose to send their sloops upon another voyage to the eastward .

		Timothy Titus Sworn the 21st July , 1775 Before me ,
John Sloss Hobart	PERSON	, Justice of the Peace .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	taking the premises into consideration , came to the following Resolution , viz : Resolved unanimously , That the said
Youngs	PERSON	and his son , Brush and
Conkling	PERSON	in this matter have not contravened the
Association	ORGANIZATION	, nor in any wise disobeyed the recommendations of the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	or
Provincial Congresses	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whereas , it appears that great uneasiness prevails in the minds of many people upon this subject , arising from a laudable zeal to prevent any Provisions being sent to the instruments of tyranny and oppression at
Boston	LOCATION	, Ordered , That the parties concerned be allowed a copy of the Minutes for publication .

		Accordingly a neighbouring Company headed by their Capt. , and a number of others went on board and set fire to both Ship & Cargo , which in a few Hours were consumed .

		Every thing , I am informed , was destroyed , except some Cheese belonging to the Commander , he having about 50 in number , 20 of which they permitted to savg .

		The Ship had not long , been burning , before the magnanimous Baltimoreans arrived with a professed Design to execute the glorious Deed , in which they had been anticipated .

		They brought the owner 's Son with them from
Baltimore	LOCATION	, that he might share a Stewarts Fate .

John Collett	PERSON	, commander of
Fort Johnston	LOCATION	, was preparing the said fort for the reception of a promised reinforcement , which was to be employed in reducing the good people of this province , to a slavish submission to the will of a wicked and tyrannic Minister ; and for this diabolical purpose , had collected several abandoned profligates , whose crimes had rendered them unworthy of civil society ; and that the said commander , had wantonly detained vessels applying for
Bills of Health	ORGANIZATION	, thereby defeating the salutary purposes for which the
Fort	ORGANIZATION	had been established and continued ー had threatened vengeance against magistrates , whose official opinion he chose to disapprove ー had set at defiance the high sheriff of the county , in the execution of his office , and treated the King 's writs , when served on him for just debts -LRB- which both as a soldier and a subject , it was his duty to obey -RRB- with the shameful contempt of wiping his b -- k s-de with them ー had with the most unparalleled injustice , detained and embezzled a large quantity of goods , which having been wrecked near the
Fort	LOCATION	, had the highest claim to his attention and care , for the benefit of the sufferers ; in whose behalf , many and repeated applications had been legally made , in vain , to the said commander ー had contrary to every principle of honor and honesty , most unwarrantably seized , by force , a quantity of corn , the private property of an individual ; an act of robbery the more inexcusable , as provisions were never withheld from him , whenever he would pay for them ー had basely encouraged slaves from their masters , paid and employed them , and declared openly , that he would excite them to an insurrection : It also appeared that the said
John Collett	PERSON	, had further declared , that , as soon as the expected reinforcements should arrive , the King 's standard would be erected , and that , to it should be invited all those -LRB- as well slaves as others -RRB- who were base enough to take up arms against their country .

		The
Committee of New Hanover	ORGANIZATION	and
Wilrnington	LOCATION	, having taken these things into consideration , judged it might be of the most pernicious consequences to the people at large , if the said
John Collett	PERSON	should be suffered to remain in the Fort , as he might thereby have opportunity of carrying his iniquitous schemes into execution .

		This opinion having been communicated to the officers , and the committees of some neighboring counties , a great many volunteers were immediately collected ; a party of whom reached
Brunswick	LOCATION	, when accounts were received , that the said commander had carried off all the small arms , ammunition , and part of the Artillery , -LRB- the property of the Province -RRB- together with his furniture , on board a Transport , hired for that purpose , there to remain until the reinforcement should arrive , and then again take possession of the Fort : the original design being thus frustrated , but the different detachments having met at
Brunswick	LOCATION	, about 500 men marched to the Fort , and burnt and destroyed all the Houses , & c. , in and about the same ; demolished as far as they could , the back part of the Fortification , and effectually dislodged that atrocious Freebooter .

		Resolved , therefore , thacthe thanks of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	be given to the officers and soldiers who , with such ready alacrity gave their attendance to effect a matter of so much real importance to the public .

Providence	LOCATION	has ordered the Ministry to be so over sighted as Not to attack the weakest Colonies first that are fill 'd with internal Enemies , whose Assistance woud have greatly facilitated the Execution of their hellish Schemes I ca n't help hoping that providence will continue its kindness in suffering the Necessities of Thousands the love of Justice of Many & the true old brittish Spirit of numbers warmly attached to the just & free principles of the Constitution to rouse timely enough to afford us Reliefー Is it not to be -LSB- hop -RSB- ed too that

		I Return you the same Certificates Signd by Several other Members of the Committee ,
Shou	PERSON	'd you in future receive certificates Sign 'd by myself only whilst I continue Chairman you may regard them as Sufficient .

		The convening a Number of our Committee on every occasion that requires Certificates for goods Sold here wou 'd be an endless Trouble.ー It has always been understood here that Mr.
Johnson Gildart	PERSON	was and is Attorney in Fact for his Father
James Gildart	PERSON	but how far he is otherwise connected with him as a Factor Agent or Partner is unknown to me or Such of the

		I had the Honor to receive your Letter of yesterday acquainting Me that petitions had been preferred to your Excellency by
Simeon Turner	PERSON	,
Isaac Elwell	PERSON	and
James Jordan	PERSON	, Masters of Coasting Vessels complaining of being detained and thereby disenabled to bring Us those Supplies we are in Extreme want of ; that the two latter say their Cargoes are taken from them without any Account rendered , and that they have otherwise greatly suffered .

		If our Supplies are to come by the way of Cape
Ann Harbour	PERSON	, the complaint of
Elwell	PERSON	and
Jordan	LOCATION	is most certainly just ; for one was cut out of the
Harbour	LOCATION	where he was at Anchor , the other taken upon the point of going in ;
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's Vessel was with difficulty prevented from getting into
Salem	LOCATION	.

		ー I hope , therefore , it appears plain to your Excellency that these Cargoes of Wood were not intended to come to
Boston	LOCATION	, but were for the Use of -LSB- the -RSB- Rebels ; And that to grant their Masters the Indulgence your Excellency desires would operate directly to our prejudice by encouraging Men , inclined from principle , to Supply our Enemies .

		Their Vessels and Cargoes therefore are , in my opinion , very justly ordered to be libelled and prosecuted to Condemnation .

		2 It gives Me Much uneasiness that your Excellency Considers the Seizure and detention of these Vessels to be improper , And I shall be extremely Concerned if , thereby , any intended supplies are prevented from Coming to Us ; All such as are inclined to Supply Us pass without the least Molestation , Witness several that have lately Come in , and departed again ー My orders are expressly to this Effect , but at the same time to seize whatever is evidently going into other Ports , which I think is agreeable to your Excellency 's request .

		I most earnestly desire to assure you that anxiously solicitous to co-operate with your Excellency , and to carry on the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	in my department in the Most satisfactory Manner , I am perticularly unhappy when untoward circumstances occasion My endeavours to have a contrary effect .

		It would give me the highest satisfaction by any Means in My power not only to relieve the present distresses , but to Contribute in guarding against threatned Evils ; And I will readily and thankfully receive any information for these or any other purposes of Government that your Excellency can occasionaly give Me ; being equally inclined to give every encouragement to those who are willing to assist Us , and to punish every one , who at this time shall dare to Supply the Rebels .

Shaw	PERSON	burst in a Window and enter 'd & Tuppham after him ; the Men in the mean time being properly Station 'd .

		They expected to have catch 'd some Tories there , but found none of any Note .

		Our People came on so secretely that they were not known to be on the
Island	LOCATION	untill they enter 'd the
House	ORGANIZATION	; they demanded of the Man who was in the
House	ORGANIZATION	`` what People were on the Island ? ''

		and were answer 'd that a number were in the Barn who had been sent from
Boston	LOCATION	to cut the Hay & make it .

		Upon which our People enter 'd the Barn and seiz 'd them all Prisoners before they knew they were in danger .

		Among the Prisoners in the
House	ORGANIZATION	was a Lady perhaps une Fille de joie , who pretended to be on the point of Marriage with a Capt of one of the Transports .

		15 Prisoners , abt 30 Cattle , a Horse , and abt 100 Sheep , were brot off that Night undiscover 'd .

		Next morning about 10
Whale Boats	ORGANIZATION	went on again in broad Day , from
Dorchester	LOCATION	to Burn the Barns & Hay on the Island -LRB- suppos 'd to be abt 70 Ton -RRB- these Boats were discover 'd immediately by the Men of War which surrounded the Island , and Barges & Cutters were sent to cut them off .

		Our People , however , burnt the
House & Barns	ORGANIZATION	and got off without a Man being Kill 'd or wounded in the Boats or on the Island tho ' a most heavy fire was Kept up from the Men of War from above & below the Island whose Shot both ways swep ' t across the
Island	LOCATION	where our Men were , and tho ' our Boats were pursue 'd by the Barges & Tenders continually firing on them so near that they were sure of taking a number of our Boats as they tho ` t , yet we escap 'd .

		Capt -LSB-
Jacob -RSB- Gould	PERSON	of
Weymouth	LOCATION	, who was most expos 'd , was told by the Officer of the Man of War to `` yield for he was his Prisoner , ''
Gould	PERSON	answer 'd `` not yet '' and discharg 'd his Musquet full at him , and encouraging his Men to pull up , he escap 'd with the Skin of his Teeth .

		When some of our foremost Men were landed at the Head of the Moon , they fir 'd briskly on the Enemy 's Barges , and kept them off so as to secure the landing of the hindermost which were so hotly pursued .

		In this engagement one of our Men -LRB- Mr
Clarke	PERSON	of
Stoughton	LOCATION	-RRB- was Kill 'd .

		Another Expedition has been from hence to Nantaskett & the
Light House	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not many Days ago a small Man of War drew up close to the Houses at
Nantaskett	LOCATION	within the
Gutt	PERSON	, and afterwards paraded it by coming up as far as Pig Rocks by
Hoffs Neck	PERSON	and then lying off
Hingham Cove	LOCATION	-LSB- blurred -RSB- , and then returning to
Nantaskett	PERSON	again .

		These movements made our People conclude that the Man of War was sent to secure to -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	's
Army	ORGANIZATION	, the Grain then ready to cutt on the lands at
Nantaskett	LOCATION	; especially as the Barge had seiz 'd Mr
Milton	PERSON	of Nantaskett & his Cart and Oxen and carried him & his Oxen to the Admiral , where the Oxen were kept but the Man after much examination releas 'd .

		Under this perswasion , last Tuesday Night -LSB- July 18 -RSB- our men from
Germantown	LOCATION	and the neighbouring shore to the amount of abt 400 , Guards , Mowers & c pass 'd over to
Hingham	LOCATION	in Boats , and from thence by land to
Nantaskett	LOCATION	, having engag 'd a number of Carts to come over the long Beach .

		They with great expedition mow 'd and sent off the Grain to the amount of 70 Cart Load , and having done that , on Thursday morning a Company commanded by Majr -LSB-
Joseph -RSB- Vose	PERSON	of
Milton	PERSON	, went over to the
Light House	ORGANIZATION	, took down and bro ' t off the Lamps , brot off 1 Barrell of Gun Powder , severall Tierces of Oil , a quantity of old Cordage , Severall Boats & c and then Burnt the Light House , -LRB- but not the
Dwelling House	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- then returning to
Nantaskett	LOCATION	they found that the Burning of the L :
House	ORGANIZATION	had alarm 'd the Men of War , and that their Barges & Cutters were sent down to attack our People , which they accordingly did , 7 of their Barges being lash 'd together for that Purpose .

		A Hot Fire ensu 'd for near an Hour but none of our Men were Kill 'd and only two wounded ; Our People try 'd to draw them on Shore by seeming to run from them , but to no purpose , the men-of-War 's - men seem 'd evidently afraid to come near them ; and at last put off so as to be out of the reach of our Musquetts .

		When Mr
Milton	PERSON	was carried on board the Admiral , he examin 'd him very strictly about the Whale Boats that lately appear 'd in the
Harbour	LOCATION	, what their Number was ?

		where they were kept ?

		whether he could Pilot his People to them & c ?

		To all which he made such answers as gave the great Man no Satisfaction , especially when he told him that he understood that our People kept the Whale Boats drawn up into the Woods .

		I fear you will be tir 'd with the length of this Scrawl unless reliev 'd by believing it to be design 'd for your amusement , by your most affectionate Brorー R -LSB- ichard -RSB- C -LSB- ranch -RSB- 1 .

Boston	LOCATION	July 24th 1775 Separate Very great Pains have been taken to starve the Troops and the Friends of Government in
Boston	LOCATION	, for no Article Necessary for the Support of Life is Suffered to be Sent there from any of the Provinces from New-Hampshire to
South Carolina	LOCATION	, and in most of the Sea-Ports Persons are appointed to examine everything that is embarked and where it is going .

		They endeavor to prevent also the Fishermen from Supplying the Town with Fish , by means of Whale-Boats that they have Seized at
Nantucket	LOCATION	, and have lately in those Boats destroyed the
Light House	ORGANIZATION	off
Cape-Ann	LOCATION	and at the Entrance of this
Harbour	LOCATION	, to deceive Ships bound in here .

		The King 's Ships have Sent in a few Vessels laden with Flour and other Articles which affords some Relief to the Troops , tho ' we hoped for more ample Supplys thro ' their Means , as the Inhabitants begin to feel some Distress .

		It was found upon a further Enquiry about the State of
Fort William	LOCATION	and
Mary	PERSON	, in
New-Hampshire	LOCATION	that the light Pieces and Ammunition was what the People chiefly had carried away from the Fort , and that most part of the heavy Artillery had been left .

		Upon this Advice a large Transport under the Protection of a Ship of War was sent to Secure the Ordnance remaining in said Fort , and I enclose your Lordship a List thereof ; which was brought away , and part of it is sent home in an
Artillery Transport	ORGANIZATION	.

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	24 July 1775 Sir As it may appear extraordinary that the Rebels should demand and quietly obtain the money in the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, belonging to the Province of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, I think it necessary to inclose an Extract of a Letter from Captain -LSB-
Andrew -RSB- Barkley	PERSON	on the Subject , that their Lordships may be satisfied the money might have been deposited on board the
Scarborough	PERSON	if Governor -LSB-
John -RSB- Wentworth	PERSON	had thought it proper , and that his Excellency had been often applied to for that purpose .

		Since my Letter July 16 the Pilot of the
Margueritta	LOCATION	armed Schooner returned to
Boston	LOCATION	: I inclose his Account of the Transaction , together with an Affidavit of another Person received from Governor
Legge	PERSON	at
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		As it is confidently reported that Rebel armed Vessels , from
Mechias	LOCATION	and other places , are cruizing to intercept the Supplies of Cattle and Provisions we endeavour to draw from the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	; I have ordered the St.
Lawrence	PERSON	and Hope Schooners on that coast , with Orders to sink , burn and destroy these Pyrates or any aiding or assisting , wherever they can be found .

		The Schooners take under their
Convoy two Transport Brigs for Annapolis Royal	ORGANIZATION	, and they or the
Senegal	LOCATION	are to return with the Transports , and several others now waiting at
Windsor	LOCATION	for Convoy .

		I inclose a Copy of Intelligence that the Lighthouse on Thatchers Island , generally known by the name of
Cape Anne Lights	LOCATION	, are destroyed .

		And on the 20th some Rebels in Whale Boats went from
Nantasket	LOCATION	in a Calm and set fire to
Boston Lighthouse	LOCATION	which is at present rendered useless .

		The Rebels have collected near three hundred Whale Boats in the different Creeks round this
Harbour	LOCATION	, and begin to make little Expeditions to the
Islands	LOCATION	.

		A few days ago one hundred and five Boats , full of men , landed on
Long Island	LOCATION	and carried off all the Stock .

		One of their party was a Seaman belonging to the Falcon , taken in
Buzzards Bay	LOCATION	, as related in my Letter June 16 .

		This Man was placed
Centinel	PERSON	, but concealed himself till the Rebels had left the
Island	LOCATION	, and then swam to a Canoe lying off , and by that means got on board the
Boyne	LOCATION	.

		His Report confirms what we before heard of the number of Whale Boats .

		From their Lightness and drawing little Water , they can not only outrow our Boats , but by getting into Shoal Water , and in Calms , they must constantly escape .

		It is not possible to guard every
Island	LOCATION	in this Harbour from such pyratical attempts without more armed Vessels and Men than can be had .

		Various are the Conjectures about the Design of the Rebels in bringing so great a number of Whale boats here , Robbing the
Islands	LOCATION	and burning the Houses and Hay thereon most certainly distresses the Garrison by depriving them of fresh Meat , Vegetables , Milk , Fruit and many other Advantages ; but it is generally believed they were principally intended to land a Body of Men in the Night at the most defenceless parts of the Town , when a general attack should be made on the Lines , hoping , with the assistance of disaffected people in the Town , to occasion great confusion and terror and finally defeat his Majesty 's Troops .

		Others are of opinion that in a calm Night they mean to surprize one of the Frigates of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	and carry her by suddenly pouring in great Numbers of People .

		And this leads me to mention that the very low Complements of his Majestys Ships at present make the Duty extremely hard in this
Harbour	PERSON	.

		We are obliged to keep a number of Men and Officers in flat bottomed floating Battery Boats , placed in Shoal Water , to flank
Boston and Charles Town Necks	ORGANIZATION	; To man an armed Transport and a Sloop ; and occasionally to lend men to the Transports ordered on Service , instead of theirs who desert .

		In the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, the Frigates , Sloops and Schooners are seldom without lent Men on board .

		These Draughts are from the three large Ships , who by that means are sometimes unavoidably left in a weak and almost defenceless Condition .

		I beg leave likewise to observe that the 20 Gun Ships and Sloops with their present low Complement of Men are Objects of the Rebels attention , who in their large Schooners and Sloops fancy they shall succeed by boarding when the Kings Ship is at anchor .

		I am & c.

NEWPORT MERCURY	LOCATION	, MONDAY , JULY 24 , 1775
Newport	LOCATION	, July 24 .

		From last Tuesday -LSB- July 18 -RSB- about 2 o'clock , till near the same hour on the next day , this town was threatened to be fired upon from the three ships of war in this harbour , viz. the Rose , Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	, the Swan , Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Ayscough	PERSON	, and -LSB- the -RSB- King fisher , Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	, and also a tender : ー for which purpose these ships were brought close in with the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	part of the town , on Tuesday towards night ; their tampkins -LSB- sic !

		tampions -RSB- were immediately taken out , and all the apparent preparations made for cannonading this town , which greatly terrified the women and children , especially those women who were with child .

		In the evening lanthorns and men were placed at the guns , and the most hostile appearance kept up , which twas possible for them to exhibit , and many women and children were running about , wringing their hands and crying in the greatest distress : ー About half past 9 , a cannon was discharged from the Rose , when the women really thought the firing on the town was begun , many of whom fainted away , and went into fits , and a number , we are told , absolutely miscarried by the fright .

		ー However this gun was loaded with powder only , and the men of war gave out to a number of persons , whom they had stopped coming down the river , that they should not beat the town down till next morning , when they would certainly do it .

		ー In the morning the like terrific scene was opened by firing another cannon , and seizing on four ferry-boats , a passage boat , with a number of passengers , and two wood sloops ; the Swan moved down to the south part of the town , where she anchored with her guns pointing diagonally across the wharfs , so as to rake from thence up to the Parade and Court-house ; here again all the tampkins were out , quantities of tar and other inflammatory and combustible matter were put into the ferry-boats , in order , as was said to set on fire , and send into the town to burn it , as a more expeditious way of destroying the town , than by cannon only .

		At the same time that these boats were to be sent into the town , a number of men were to be landed at the south-end , to set fire to that part .

		Thus the most warlike and hostile parade was kept up to the highest degree , till near two o'clock on Wednesday ; when , all at once , the boats were discharged , the ships weighed anchor and stood up the river .

		ー The same evening the
Rose	PERSON	got ashore on the north part of this island ; but by taking out her guns , & c. she was got off , and the next day they all came down again to their old station .

		We know not of even the shadow of a just reason for the above inhuman conduct ; if the Captains of said ships have any reason to offer we should be very glad to publish them to the world : The story about two of the Swan 's people being seized by a mob in town , gagged , carried to
Bristol	LOCATION	gaol , & c. had it not been absolutely disproved , would have been a most wretched pretext for firing on a defenceless town , in which there were not less than six thousand women and children.ー N.B. .

		It must have been well known to the commanders of those ships , that there was not a single cannon in this town mounted for its defence .

		The above three ships and tender are this morning going out , supposed on a cruize .

		1 1 .

		The journal of
James Wallace	PERSON	, of the
Rose	PERSON	, is silent upon the subject of this threatened bombardment .

		There is no mention of it , other than that the ship was abreast of the town .

		The journals of the Swan and Kingsfisher are a bit more illuminating .

		The former , for July 19 , 1775 , reads : `` A M at 6 Sent the Long Boat and Pinnace to weigh the Stream Anchor 1/2 past got it on Board at 7 Sent a warp out to the Fort wharfe & hove up the small Br & Dropt further to the So ward at 9 Dropt the small Br & moord ship with the Stream Cable with Spring on & abreast of the Town People employed Clearing the Ship for Battering the Town -LSB- P M -RSB- got the Guns over and secured them . ''

		The
Kingsfisher	PERSON	's journal reads : `` Anchored with Bt Br abreast Town ... wth
Rose	PERSON	and Swan all hands at Qrs Carried out the
Kedge Anchor	LOCATION	to Stedy the Ship hauled our Broadside A Breast the Town . ''

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM AN OFFICER OF THE FLEET '' 1
Boston	LOCATION	, July 25 , 1775 The blockade of
Boston	LOCATION	, having occasioned a great scarcity of every thing , tenders were fitted and dispatched from every ship ; and Mr.
James Moore	PERSON	was appointed to command that vessel which went from the flag-ship .

		Sometime in May he sailed for
Machias	LOCATION	, about 80 leagues from hence eastward , to recover some guns which were lost in a wrecked schooner : at the same time he had two sloops under his convoy to load with wood for the use of the fleet and the garrison .

		In performing this business he was severely attacked by the Provincial troops from the shore , which he beat off with some loss on both sides ; however they armed two sloops and when the tender attempted to go off they pursued her , and began a second engagement with more vigour than before ; in this conflict Mr.
Moore	PERSON	was wounded in three places , and was carried off the deck , desiring the people to maintain the fight gallantly to the last : but the want of his presence to animate them , greatly altered the circumstance , and the survivors submitted to the foe .

		The brave young man was killed with three of his men and three wounded tho ' he laid till the succeeding day before he expired .

		While he lived his activity , sobriety , sensibility , honour and courage , made him respected and admired ; he died on the point of preferment , a loss to his country and the naval service ; and he is now universally lamented by the Admiral and the fleet , and by his shipmates in particular ; for few young men had such merit to boast of , and fewer leave this world with so exemplary a character .

		SCHEME FOR IMPORTING GOODS FROM CAPE
FRANCOIS	PERSON	TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE CONVENTION -LSB- OF
MARYLAND	LOCATION	-RSB- 1 As it will be absolutely necessary to have frequent Intelligence from
Europe	LOCATION	and to Import manufactures from thence , should the present unhappy contest continue longer between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	; The following Scheme is submitted to consideration .

		ー That an Agent or Factor for the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	should be established at
Cape Francois	LOCATION	in
Hispaniola	LOCATION	; ー In order to supply
North America	LOCATION	with dry Goods , Powder & a He should Import them there in French bottoms from
Nantes	ORGANIZATION	,
Havre de Grace	LOCATION	and
Dunkirk	LOCATION	; ー That a Number of small Vessels known for prime Sailors carrying about four or five hundred Barrels of flour should be employed to ply from
North America	LOCATION	to the aforesaid Cape with flour chiefly Superfine ,
Rice	PERSON	and other valuable commodities to be there delivered to the said Agent , who in return would send by them to
North America the Goods	ORGANIZATION	he should have imported from
Europe	LOCATION	& any commodities of the growth of Hispaniola that should be from time to time required .

		ー From the said Cape the Agent may have a trade in french bottoms with the Neutral ports in the
West Indies	LOCATION	by which means a market for flour and other American commodities may be extended to larger quantities then necessary for Hispaniola and proper remittances particularly in Rum & Spirit from those Neutral ports made at the
Cape	LOCATION	, from whence it should be sent to
North America	LOCATION	.

		ー This Extensive trade would anable the Agent to make more remittances for payment of the Goods Imported from
France	LOCATION	ー The defficiency may be made up by Venturing in proper times Vessels from
North America	LOCATION	with Tobacco wheat and flour to
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	ー
Portugal	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, as the proceeds of their Cargoes -LRB- over what should be necessary to procure them a loading of Salt and other goods thought proper to Venture to Import from thence on their return to
North America	LOCATION	, -RRB- may be remitted to the Agent 's Correspondants in
France	LOCATION	.

		ー Should it be thought proper to employ North American Vessels from the
Cape	LOCATION	to
France	LOCATION	, or to the Neutral ports , the same may be done with Safety by useing proper means to Effectuate it .

		ー There are Weekly and almost daily arrivals and departures from & to
France	LOCATION	at the
Cape	LOCATION	, by which the Agent may receive & forward Intelligences to and from
Europe	LOCATION	and
North America	LOCATION	ー
Cape Francois	LOCATION	is the Port in the
West Indies	LOCATION	the nearest and best Situated for a short Navigation from and to
North America	LOCATION	.

		ー Should the small Vessels Employed to ply from
North America	LOCATION	to and from the
Cape	LOCATION	, be required to be armed so as to give them a chance to defend themselves from Tenders , It may be done at the
Cape	LOCATION	cheaper then in
North America	LOCATION	.

		ー This mode of Conveyance by the Way of the
Cape	LOCATION	is preferable to that Immediately from
Europe	LOCATION	, because it would be inconvenient for Small Vessels to go so long a Voyage , which it is well known they can with convenience and some degree of safety do to and from the
Cape	LOCATION	; beside by this means they would be less liable to a discovery by the Court of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		ー There could be no risks on the goods Imported from
France	LOCATION	to the
Cape	LOCATION	, as a small premium of Insurances would cover all , and from the
Cape	LOCATION	to
North America	LOCATION	, should few of the Small Vessels employed be lost it would on the whole be inconsiderable .

		ー Should a reconciliation take place between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, the goods Imported by the Agent from
France	LOCATION	or the Neutral Ports to the
Cape	LOCATION	would always be safe there , and in case they should not then be admitted in
North America	LOCATION	, the Agent may procure a market for them to some advantage & remit the proceeds thereof to
France	LOCATION	, from whence the ballance due to the Concerned may always be had .

		ー A Person of Confidence may be established either at
Nantes	LOCATION	or Havre de Grace as an Agent or Factor for sake of conveying safer Intelligences , with which the Agent at the Cape Should chiefly correspond with and get the goods exported chiefly by him from
France	LOCATION	to the
Cape	LOCATION	, By their means Intelligence may be procured from and sent to the
Friends of America	ORGANIZATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	, as soon if not sooner than any other way that may be thought of .

		ー Should the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	declaine carrying this Scheme into execution , May it not be done by the Convention of a Province or Provinces ?

		or by a Number of Merchants Interested each for his respective Share or Shares , of the Sums they should think proper to Venture in it , and thereby from such sufficient Capital Sum to Effectuate it to their adventages & the genera1 good of the
United Colonies?ー	ORGANIZATION	1 .

		1775 .

		Sir , I have informed your Excellency of the fitting out a Vessel from
Machias	LOCATION	to cruise for the Vessels employed in carrying Cattle , Hay & other supplies for his Majesty 's Fleets and
Army	ORGANIZATION	by Depositions taken before his
Majesty 's Council	ORGANIZATION	, it appears they have Designs upon this Province , that the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	have empowered Persons residing there to act against his Majesty , That they have been making inquiry about the Strength of the
Fort of Annapolis	LOCATION	, & at
St Johns River	LOCATION	, & I beg leave to inform you that the Inhabitants of both places & their Environs are such as have removed from
New England	LOCATION	, & that little or no Dependence can be had on the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	there ; that these Fortresses are without any Cannon for Defence & without Troops & much is to -LSB- be -RSB- fear 'd if they shou 'd Attempt anv Descent there that no Troops can be spard from hence as your Excellency will see by the Return being now obliged to order thirty of the Militia on Guard every night for the protection of the Magazines here , & to patrole to the
Navy Yard	ORGANIZATION	.

		I also hear that a large Vessel of 130 Tons is fitting out at
Pemiquid	LOCATION	for the same purpose , & it is to be feared that the Navigation from the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	will be interrupted .

		I am therefore of Opinion that it will become extreme Necessary to Station at least a Sloop of War with one or two Armed Schooners for the Protection of the Provision Vessels , and coast of that part of the Province , to cruise between Grand Passage & Passamaquoddy , by which means their intentions may be Defeated , and their Vessels taken .

		The Magistrates at
Annapolis	LOCATION	have applied for some Cannon to mount on the Fort & Ammunition for the Inhabitants which I have Consented to send them by the first safe Conveyance , and as Captain -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Mowatt	PERSON	was Bound to
Boston	LOCATION	I applied both to him & Captain
-LSB- Edward -RSB- Meadows	PERSON	, but was informed by them that on Account of Captain Mowatts particular Orders from the Admiral my request could not be complied with .

		It would be I apprehend for his Majesty 's
Service	ORGANIZATION	when Necessity requires it that Conditional Orders were given , that in such Cases the Armed Vessels might Assist in case of unforseen Accidents , & which may happen & require a sudden remedy before it be possible to send advice to you The Militia here will chearfully Continue to do duty were the private men allow 'd for their Duty , I apprehend that 12d per man for Privates & non Commission Officers for the Day on which they do duty only would be a sufficient inducement for their Continuance in Duty till they can be otherwise relieved for otherwise they can not be obliged by the Laws here to perform in that Service .

		I have received your Excellency 's favour of the 14th Instant & shall take care that the new Recruits be carefully Trained , and as soon as they are fitted to do duty take care they mount with the other Troops .

		I am sorry to find some of his Majesty 's old Servants joined with the Rebels , which I could never have conceived to have happened .

		I am with great Respect -LSB- & c. -RSB-

NATHAN	PERSON	IRISH TO THE
PENNSYLVANIA	LOCATION	COMMITTEE OF SAFETY 1 Gentlemen , As the Defence of this City and suburbs from an attack by Water is at present the Concern of its Inhabitants , I beg you will excuse one of them for offering with the greatest Deference to your better Judgment , a Model for a Boat or Gundalo .

		This Model is nearly proportioned to a boat of 45 feet
Keil	PERSON	, 11 feet Beam & 3 feet 6 inches deep in the Clear from Ceiling to the top of her Gunnels , and towards her stern to have erected a Parapet or Breastwork to be made
Cannon	ORGANIZATION	proof , -LRB- if it should not prove too heavy -RRB- with a porthole in it for an 18 or 24 pounder , and on the Top of the Breastwork to have 2 Wall pieces fixt and 2 Swivels on the Bow for keeping off Boats , & c , and to have as many oars as may be found convenient , & to row either end foremost as may be required .

		A Boat of this kind I presume whould be kept as near right ahead or right astern of an Enemy as possible , and to keep her stern to the Enemy .

		If there should be any Batterys on the Banks of the
River	LOCATION	when the Enemy is nearly opposite to such Battery would be a Convenient time for these boats to attack them because a Ship could not bring her Broadside to bear on the Boats without being in danger of being Raked fore and aft from the Battery .

		I do not mean to reflect on the Construction of the Boats already built , nor the manner in which 't is proposed to fight them , But if they are to fight only from behind
Islands	LOCATION	as I have heard some people say , I fear the Enemy will get abreast of them before they can get many Shot at her , and they will be too much exposed to the
Enemy	ORGANIZATION	's Broadside , which may prove fatal to the men and boat .

		A Boat thus fortified -LRB- if it should be found practicable -RRB- may not only keep in the Channel as long as she can fight , but may venture nearer an Enemy than those where the Men are so much exposed .

		The Breastworks in the Model is proportioned to about 4 feet thick , 19 feet long , and 4 feet above the Gunnels .

		The long premeditated , and now , avowed design of the British government , to raise a revenue from the property of the colonists without their consent , on the gift , grant , and disposition of the commons of
Great Britain	LOCATION	; the arbitrary , and vindictive statutes passed under colour of punishing a riot , to subdue by military force , and by famine , the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	; the unlimited power assumed by parliament to alter the charter of that province , and the constitution of all the colonies , thereby destroying the essential securities of the lives , liberties , and properties of the colonists ; the commencement of hostilities by the ministerial forces , and the cruel prosecution of the war against the people of the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	, followed by General
-LSB- Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	's proclamation , declaring almost the whole of the inhabitants of the
united colonies	ORGANIZATION	, by name or description , rebels and traitors , are sufficient causes to arm a free people in defence of their liberty , and to justify resistance , no longer dictated by prudence merely , but by necessity , and leave no alternative but base submission or manly opposition to uncontroulable tyranny .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	chose the latter , and for the express purpose of securing and defending the
united colonies	ORGANIZATION	, and preserving them in safety , against all attempts to carry the abovementioned acts into execution by force of arms , Resolved , that the said colonies be immediately put into a state of defence , and now supports , at the joint expence , an army to restrain the further violence , and repel the future attacks of a disappointed and exasperated enemy , We therefore , inhabitants of the province of
Maryland	LOCATION	, firmly persuaded that it is necessary and justifiable to repel force by force , do approve of the opposition by arms to the British troops , employed to enforce obedience to the late acts and statutes of the British parliament , for raising a revenue in
America	LOCATION	, and altering and changing the charter and constitution of the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	, and for destroying the essential securities for the lives , liberties , and properties of the subjects in the united colonies .

		And We do unite and associate , as one band , and firmly and solemnly engage and pledge ourselves to each other , and to
America	LOCATION	, that we will , to the utmost of our power , promote and support the present opposition , carrying on , as well by arms , as by the continental association restraining our commerce .

		And as in these times of public danger , and until a reconciliation with Great-Britain on constitutional principles is effected -LRB- an event , we most ardently wish may soon take place -RRB- the energy of government , may be greatly impaired , so that even zeal unrestrained , may be productive of anarchy and confusion ; WE do in like manner unite , associate , and solemnly engage , in maintenance of good order , and the public peace , to support the civil power in the due execution of the laws , so far as may be consistent with the present plan of opposition ; and to defend with our utmost power all persons from every species of outrage to themselves or their property , and to prevent any punishment , from being inflicted on any offenders , other than such , as shall be adjudged by the civil magistrate , the continental congress , our convention , council of safety , or committees of observation .

Long Island	LOCATION	, in order to remove from thence some Stock and Hay .

		On his Way he was fired upon by the Men of War lying near said
Island	LOCATION	, but notwithstanding the very heavy fire from the Ships , he proceeded ; when not finding any Stock on the Island , he fired the Barns , in which was a Quantity of Hay , he not being able to remove it ; as he perceiv 'd several Barges , Cutters , and an arm 'd Schooner coming upon him , having executed his Designs , so far as to deprive our Enemy of the Advantage they might receive from the Hay , & c. which he destroyed , he retreated ; and when on board , he found himself again beset by the
Savage Enemy	PERSON	, who perhaps would have taken some of the hindermost Boats , had it not been for the good Conduct of the Commander , and a
Party	ORGANIZATION	from
Squantum	LOCATION	, posted on the shore , who by a warm fire drove off the Enemy ; they killed one of our Men on the shore , and it is asserted by one in a Boat that there were two of the Enemy killed .

		GEORGE WASHINGTON TO JOHN AUGUSTINE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	1 Dear Brother : Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, about 5 miles from
Boston	LOCATION	, July 27 , 1775 .

		On the 2nd Inst .

		I arrived at this place , after passing through a great deal of delightful Country , covered with grass , -LRB- although the Season has been dry -RRB- in a very different manner to what our Lands in
Virginia	LOCATION	are .

		I found a mixed multitude of People here , under very little discipline , order , or Government .

		I found the enemy in possession of a place called Bunker 's
Hill	PERSON	, on
Charles Town Neck	PERSON	, strongly Intrenched , and Fortifying themselves ; I found part of our
Anny	PERSON	on two
Hills	LOCATION	, -LRB- called Winter and
Prospect Hills	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- about a Mile and a quarter from the enemy on Bunker 's
Hill	PERSON	, in a very insecure state ; I found another part of the Army at this Village ; and a third part at
Roxbury	LOCATION	, guarding the Entrance in and out of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		My whole time , since I came here , has been Imployed in throwing up
Lines of Defence	LOCATION	at these three several places ; to secure , in the first Instance , our own Troops from any attempts of the Enemy ; and , in the next , to cut off all Communication between their troops and the Country : For to do this , and to prevent them from penetrating into the Country with Fire and Sword , and to harass them if they do , is all that is expected of me ; and if effected , must totally overthrow the designs of Administration , as the whole Force of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in the Town and
Harbour of Boston	LOCATION	can answer no other end , than to sink her under the disgrace and weight of the expense .

		Their Force , including
Marines	ORGANIZATION	, Tories , & c. , are computed , from the best accounts I can get , at about 12,000 Men ; ours , including Sick absent , & c. , at about 16,000 ; but then we have a Cemi Circle of Eight or Nine Miles , to guard to every part of which we are obliged to be equally attentive ; whilst they , situated as it were in the Center of the Cemicircle , can bend their whole Force -LRB- having the entire command of the Water -RRB- , against any one part of it with equal facility ; This renders our Situation not very agreeable , though necessary ; however , by incessant labour -LRB- Sundays not excepted -RRB- , we are in a much better posture of defence than when I first came .

		The Inclosed , though rough , will give you some small Idea of the Situation of
Boston	LOCATION	, and
Bay	LOCATION	on this side ; as also of the Post they have Taken in
Charles Town Neck	LOCATION	, Bunker 's
Hill	PERSON	, and our Posts .

		By very authentick Intelligence lately received out of
Boston	LOCATION	-LRB- from a Person who saw the returns -RRB- , the number of Regulars -LRB- including I presume the Marines -RRB- the morning of the Action on Bunker 's
Hill	PERSON	amounted to 7533 Men ; their killed and wounded on that occasion amounted to 1043 , whereof 92 were Officers .

		Our loss was 138 killed , 36 Missing , and 276 Wounded .

		The Enemy are sickly , and scare of Fresh provisions , Beef , which is chiefly got by slaughtering their Milch Cows in
Boston	LOCATION	, sells from one shilling to 18d Sterling per lb. ; and that it may not get cheaper , or more plenty , I have drove all the Stock within a considerable distance of this place , back into the Country , out of the Way of the Men of war 's Boats ; In short , I have , and shall continue to do , every thing in my power to distress them .

		The Transports are all arrived and their whole Reinforcement is Landed , so that I can see no reason why they should not if they ever attempt it , come boldly out and put the matter to Issue at once if they think themselves not strong enough to do this .

		they surely will carry their Arms -LRB- having Ships of War and Transports ready -RRB- to some other part of the Continent , or relinquish the dispute ; the last of which the Ministry , unless compelled will never agree to do .

		Our Works , and those of the Enemy are so near and quite open between that we see every thing that each other is doing .

		recollect nothing more worth mentioning .

		I shall therefore conclude with my best wishes , and love to my Sister and Family , and Compliments to any enquiring Friends , your most affectionate brother .

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	, PRESIDENT OF THE
CONTINENTAL CONGRESS	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, July 27 , 1775 Nothing material has occurred in either camp since I had the honour of addressing you on the twenty-first instant by express .

		But on Tuesday -LSB- July 25 -RSB- three men of war and nine transports sailed out of
Boston Harbour	LOCATION	, and stood a course about east-south east .

		One Groves , who came out of
Boston	LOCATION	the same evening , informed the officer at one of the outposts , that the Transports had on board six hundred Men , and were bound to
Block Island	LOCATION	,
Fisher	PERSON	's Island and
Long Island	LOCATION	, to plunder them and bring off what cattle they may find .

		The fellow returned again into
Boston	LOCATION	, under such suspicious circumstances , that it has led me to doubt the truth of his intelligence .

		A deserter , who came in afterwards , informs me that it was given out in their camp that they were either gone for Indians or fresh provisions , and that each Transport had but twenty Men on board .

		Upon this intelligence I immediately wrote to Governor
-LSB- Nicholas -RSB- Cooke	PERSON	, of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and to General -LSB-
David -RSB- Wooster	PERSON	, that they might use proper precautions for removing the cattle off those islands and the coasts and to prevent any surprise .

		As we are confirmed by every account in the scarcity of fresh provisions in the enemy 's camp , and particularly by this deserter , who says they have had none since the Battle of
Lexington	LOCATION	, it is very probable this voyage may be only intended for a supply ; but it may possibly be otherwise .

		I thought it best to transmit the intelligence to the honourable
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that they may forward it to the Southward , or take such other steps as they may judge proper .

		Since writing the above three men -LRB- deserters -RRB- have come out , which make four in twenty-four hours .

		Their accounts correspond with those of the first who came out , and which I have related above .

		1775 Since my last of yesterday , Capt. -LSB-
Jeremiah -RSB- Halsey	PERSON	, who has commanded the
Sloop	ORGANIZATION	2 since she was left by her former Commander , arrived at this
Post	ORGANIZATION	.

		He reports that the Schooner Liberty is returned from her Cruize towards the
North End of Lake Camplain	LOCATION	ー that about
Isle la Mott	PERSON	she fell in with two Canoes , containing three Frenchmen and as many Indians ー that the -LSB- y -RSB- informed the Capt : that Gov -LSB- Guy -RSB-
Carlton	PERSON	had in vain attempted to prevail upon the Savages to act agt us ー that the Canadians would be neuter , perhaps act in our Favour , that a pickett Fort , surrounded with a Ditch , is erected at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	ー that Preparations were making for mounting Cannon ー that the regular Troops at that Place consisted of about four Hundred & fifty Men ー that two Men from Crown Point , who were carrying an Indian Boy on his Return from Mr
-LSB- Eleazer	PERSON	-RSB-
Wheelock	PERSON	's School into
Canada	LOCATION	, had been made Prisoners & detained , and that a scouting Party of regular Troops had been almost as far South as Mr
Gillelands	PERSON	-LRB- about 35 Miles from hence -RRB- .

		Capt -LSB- Remember -RSB-
Baker	PERSON	who left
Crown Point	LOCATION	with the
Party	ORGANIZATION	to carry the Indian Boy , but separated from him , fell in with some Indians at
Missique	LOCATION	.

		Their Information confirms the above .

		His is enclosed .

		In this Situation of Affairs , no Manoeuvre appears to me more necessary than an immediate Movement to
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	, which will determine what we are to expect from the Canadians ; and thus known , any future military operations in their Quarter may be regulated by it .

		But how to get there ー all the Craft I am possessed of -LRB- and I have already bought or engaged all the Pittiaugers belonging to the Inhabitants here -RRB- will not carry at the utmost more than five Hundred 81 fifty Men , nor are any of the stores mentioned in a former Letter of mine as yet arrived here .

		It is probable from the Letter which I yesterday transmitted to you , that they have not yet left New-York ; and without them I can not proceed , even if I had Boats ; for as my whole Stock of Powder will be less than 3 Tons , when that from
Philada	PERSON	arrives , I must necessarily not fire a gun without certain Execution , and therefore want the entrenching Tools , which are Part of the Articles , to make the Approaches up to their very Ditch ; and that can not be done with the few Tools I have here .

		Altho you will perceive by the enclosed Return that my Stock of Provisions is very scant , yet I shall not be detained on that Acct as it may follow me .

		I shall make all the Dispatch I possibly can , and move the Moment I am in a Condition for it .

		It appears to me highly necessary that more Powder shd be sent up ; for even If I should be fortunate enough to succeed against
St Johns	PERSON	with the little I have , it can not be expected that much would be left .

		But if I should be under the disagreeable Necessity of retreating , the Want of it might be followed with the Loss of this Fortress and Command of the

		As times are become more critical than ever ; and by Information both to you and myself , the Rebels have a Number of boats , with which they can mean us no good , I am to beg of you to make such a desposition of the Transports as may put them beyond danger from the Enemy and under the protection of his Majesty 's Ships , I am likewise to beg you to consider the situation of the Symmetry and to take such measures as to make her servicable , and as soon as you are enabled to place some Ship of War in her Station that may do the duty effectually ; when she may be removed , I am with great Regard , Sir , & ca 1 .

		Gage Papers , CL .

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	1 Sir ,
Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	July 28 1775 .

		By Letters lately from
Halifax	LOCATION	I find a terrible Fire had like to have happened in his Majesty 's Yard at that place .

		It broke out in the
Paint Cabin	LOCATION	in the Boat house about 1/2 past 10 in the Night of the 8th instant .

		By timely assistance it was extinguished in less than half an hour ; though not without alarming the Town .

		This is the second time within a twelve month .

		The very next Morning after the Action at
Lexington	LOCATION	on the 19 of April I dispatched Orders to Captain
-LSB- Edward -RSB- Medows	PERSON	of his Majesty 's Ship Tartar -LRB- whom I had intended for the Gulph and
River St Lawrence	LOCATION	-RRB- to stay at
Halifax	LOCATION	for the protection of the
Kings Yard	ORGANIZATION	and Stores That Ship has accordingly remained there , and every Intelligence from thence proves the necessity , not only for a well manned Ship , but a much greater Force for Security of that Magazine .

		I am informed that the
Ordnance Store House	ORGANIZATION	wherein there is upwards of four thousand Stands of Arms , is situated entirely out of the reach of assistance from the Ships ; and as a great many People from this Province -LRB- notoriously disaffected -RRB- have removed themselves to
Halifax	LOCATION	and other parts of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, there is reason to fear the worst actions from such an Influx of Rebels , where they can do much Mischief .

		However I hope the Vigilance of Captain
Medows	PERSON	and the Officers of the Tartar , and those of the Yard , will baffle every secret attempt to destroy or injure it .

		I expect the
Canceaux Armed Ship	ORGANIZATION	and
Halifax Schooner	ORGANIZATION	from thence every day , and I have also directed Lieutenant -LSB-
John -RSB- Knight	PERSON	in the Diligent Schooner to leave the business of sounding for the present and come to
Boston	LOCATION	, having more pressing Service for him than what he is now employed on .

		In this Harbour there is only the
Somerset	LOCATION	,
Boyne	LOCATION	,
Preston	PERSON	, and Lively .

		In consequence of an application from General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	-LRB- a Copy of which is inclosed -RRB- I shall place either the Falcon or
Merlin	LOCATION	, when they arrive , in the Symmetry 's Station ; though if I had one it ought to be a stout Frigate .

		Never were Ships more wanted than at present for various Services ; In particular to seize every thing intended for the support of the Rebels or that may arrive and fall into their hands , and to remain and form a proper force in different parts of the
Harbour	LOCATION	.

		The great number of Whale Boats collected here requires all possible Vigilance on our parts to prevent a Surprize , and necessarily occasions a great deal of Boat duty .

		The want of fresh Provisions and the hot Weather begin to be felt in the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, and Fluxes incapacitate numbers from doing their Duty , but as yet this Disorber is not fatal .

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 28 -LSB- July 1775 -RSB- By the Brig
John	PERSON	bound to
Virginia	LOCATION	, the Admiral wrote to the Earl of
Dunmore	PERSON	, Governor of that Colony to assure his Lordship that it would give him great satisfaction to be able to send him such a naval force as would effectually command the navigation not only of the great rivers but of the whole coast , but at present the
King 's Squadron	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	was barely sufficient for the Northern Provinces and really would not admit of being lessened except on the most urgent occasions ; that if government should think fit to enforce the laws , and compel the Americans to do what was right for themselves , his Majesty 's fleet in these Seas must be considerably augmented , and he should then avail himself of his Lordship 's hint respecting the great rivers , which empty themselves into the
Bay of Chesepeak	LOCATION	, by sending there what force could be spared , and that he should be happy at all times to receive any information from his Lordship for the good of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's service , and was extremely concerned the weak state of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	would not at present admit of his sending any more Ships to the Southward .

		The Admiral informed his Lordship that Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Macartney	PERSON	was sent to relieve Capt ; -LSB-
George -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	, heartily to cooperate in every measure for the Kings service and give every assistance in his power ; and that , altho ' there was little reason for such an expectation , the Admiral sincerely hoped the people under his Excellency 's government might yet accept the terms his Majesty most graciously held out to them , before it was too late , return to their duty and thereby avert the miseries impending if they persisted in their present senseless and rebellious proceedings .

		The Admiral added that he presumed his Lordship was no stranger to the transactions of the rebels in this and the neighbouring provinces ; that on our parts we were anxiously expecting arrivals , and the ultimate determination of
Great Britain	LOCATION	with respect to her colonies , now avowedly in arms and contending for absolute independence and empire .

North Carolina	LOCATION	to shew their Lordships how pressing they are for an additional number of ships and small Vessels to be stationed within their Governments .

		I inclose the Copy of a Letter from Sir
James Wright	PERSON	Governor of
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		It gives me much satisfaction that as his Majesty 's Service would not admit of my sending a Sloop to
Savannah	LOCATION	according to their Lordships Orders , the Kings Affairs in the Colony of
Georgia	LOCATION	have not suffered thereby .

		2 I shall be inexpressibly happy to have the Honor of their Lordship 's particular Commands respecting the Rebellion on this Continent , and shall exert my utmost Endeavours to carry them into Execution in the best manner for his
Majesty 's Service	ORGANIZATION	, and to their Lordship 's satisfaction .

		In regard to the Application of his Majesty 's Governors along the Continent , for Ships and Vessels of War , their Lordships I trust are fully apprized that it is entirely out of my power to comply with any part of their Requests , until Reinforcements arrive from
England	LOCATION	, and I am instructed concerning the measures
Great Britain	LOCATION	intends to pursue in consequence of the Revolt of her Colonies on this Continent .

Edward -RSB- Thornbrough	PERSON	and -LSB-
Francis -RSB- Parry	PERSON	repeat their Representations , the former of the very bad condition the Tamer is in ; and the latter that the Cruizer is in want of all kinds of Stores .

Cattle Sheep &	ORGANIZATION	c from the several

Boston	LOCATION	where they already suffer greatly for Want of fresh Provisions .

		As it is of great Consequence to prevent their being supplied I recommend to you to procure the Town to be called together immediately to consult upon the proper Measures for Defence .

		By Letters from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	we are assured that General -LSB- Guy -RSB-
Carleton	PERSON	's Endeavours to prevail upon the French and Indians to take up Arms against us have proved ineffectual ; as also have the Attempts made by the Tools of the Ministry to stir up the Indians upon the Frontiers of all the Colonies .

Philadelphia	LOCATION	, July 29 , 1775 We jointly lament the loss of a Quincy and a Warren , two characters as great in proportion to their age , as any I have known in
America	LOCATION	... 2 I have a great opinion of your knowledge and judgement from long experience , concerning the channels and islands in
Boston	LOCATION	harbour ; but I confess your opinion that the harbour might be blocked up , and seamen and soldiers made prisoners at discretion , was too bold and enterprising for me , who am not very apt to startle at a daring proposal ; but I believe I may safely promise you powder enough , in a little time , for any purpose whatever ... I hope , Sir , we shall never see a total stagnation of commerce for any length of time .

		Necessity will force open our ports ; trade , if I mistake not , will be more free than usual .

		Your friend , Dr.
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Franklin	PERSON	, to whom I read your letter , and who desires his kind compliments to you , has been employed in directing the construction of row-gallies for this City .

		The
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	for this Province have ordered twenty of them to be built ; 3 some of them are finished .

		I have seen one of them ; it has twelve oars on each side .

		They rowed up the river the first time , four miles in an hour against a tide which ran down four miles an hour .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	have recommended to the Colonies to make provision for the defence of their navigation , in their harbours , rivers , and on their sea coasts .

		J. P ー KE TO CAPTAIN
JAMES WALLACE	PERSON	,
H.M.S. ROSE	LOCATION	,
NEWPORT	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir , Though I have not the misfortune of personally knowing you , yet I am perfectly acquainted wit , h your character , which is obnoxious to common fame .

		Were you actuated in your present proceedings from principles misinformed , it would be the duty of every discerning man to point out your error , and rectify your mistake ー but when frequent remonstrances are of no effect and repeated acts of violence mark with infamy your conduct , I am induced to think you are actuated by no principle but the love of rapine .

		Your late insolent reply to Governor
-LSB- Nicholas -RSB- Cooke	PERSON	's letter proves at once your ignorance , pride and contempt of all laws ; and convinces every man , that you are a person capable of the worst of purposes , and ready for any dirty service , that your despotic masters , the British ministry , are pleased to impose on you .

		At the same time , while you are bestowing the epithets of rebel and traitor upon the good people of these colonies , you are acting the hardy pirate under royal colours .

		Can any thing be more inconsistent for a monarch , who reigns only for the happiness of his people , to send out his hireling servants to rob and pillage the substance of the most deserving of his subjects ; whose only crime -LRB- if I may use the term -RRB- is an enthusiastic regard to the common rights of mankind in general , and the original British constitution in particular !

		But I fear I condescend too much , to reason with you , Sir , who have no ideas of your own , and at best are but a living machine in the hand of power , notwithstanding your many acts of villany ー In some small degree , I think you are pardonable , when we consider that your understanding naturally confined , is blinded by avarice and a love of self , which destroys every other consideration , and render you incapable of judging between right and wrong .

		The rule of your conduct is implicitly to obey the commands of your masters , be they ever so arbitrary and unjust .

		Follow , therefore , the bent of your own inclinations , and enrich yourself by the plunder of those , to whose independent souls you must appear an object truly contemptible .

		Your reign will soon have a period , an infamous period ; your floating prisons will no longer be an asylum to screen you from the vengeance of an injured , insulted people , whose armies now encircle your miserable handful of hireling troops within the town of
Boston	LOCATION	, and will in process of time cleanse our seas of those pilfering nests of royal pirates , that now infest our shores and disturb our tranquillity .

		Remember the fate of the Gaspee schooner , and tremble for your safety ; for those same people who devoted her to destruction , at the hazard of their lives , will again , when urged by repeated oppressions and aggravated insults , drag you like a felon from your armed den , devoted to the most exemplary punishment , though not adequate to your crimes .

		I would remonstrate with you like a friend on the infamy of your proceedings and endeavour to reclaim you to honesty -LRB- if you ever was possessed of it -RRB- by government .

		ー But I believe you to be a wretch incapable of reason , in whose callous breast one sentiment of honour or humanity never entered .

		I would willingly entertain a better opinion of those two gentlemen who are employed in the same infamous service .

		Captain
-LSB- James -RSB- Ayscough	PERSON	appears to be a man of moderation , from which I would infer , that he may be a person endowed with some good qualities , if not corrupted by your bad examples .

		But as they are companions of yours , there is little room left to doubt their approbation of your conduct .

		Candour itself can not screen them from the imputation of your guilt ; and , like the honest countryman , they may be hanged for associating with thieves .

		It would be a folly next to infatuation to attempt to argue the point , upon the English constitution , or the natural rights derived from that constitution , & c. guarantied to us by charters indefeasible , or to prostitute the divine powers of the soul to the investigation of your niggard understanding .

		Besides , I would not even now condescend to notice you , if it was not for the same reason that we punish an assassin to prevent his future indeterminate attacks .

		Not to detain you , Sir , I would recommend a speedy reformation to you , to restore the effects you have stolen from the inhabitants of
Newport	LOCATION	and
Providence	LOCATION	, and to reimburse the Colonies for all the robberies and depredations you have feloniously committed upon them , together with your smock faced colleague , who I hear has heartily coincided with your measures ; I say , I would recommend those steps to you , not from a conviction of justice , for I believe your conscience is already seared against reflecxion ー but , from the same motive that actuates a common thief , I mean : he fear of punishment , which will undoubtedly overtake you in the end , though perhaps not so soon , as every honest American wishes , or your deserts require .

Marines	ORGANIZATION	were drawn up , tho ' not without great Confusion , perceiving many of them in liquor and totally unfit for Service ; Notwithstanding I will venture to affirm every precaution was used to prevent it by frequently examining them and cautioning the Carpenters against bringing Liquor on pain of their being sent Prisoners to
Boston	LOCATION	, tho ' I am of opinion it could be conveyed to them by no other means .

		Several of the
Marines	ORGANIZATION	were perceived to be in Liquor in the Night and two Centinels relieved and confined for that fault .

		The Marines without Orders fired a number of Musquets at the Boats , then laying on their Oars ;
Lieutt Colthurst	PERSON	then advised with me what was most proper to be done observing there was a much greater force than was possible for us to defeat , I replied as the Whale Boats were laying on their Oars and appearing to consult how they should act ; by continuing the fire they might probably retreat , which Words I had scarcely uttered when the Rebels cheered divided and proceeded to land on different parts of the Island .


Lieutt Colthurst	PERSON	was then of opinion that by retreating to the
House	ORGANIZATION	we might defend ourselves till assistance came from the Ships but recalled his Proposals giving for reason that as the
House	ORGANIZATION	was defended within only the Rebels would set it on fire which if I may presume to give -LSB- my opinion -RSB- was highly probable , as the Rebels after getting within a few Yards of it would have received no hurt from our fire it being impossible to bring any Musquets to bear on them , and there being many Openings in the lower part of the
House	ORGANIZATION	which they might with great Ease have set fire to .

		He therefore judged it expedient for us all to retreat on board a Schooner than laying in the Mole afloat ; which finding him resolved on doing and many of the Rebels being landed -LSB- , -RSB- with his Approbation I told him I would repair to the long Boat which lay at a small distance from the Mole and use my Endeavours to cover the
Marines	ORGANIZATION	in the Embarking ; which he consented to I proceeded to the Wharf jumped overboard and waded to a Canoe by which means gained the long Boat , got under weigh and used my Endeavours to cover their Retreat .

		The Schooner in easting grounded which being observed by the Rebels , who having set the Houses on fire , immediately boarded and took them all Prisoners .

		As I could be of no further Assistance I judged it necessary for the safety of the Men and Boat , the Whale Boats then pursuing me , to retreat towards the Lively , which I could not effect without difficulty being obliged to turn against Tide .

		I can not pretend to say what Number of Men were Killed or wounded , nor did I see any fall except Mr.
Coulthurst	PERSON	on the Wharf getting his men on board the Schooner .

		Neither can I pretend to say what part of the Pilot and Carpenters took as Mr
Coulthurst	PERSON	gave Orders to the Centinel at the House that if we should be attacked not to suffer any of them to come out , nor did I see any of them out except one who escaped with me in the Long boat .

		Centinels to the Number of seven were placed every Night and all the rest of the Men accouter 'd in the Guard Room .

		My Lord , In my letter No 41 of the 27 June last , I acquainted your Lordship , That the people at

Caule	LOCATION	and Hay for the Troops at

		2 by a person belonging to this Province , who has been since there , I am informd , That the provincial congress of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	have empowerd the
People of Mechias	ORGANIZATION	, and others in the
Neighbourd	LOCATION	, whose Numbers are about seven or eight hundred to Act against His Majestys Troops , and a Vessel in Consequence thereof has Saild , he further informs me they were making inquiry about the Strength of the Forts at
Annapolis	LOCATION	and
St Johns River	LOCATION	, from whence I conjecturd they were meditating a design against this Province ; I must beg leave to lay before your Lordship , the State of that part of the Province , to whom the Mechias people are near borderers , Our Inhabitants of Passamaquody and
St Johns River	LOCATION	, are wholly from
New England	LOCATION	, as are the greatest part of the Inhabitants of
Annapolis River	LOCATION	, and those of the Townships of
Cornwallis	PERSON	,
Horton	PERSON	,
Falmouth	LOCATION	, and
Newport	LOCATION	, some of which are not Forty Miles from this Town .

		That by reason of their connections with the people of
New England	LOCATION	little or no dependance can be plac 'd on the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	there , to make any Resistance against them , That many in this Town are disaffected , and whom likewise I can have no great dependance That should such an Attempt be made I shoud dread the Consequence , to convince your Lordship how alarming our Situation , is it was no sooner known that a Quantity of Hay was purchas 'd , for the Horse in
Boston	LOCATION	than a Stack of eight or Ten Tons which happend to be in an open Field , was maliciously set on Fire and destroy 'd , That , since that , the Buildings in the
Navy Yard	ORGANIZATION	have been set on Fire , but timely discoverd and extinguish 'd ; and from the place it happen 'd at , where no fire is ever carried , and near the magazine of Powder , it is certain , without all doubt a malicious design to destroy that Yard , the Perpetrators have not yet been discover 'd .

		The Exigencies at present have requird almost all the Kings Troops from hence , there remains here only thirty six Effective Men , as p the Return inclos 'd ; I have order 'd these to do duty near the magazine for its protection , and at the

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO THE
MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	GENERAL COURT 1 Sir : Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, July 31 , 1775 .

		I have considered the Application made me yesterday from the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	, with all the attention due to the Situation of the People , in whose behalf it is made , and the Respect due to such a Recommendation .

		Upon referring to my Instructions and Consulting with those Members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	who are Present , as well as the
General Officers	ORGANIZATION	, they all agree that it would not be consistent with my Duty to detach any Part of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	now here on any
Particular Provincial Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has been debated in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and Settled , that the Militia , or other Internal Strength of each Province , is to be applied for Defence against those Small and Particular Depredations which were to be expected , and to which they were Supposed to be competent .

		This will appear the more Proper , when it is considered that every Town and , indeed , every Part of our
Sea Coast	LOCATION	, which is exposed to these Depredations , would have an equal claim upon this Army ; It is the Misfortune of our Situation which exposes us to these Ravages , against which , in my Judgement , no such Temporary Relief would possibly secure us .

		The great advantage the Enemy has , of Transporting Troops , by being Master of the Sea , will enable them to harrass us by Diversions of this kinds ; and should we be tempted to pursue them upon every Alarm ; The
Army	ORGANIZATION	must either be so weaken 'd as to expose it to Destruction , or a great part of the Coast be still left unprotected .

		Nor , indeed , does it appear to me , that such a pursuit would be attended with the least Effect ; The first Notice of such an Incursion would be its actual Execution ; and long before any Troops could reach the Scene of Action , the Enemy would have an Opportunity to accomplish their purpose and retire .

		It would give me great pleasure to have it in my power , to extend Protection and Safety to every Individual ; but the wisdom of the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	will anticipate me in the necessity of conducting our Operations on a General and impartial Scale , so as to exclude any first cause of Complaint and Jealousy .

		I beg , Sir , you will do me the Honor to Communicate these Sentiments to the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	, and to apologize for my involuntary Delay .

		As we were alrm 'd this Morning by the Enemy , and my
Time	ORGANIZATION	taken up with giving the necessary Directions .

		I shall be happy in every Opportunity of shewing my very great Respect and Regard for the
General Court of Massachusetts Bay	ORGANIZATION	, and am , Sir , 1 .

JAMES WARREN	PERSON	TO
JOHN ADAMS	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
Watertown	LOCATION	, July 31 1775 The hint you give of inviting all nations to trade with us is indeed a grand idea , and I can easily conceive how bitterly you regret the loss of it .

		Such a step would have been worthy of such a body .

		It would have been in the true stile of a Sully , and have produced mightly consequences .

		I can easily conceive also the narrow principles that operated against and finally destroyed them .

		The two questions you ask , to what articles the trade should extend , and what bottoms it should be carried on upon , require a nice determination .

		Perhaps it would not answer our immediate purposes so well by being confined to our own bottoms , but if it be not , and we should finally be detached from
Britain	LOCATION	, we might have some difficulty in making an alteration so advantageous to ourselves in gaining great wealth and naval power .

		I hope to hear you viva voce on this subject ... .

		The most capital action was at the light house .

		You will recollect that we burnt it some time ago .

		They had for some time been very industrious in rebuilding it , and had it in such forwardness as actually to shew a light on Saturday night -LSB- July 29 -RSB- .

		About twenty-five whale boats & d two hundred men , commanded by Major -LSB-
Benjamin -RSB- Tupper	PERSON	, set off last night , and arrived about daylight , attacked the guard and workmen , and one small tender soon carried it , after killing two or three , and wounding four or five more .

		They took all the rest , burnt and destroyed the light house , took thirty six prisoners , and all their arms .

		Among the prisoners are four
Marshfield Tories	ORGANIZATION	, and three or four others .

		The rest are marines and soldiers .

		and one Man , brought of -LSB- f -RSB- all the oil and stores which were sent , without the looss of a man till they were upon their return when they were so closely persued that they were obliged to run one whale boat ashore and leave her to them .

		I understand it is next to certain I am to be attacked by Boats ; Sir , I must mention I think the Scorpion is almost the only Vessel in his Majesty 's Service that an Enemy with only small Arms could effect any Execution ; but she is without Waist , and her Decks consequently without Cover ; The men are entirely exposed to the Enemy 's fire , and this , Sir , is not the only difficulty I have in defending her ; from the Negligence of the Builder of the Dock Yard she came from , there is neither Eye bolt or Ring bolt in the Decks to run the Guns in ; and arriving at
Boston	LOCATION	, not expecting such Service , I have not yet had time to make Netting against being boarded , and this Night shall be without it .

		However I must conclude with assuring you I am making the Ship as defensible as possible in my power .

Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	, to unlade & sell the Cargo , I immediately told him that I was an Officer of the Kings Revenue , and he must not presume to sell or deliver any of the Goods , nor unlade any more for that I should immediately place the Kings Officers on board his Vessel , and take those already unloaded into Custody ー I accordingly placed three Tidesmen Vizt
Hammond Green	ORGANIZATION	,
Owen Richards	PERSON	&
John Petitt	PERSON	, and gave them charge of the Vessel & the goods in the Store , with directions to be attentive that nothing was removed from either place , ー at 11 o

Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	had sent positive Orders for them all to disperse , and leave that Vessel and Store , which order was complied with ー under these Circumstances , I think it my duty to acquaint the Hon ` ble Board , how far I proceeded in an affair of so much importance to the

		LOOSE SHEETS IN THE NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	, July 31 , 1775 -RSB- The ... expedition of Captain -LSB- John -RSB-
Robinson	PERSON	2 was formed in consequence of intelligence given that the Rebels had between two & three hundred whale boats in a Wood on the Banks of
German Town River	LOCATION	.

		He had all the Marines of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	and the following Boats Vizt 3 from the
Somerset	LOCATION	, 3 from the
Boyne	LOCATION	, 3 from the
Preston	PERSON	and the Scorpions Pinnace .

		The whole well armed and provided with every thing necessary to set fire to the Whale Boats , rendezvoused on board the Spitfire arm 'd Sloop at 10 at Night , and from thence proceeded down the
Harbour	LOCATION	, it proved a very dark Night .

		Our Cannon at
Boston Lines and Charles Town Camp	ORGANIZATION	were fired and many Shells thrown into
Roxborough	PERSON	, in order to deceive the Rebels into an expectation a little before Day Light , and thereby to draw both their Attenion and Troops from the place where
Capain Robinson	PERSON	was to land and destroy the Whale Boats .

		The Channel of the River was intricate , but the Boats had two Pilots among them , and the firing from
Boston	LOCATION	and
Roxborough	PERSON	increased with the Darkness .

		The Pilots however , whether from being Brothers and Americans , or from ruminating on their fate should they be taken , or from any other cause , were observed to be much alarmed , and upon approaching the Shore could give no clear directions .

		Every method to inspire them with Courage was in vain tried .

		Rewards or Threatenings were alike ineffectual ; they continued in a manner petrified ; And as the expedition depended on their Skill ,
Integrity and Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, it was from necessity laid aside on account of this sudden alteration in them , none other of the crew being found sufficiently acquainted with the
River	LOCATION	, or the Country , to conduct the Armaments , or that knew exactly the Spot where the Boats were concealed .

		And although it would have required little time to burn the whole , yet it was thought unadvisable to risque so many men and boats in a River totally unknown to all , as a Discovery must have been fatal therefore just at Daybreak Captain
Robinson	PERSON	, finding nothing could be done , determined to return .

		However this determination was scarcely taken , when he was alarmed with a firing at the Lighthouse , and he instantly rowed towards it with his whole Force , being then within a mile or two ; so that it is difficult to account for the rebels success against
Lieut Coulthurst	PERSON	's party in any other manner than the Admiral hath done .

		-LSB- It -RSB- seems the Rebels had that morning attacked the
Lighthouse Guard	ORGANIZATION	and carried off the entire Party Prisoners ; the Marine Officer who was killed , and two wounded Marines , excepted ... if there had been the good conduct and Resolution exerted which might have been expected from -LSB- so -RSB- strong a Party -LSB- unfinished -RSB- .

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	, DATED AUGUST 1 , 1775 '' 1 I am amazed at the stupor and supineness of your Admiralty .

		For God 's sake what are you doing in
England	LOCATION	?

		Are the friends of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and their property to be left exposed at this rate , to the dictates of an inhuman rabble ?

		... Where is the boasted
Navy	ORGANIZATION	of our country , that only one poor sloop is stationed here ?

		Whereas , if we had but three ships of war , one of fifty and two of forty guns each , this place would not only be kept in awe , and the friends of Government secured , but a sufficient quantity of provisions might be had at all times for your fleet and army , which , we are informed , are half starved at
Boston	LOCATION	.

		As to the sloop we have here , the Nautilus , I fear she will soon go to the shades ; for our good friends are building above fifty row-boats of large dimensions , which are to have a twenty-four pounder in the stern sheets , several swivels in the sides , and plenty of musquets for the people on board , and all for the purpose of attacking the King 's ships that may arrive here .

		But if Government would order the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	to sink all these vessels to the bottom wherever they met with them , a few examples of such timely severity would keep them on shore .

		I must not forget to tell you , that they are smuggling from the French West-Indies in pilot boats , all the ammunition they can get ; but two or three cruisers off the Capes would soon put an end to that business ... We had a schooner a few days since who brought a considerable quantity of gunpowder stowed under molasses , and when she arrived , she hoisted in bravo a French jack , ensign and pendant .

		If government mean to do anything , they must do it quickly , or the contest will be the stronger .

		I am surprised you do not take and stop all the ships going in or coming out of these ports .

		Conceal my name ; or I should run a great risque of my life and property , were it discovered here that I had sent you any account of these prosceedings : Indeed , I incur some danger in writing at all ; nor should I , if I could not confide in my conveyance .

MATTHEW TILGHMAN	PERSON	, PRESIDENT OF THE
MARYLAND	LOCATION	CONVENTION , TO THE
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	CONVENTION 1 Gentlemen ,
Annapolis	LOCATION	, 1st August 1775 .

		The Resolution of your Convention , That no Flour , Wheat or other Grain or Provisions of any Kind should be exported from your Colony to any part of the World after the fifth Day of August came to Hand by your Express Yesterday afternoon .

		The Delegates from this Province have communicated to this Convention , That the Utility and propriety of stopping Exports had been fully considered by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and that they had not thought proper to stop the Exports before the 10th Day of September .

		We have received Information that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	intended to adjourn the Beginning of this Week , so that this Subject can not again be brought before them .

		This Convention on mature Consideration do not see that the Advantages to the common Cause by an immediate Stoppage of the Export of Provisions could equal the Inconveniencies and Distresses of Individuals which would certainly be occasioned thereby nor that any Distress could be brought on the common Enemy by our coming into your Resolution without the Accession of the Colonies of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, which can not be brought about sooner than the 10th of September , as the Convention of
New York	LOCATION	will probably rise about the same Time as the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Assembly of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	hath already adjourned .

		For these Reasons , We have unanimously resolved not to prohibit Exports before that Day .

		We are -LSB- & c. -RSB- By Order of the Convention .

		`` Hatter 's Report , ''
Drayton	PERSON	, American Revolution , I. COLONEL JAMES
CARGILL	ORGANIZATION	TO THE
MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	GENERAL COURT 1 To the Honourable the Great and
General Court	ORGANIZATION	, assembled at
Watertown	LOCATION	: The Memorial of the Officers of the
Eastern Regiment of Militia	ORGANIZATION	, in the County of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, in Council met at
Booth-Bay	LOCATION	, August 2 , 1775 , humbly sheweth : That in the night between the 20th and 21st of July ultimo , the Colonel of said Regiment received information by express that a Frigate , with four Transport Ships and three Sloops , were arrived at
Long Island	LOCATION	, in
Penobscot Bay	LOCATION	, and taking on board fuel and provisions for General -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	's
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		That the Colonel immediately dispatched orders to the proper officers to meet him at
St. George 's	LOCATION	, with a third part of each Company under his command ; in consequence of which the several Companies of each Regiment marched the next day .

		That on their arrival off said place of rendezvous it was found that certain persons , not under their command , had gone to
Camden	LOCATION	, the place of continent nearest to said island .

		That fearing the effects of this incident , the body marched after them with all possible expedition , but as soon as they reached
Camden	LOCATION	they had certain intelligence that , by means of said persons , the enemy had already received notice of the approach and design of the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	, and in consequence thereof had moved from the land out of the reach of their arms .

		That a council was immediately called , in which it was judged impracticable to execute the plan hitherto adopted against the foe thus alarmed , nor was any other way of defeating their intentions now in the power of the Militia , but that of cutting off their communications with the Main , preventing any ill-disposed persons from sending them supplies , and themselves from making any secure lodgment on shore ー that as Fort
Pownall	PERSON	stood contiguous to good navigation for Ships of any burden , it was untenable by any force we could throw into it ー as it was just at hand to the present station of the enemy ; unapproachable by us if once they shall get possession ; so situated as to command the settlements on the
River	LOCATION	and
Bay	LOCATION	; and , with the assistance of a few men and one or two small armed vessels , capable of distressing the inhabitants of the greatest part of the eastern country , so as to oblige them to abandon their abodes or act the Tory to the uttermost ; it was therefore judged to be the most alluring bait , and , at the same time the easiest prey the foe could find in these parts ー and as a letter from Mr.
-LSB- Edward -RSB- Winslow	PERSON	, who conducts their said fleet , to the
Committee of St. George	ORGANIZATION	's , together with a pretended certificate from some Selectmen in
Boston	LOCATION	, intimates a design of returning for more cargoes , it seemed highly probable that their factors would tarry at said fort , under the protection of the marines now on board said frigate , to prepare matters for this or any other fleet , on like errand , against their return .

		It was therefore unanimously judged necessary for the publick safety that said
Fort Pownall	PERSON	be immediately destroyed .

		That the
Militia	ORGANIZATION	marched for said place without delay , and on their way were overtaken by two officers of Colonel
McCobb	PERSON	's Regiment , informing that part of said Regiment , under command of Lieutenant Colonel
Harnden	PERSON	, was on the march to join them ; but as there was no prospect of an opportunity of comming to action with the enemy , this Regiment being so far ahead of them , and being now two hundred and seventy strong , was thought sufficient to accomplish every purpose now attainable ; and inasmuch as they came without boats , and your petitioners had not boats enough for the body now with them , their continuing their march was judged needless and inconvenient , and thereupon they returned .

		That your petitioners , proceeding on their march to
Fort Pownall	LOCATION	, took two sloops which they found in the employ of carrying necessaries to
Boston	LOCATION	, with a protection from Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	.

		Intelligence was received of several others in the same circumstance at
Majabigwaduce	LOCATION	, whereupon a party was dispatched thither , which took a sloop loading for
Nantucket	LOCATION	, together with another sloop and schooner just come from
Boston	LOCATION	, and bound thither again , with protection from the Admiral .

		The rest of said Regiment meanwhile went forward , and after assisting Colonel -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Goldthwait	PERSON	in removing his effects out of said Fort to the Chapel , and saving what shot , lead and old iron they could , burnt the building to the ground , and then brought off a barge belonging to the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, which had been employed in the service of the
Fort	LOCATION	.

		That your petitioners then reconnoitred the bay , and found the enemy 's fleet to remove from place to place sundry times , and to take such posts as made it evident their design was rather to avoid than intercept them .

		That finding their provisions all spent , and themselves in a country where the necessities of the inhabitants forbod the hope of any supply from them , your petitioners were obliged to return home ; accordingly the vessels above mentioned were brought to sail , and arrived safe in
Townsend Harbour	LOCATION	, in this Town , on Tuesday the first of this instant .

		That on their return , your petitioners find that they would have been supplied with provisions from the Town of
Bristol	LOCATION	, had not one of the aforesaid persons , by whose means the enemy was alarmed from
Camden	LOCATION	, prevented their sending them , after part was put on board of these vessels to convey them to your petitioners .

		That soon after their arrival , your petitioners met in council to deliberate on what might be proper to be done with the vessels now in custody , and the persons who commanded them ; and a regard for the publick safety induced your petitioners to order them to be hauled up , stripped and kept under a constant guard till the pleasure of the honourable Court is known ー except the schooner , which for particular reasons , your petitioners have delivered to Major
Andrew Reed	PERSON	, of this Town , to be employed in defence of this coast , and in suppressing trade with the enemy , until the orders of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	concerning her shall be received .

		The masters of said vessels appeared to your petitioners to have offended rather out of ignorance than ill intent , and therefore were dismissed ー
Nathan Philips	ORGANIZATION	,
Peleg Cruger	PERSON	and
Jonathan Carleton	PERSON	, then sick on shore and incapable of being removed , except who were by plenary evidence found guilty of having made it their business for some time past to supply the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Troops with wood , live stock and whatever other provisions they could procure ; and therefore your petitioners judged it not for the safety of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and especially the eastern country , to suffer said persons to go at large .

		Your petitioners have for that reason referred them to the sentencc of the honourable Court , and for that purpose do now send the two former to your Honours by the escort of Major
Edward Emerson	PERSON	, an officer of said Regiment , who has been with your petitioners through the whole of the expedition here narrated , and to whom your petitioners can safely refer the honourable Court for a perticular account of every circumstance attending it .

		Your petitioners pray that the honourable Court would take order respecting the premises , and on the first signification of your Honour 's pleasure , the said sloops , schooner , boats , & c. shall forthwith be disposed of agreeably thereunto .

		And your petitioners in duty bound shall ever pray .

		By a return express who left the

Richmond	LOCATION	at the falls of the
James River	LOCATION	on the 17th of last Month , where they resolved to raise 3000 Infantry and three troops of Horse for the defence of the lower parts of this Colony and I am likewise informed that one hundred men are to be raised in each of the upper counties who are to hold themselves in readiness to March when called upon , and they propose emitting three hundred thousand Pounds in paper Currency for the payment of these troops , and those that were out under my Command last year against the Indians , they have laid their hands on all the publick Monies in the Receiver and Auditor Generals Offices , also on that in the Post Masters and Naval Officers , to a considerable amount ; they have also prohibited the exportation of all sorts of Provisions from the 5th of this Month , which has given great disgust to many of their own party who had purchased great quantities of Grain which they meant to have exported before the 10th of September the time appointed by the
General Congress the Merchants of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	have petitioned the Convention for further time , but with what Success is not known .

		Tho ' the proceedings of the
General Congress	ORGANIZATION	do not transpire , I have every reason to believe that they have ordered an
Army	ORGANIZATION	to be immediately raised -LRB- Stiled the
Continental Army	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- they have also appointed a
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	and are to emit a very large Sum of paper Money , which is to have Currency all over the Continent ; the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is to be the Legislative body , the executive power is in the

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO
NICHOLAS COOKE	PERSON	, DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF
RHODE ISLAND	LOCATION	1 Sir : Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, August 4 , 1775 I am Yesterday favored with yours of the 31st July ; We have yet no certain Accounts of the Fleet which Sail 'd out of
Boston	LOCATION	the 25th ; but if our Conjectures and Information are just we may expect to hear of it every Hour .

		I am now , Sir , in strict Confidence to acquaint you , that our Necessities in the Articles of Powder and Lead are so great as to require an immediate Supply .

		I must earnestly intreat you will fall upon some Measures to forward every Pound of each in the Colony which can possibly be spared ; It is not within the Propriety of Safety of such a Correspondence to say which I might on this Subject ; It is sufficient that the Case calls loudly for the most strenuous Exertions of every friend of his Country and does not admit of the least delay .

		No Quantity , however Small , is beneath notice and should any arrive , I beg it may be forwarded as soon as Possible ; But a Supply of this kind is so precarious , not only from the Danger of the Enemy , but the opportunity of Purchasing , that I have resolved in my mind every other possible chance , and listned to every proposition on the subject which could give the smallest Hope ; Among others I have had one mentioned which has some Weight with me , as well as the General Officers to whom I have proposed it one
Harris	PERSON	is lately come from
Bermuda	LOCATION	, where there is a very considerable Magazine of Powder in a remote Part of the Island and the Inhabitants well disposed not only to our Cause in General , but to assist in this Enterprize in particular ; we understand there are two Armed Vessels in your Province commanded by Men of known Activity and
Spirit	ORGANIZATION	; one of which it is proposed to despatch on this Errand , with such other assistance as may be required ;
Harris	PERSON	is to go along as the Conductor of the Enterprize , and to avail ourselves of his knowledge of the Island , but without any Command .

		I am very sensible that at first view the project may appear hazardous and its Success must depend on the Concurrence of many Circumstances ; but we are in a Situation which requires us to run all Risques .

		No Danger is to be considered when put in Competition with the Magnitude of the Cause and the Absolute Necessity we are under of increasing our Stock .

		Enterprises , which appear Chimerical , often prove successful from that very Circumstance , Common Sense & Prudence will Suggest Vigilance and care , when the Danger is Plain and obvious , but where little Danger is apprehended , the more the enemy is unprepared and consequently there is the fain 'd Prospect of Success .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	2 has been mentioned to me as a very Proper Person to consult upon this Occasion you will judge of the Propriety of communicating it to him in Part or the whole , and as soon as possible , favor me with your Sentiments and the Steps you may have ' taken to forward it .

		If no immediate and safe Opportunity offers you will please to do it by Express .

		Should it be inconvenient to part with one of the armed Vessels , perhaps some other might be fitted out , or you could devise some other Mode of executing this Plan ; so that , in case of a Disappointment , the Vessel might proceed to some other
Island	LOCATION	to purchase ... Since writing the above Col.

		His Lord-ship it is said , as soon as they arrive , and when joined by the marines from the Mercury and Otter men of war , and a number of other select friends in different places , intends corning round to

Kirkland	LOCATION	, which according to the Accounts transmitted -LRB- I believe before you set out -RRB- 2 bears a very dark and suspicious aspect ; an Enquiry may be made in such manner as to give no alarm , & if proper proofs can be come at , it will be highly necessary , when the Time will allow it , to inflict such punishment as his Crimes deserve ; as the matter has been represented he has certainly been guilty both of Mutiny & Desertion .

		That the Captain exulted much of the discoveries he had made , and my Informer , who was also in the Boat but released , understood them to be Letters of consequence .

		I have therefore , dispatch 'd the Express immediately back , tho ' I had before resolved to detain him 'till -LSB-

Lighthouse Island	LOCATION	, on information being given that the King 's troops were rebuilding it ; the enemy perceived our people coming , prepared to receive them ; our troops were ordered not to fire until they landed , which they did , and went boldly up to the enemy , killed ten or twelve on the spot , among whom was the commanding officer , and took the remainder , about thirty-five in number , demolished the enemy 's works , and were preparing to embark , but the tide leaving them , they were obliged to tarry till its return ; mean time a large number of boats from the men of war came up in order to reinforce t , he enemy on the island , and a smart firing from both parties commenced ; our troops however got safely back with their prisoners , with the loss of one man killed , and two or three wounded .

Sir Boston	ORGANIZATION	Aug 5 , 1775 I am sorry to give your Excellency farther trouble to explain what I thought had been clearly expressed in My last letter with respect to the Symmetry .

Authority	ORGANIZATION	he could not perform the Service expected from that Armed Vessel , And your Excellency in your letter Augt 1 .

		by that officer Mentions that you are under the Necessity of ordering her away ー In that Case I proposed the Scorpion should take her birth , And that until the Scorpion Could Come up , I would send a Lieutenant to Command the Symmetry , if it was agreeable to your Excellency ー I intended Nothing More than to Make the Symmetry useful apprehending Authority alone in the officer wanting for that purpose ; And Your Excellency I hope will believe that the good of the Service alone dictated that proposal and No desire or wish of mine to interfere in your Excellency 's department .

		I beg leave however to offer my opinion that the Symmetry Might remain as she is Commanded by the Agent , and Supported by the Scorpion , until I have it in My power to put a twenty Gun Ship there as I have already promised .

Boston	LOCATION	5th of August 1775 Yesterday I received two Letters from the Captains of His Majs .

		Ships Somerset and
Boyne	LOCATION	ー Captain -LSB-
Broderick	PERSON	-RSB-
Hartwell	PERSON	says the Night before last forty Whale Boats , and three large Boats with Masts assembled under
Moon Island	LOCATION	; He thinks the Rebels in them will attempt to burn some of the King 's Ships , and that they are probably encouraged to such a proceeding from their knowledge how few Men are in them ; The Captains , above mentioned , have stated the numbers deficient in their Ships which from debarkations at
Boston	LOCATION	, Deaths , Sickness , short of Complement , and Men employed in the Symmetry and Scows amount to upwards of One hundred and fifty in the
Somerset	LOCATION	, and near two hundred in the
Boyne	LOCATION	.

		Things being in this Situation I am under the necessity of acquainting your Excellency , that I think the immediate Safety of His Majesty 's Ships require all their People to be Onboard , as their Security and defence , in Case of Attacks , must be in their Boats and Musquetry .

		It would give me great Satisfaction therefore if your Excellency could fall upon some other Methods to Man the Scows and Symmetry , or in lieu of the Men in these Vessels spare as many Marines to the Men of War .

		I beg leave to assure your Excellency that the preservation of the King 's Ships alone occasions this Representation , and that however you may determine I shall invariably continue to afford You every assistance in my Power for the good of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Service ー I have the Honor to be with great Respect Sir , -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		The Movements of the Rebels Boats Occasion much Talk and Speculation ; and many think they might be shut up in some of the
Islands	LOCATION	on which they frequently land , and give
Time for Boats	ORGANIZATION	and Troops to be got ready to attack them on Shore , and that the Lively might have taken the whole when they last attacked the
Light House	ORGANIZATION	.

Thomas -RSB- Musgrave	PERSON	informs that near One Hundred Whale Boats were seen this Morning at or near
Thompson 's Island	LOCATION	: Some Fisherman Report they were seen passing the
Light House	ORGANIZATION	, and some suppose they mean coming down the Mystick way , which is unguarded .

		MAJOR GENERAL
PHILIP SCHUYLER	PERSON	TO
JOHN HANCOCK	PERSON	, PRESIDENT OF THE
CONTINENTAL CONGRESS	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir , Tionderoga August 6th .

		1775 .

		I enclose you a Copy of a Report made me by the Master of the Schooner on
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, confirming the Account that Vessels of Force are building at
St Johns	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Accounts of the Persons employed in taking and garrisoning Crown Point & this Place are involved in such a Cloud of Confusion , that I shall find it very difficult to execute your Orders on this Head with Precision .

		The
Colony of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	has paid some Part of the Money ; so has the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and a small Sum has been advanced by me .

		It will be necessary therefore that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should order the Accounts from those Colonies to be transmitted to me , -LRB- together with the Return of the Men as made to them -RRB- specifying who the People were that have received Money , in which Case I can take the Receipts in full , charge the whole Amount in my Accounts , & give Credit for what has been advanced by others .

		By the Return I have already recd I find that the same Men are charged in two or three different Accounts ; so that none can be paid until the whole are returned , however necessitous they may be , and many of them are most truly so .

		Two Days after my Arrival here I gave such Orders respecting the issuing of Provisions that I hoped an effectual stop would have been put to any future Misapplication , in which I have been disappointed .

		In mentioning this I do not mean to impeach the Integrity of the Men employed .

		I believe them honest and well meaning : but however willing they were to obey , they were so ignorant of Forms , that it was not easy for them to get into a proper Train , and therefore I ordered the Deputy Commissary General to send up a Person -LRB- whom I named and knew to be equal to the Task -RRB- to give them such explicit Directions and Forms , as that they will not hereafter labour any Difficulties to discharge their Duty with Propriety & Regularity , and Mr
John N. Bleeker	PERSON	is now employed for that essential Service .

		Out of about five Hundred Men that are here , near one hundred are sick , and I have not any
Kind of Hospital Stores	ORGANIZATION	, altho I had not forgot to order them immediately after my Appointment .

		The little Wine I had for my own Table , I have delivered to the Regimental Surgeon .

		That being expended I can no longer bear the Distress of the sick , and impelled by the Feelings of Humanity , I shall take the Liberty immediately to order a Physician from
Albany	LOCATION	-LRB- if one can be got there , as I believe there may -RRB- to join me with such Stores as are indispensably necessary .

		If
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should approve of this Measure they will please to signify what Allowance of Pay will be made ー If not I shall discharge the Person whoever he be , paying him for the Services he may have performed .

		Lieutenant Col -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Mott	PERSON	is still here .

		I am at best but a very indifferent Judge of the engineering Business ; but from -LSB- what -RSB- I can discover he appears to me as well qualified as any Gentleman that can be got , who is not regularly bred to the Business .

		I am sure he is active and has the Service much at Heart , and I could wish if his Appointment is to be confirmed , that his Commission might be transmitted me .

		It is more than probable that before I can receive your Answer to this Letter , I shall have a Sufficiency of Boats to transport what Troops I am likely to have to
St Johns	PERSON	if I should be ordered there -LRB- for , after deducting what will be absolutely necessary to garrison these Places , and bring a Supply of Provisions , I shall , at most , have only twelve Hundred Men -RRB- In that Case I wish to be informed what I am to do with the Carpenters that are here ; for altho I think it necessary to build more Boats , yet I ought to know whether
Congress	ORGANIZATION	means that I should build a naval Force superior to that of the Enemy .

		If so , I must keep them , and beg some more good Builders .

		The Boats I have found on the Lake are so bad , that the Labour we have bestowed upon them is in a great Measure lost .

		As the Commander of the Sloop has left her , of which I was advised on my Anival at
Albany	LOCATION	, I wrote to the
New York Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	to send me up a Man , which they have accordingly done , and I am just now informed that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has appointed another .

		2 If so , I beg the Directions of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, how I am to dispose of Capt -LSB-
James -RSB- Smith	PERSON	the present Commander .

		LETTER FROM `` A TRAVELLER '' TO THE EDITOR OF
BOSTON	LOCATION
GAZETTE	ORGANIZATION	IN
WATERTOWN	ORGANIZATION	1
Watertown	LOCATION	, August 7 , 1775 Since I came out of
Boston	LOCATION	, where I left all my effects to the mercy of a lawless banditti , to amuse myself have made several excursions into different parts of the country , and with pleasure have observed the firm , steady , and resolute spirit which animates every individual .

		My last tour was to
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, where , to my astonishment , and I dare say to the astonishment of all
America	LOCATION	, I was informed , that the
Committee for that Town	ORGANIZATION	had voted to supply the
Scarborough	PERSON	man-of-war , lying in their river , with from four to six hundred weight of fresh beef weekly .

		This account , I must confess , appeared to be scarce credible ; but on making farther inquiry , found it too true ; and the reason assigned for this conduct was owing to the threats of a paltry sloop-of-war to deprive the inhabitants of fresh fish , unless they afforded them such a quantity of beef .

		Too great a soul I hoped animated the breast of every American to submit to so insolent a demand ; and instead of treating it with the contempt such insolence deserved , to the surprise of many of the worthy inhabitants , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	passed a vote to supply with provisions those butchers of our countrymen , who are daily pilfering and destroying our property , and exercising every act of cruelty to distress and destroy us , by this unexampled instance submitting to their imperious demands , and , like suppliants , entreating their favour .

		Such conduct , at so important a crisis , can not but wring tears from every well-wisher to
America	LOCATION	.

		This fact is of so important a nature , that it ought in justice to be made publick ; and I hope it will so affect the minds of the worthy inhabitants of that Town , as to exclude from all further service the timid members of a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	who act in direct opposition to both
Continental	ORGANIZATION	and
Provincial Congresses	ORGANIZATION	.

Virginia	LOCATION	with the purport of his Letter , And beg leave to remark that I never was present when his Lordship and Captain
Macartney	PERSON	had any Consultations , what comes to my knowledge is as follows ー On Captain
Macartney	PERSON	's Arrival in his Majesty 's Ship Mercury at

Fowey	LOCATION	and asked me that
State of the Country	PERSON	, And if I went onshore .

		I answered that I looked upon the People to be in a State of Rebellion and thought it was dangerous to go , that the next day being the 12th of July last , Captain
Macartney	PERSON	came Onboard the Fowey to wait on his Lordship , and afterwards went onshore to wait on the President of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	; On his return from the President 's Onboard the Fowey Captain
Macartney	PERSON	told his Lordship that he was to dine with the President that day , and that his Lordship told him it was imprudent , as the President was a Man disaffected to Government , and that at his house he would most likely meet some who were then under Arms and in actual Rebellion .

		And that his Lordship used many Arguments to shew the impropriety of Accepting the invitation without effect , As he went and dined with the President , And , that at that time there were three or four hundred Armed Men in the Town ; from the nature of Circumstances the foregoing can not be otherwise than Awkward ; And are the facts that come to my knowledge Sign 'd Geo :

		Said vessel had on board of her , twelve soldiers from the shore , eight seamen , the captain , two mates , and steward , which was in number twenty-three men ; and our number was twenty-one whites , and five blacks .

		GEORGE WASHINGTON TO THE
NEW YORK PROVINCIAL CONGRESS	ORGANIZATION	1
Gentn Camp	ORGANIZATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, August 8 , 1775 It must give great concern to any Considerate Mind , that , when this whole Continent , at a vast Expense of Blood and Treasure , is endeavouring to Establish Liberties on the most secure and Solid Foundations , not only by a laudable
Opposition of Force to Force	ORGANIZATION	, but denying itself the usual advantages of Trade ; there are men among us so basely sordid as to Counteract all our Exertions , for the sake of a little Gain .

		You can not but have heard that the Distresses of the Ministerial Troops , for fresh Provisions and many other Necessaries , ー at
Boston	LOCATION	, were very great ; It is a Policy , Justifiable by all the Laws of War , to endeavour to increase them ; Desertions , Discouragement , and a Dissatisfaction with the Service , besides weakening their strength , are some of the Natural Consequences of such a Situation ; and , if continued , might afford the fairest Hope of Success , without further Effusion of human Blood .

		A vessel cleared lately out of
New York	LOCATION	for
St. Croix	LOCATION	, with fresh Provisions and other Articles , has just gone into
Boston	LOCATION	, instead of pursuing her Voyage to the
West Indies	LOCATION	; I have endeavoured to discover the Name of the Captain or Owner , but , as yet , without success ; The Owner -LRB- it is said -RRB- went to
St. Croix	LOCATION	before the Vessel , from which and her late arrival , I make no doubt you will be able to discover and expose the Villain .

		And , if you could fall upon some effectual Measures , to prevent the like in future , it would be doing a
Signal Service	ORGANIZATION	to our Common Country .

		I have been endeavouring , by every means in my Power , to discover the future Intentions of our Enemy here I find a General Idea prevailing thro ' the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and in the Town of
Boston	LOCATION	, that the Troops are soon to leave the Town and go to some other Part of the Continent .


New York	LOCATION	is the Place generally mentioned as their Destination .

		I should think a Rumour or Suggestion of this kind worthy of very little Notice , if it was not confirmed by some corresponding Circumstances .

		But a four Weeks total Inactivity , with all their Reinforcements arrived and recruited ; the daily Diminution , by Desertions , Sickness and small Skirmishes , induce an Opinion , that any Effort they propose to make , will be directed elsewhere .

		I thought it proper just to hint to you what is probably intended ; you will then consider what Regard is to be paid to it , and what steps will be proper for you to take , if any .

NICHOLAS COOKE	PERSON	, DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF
RHODE ISLAND	LOCATION	, TO GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	1 Sir Providence August 8th 1775 Last evening Col.
-LSB- Elisha -RSB- Porter	PERSON	delivered me your Letter of the 4th instant , to which I have paid all the Attention the importance of it demands .

		This Colony the last Fall , not confiding entirely in the precarious Supply of Powder that might be expected from the Merchants , imported a considerable Quantity , though not so large as was ordered .

		The supplying the Inhabitants , who were in a Manner utterly destitute , the
Army	ORGANIZATION	near
Boston	LOCATION	, and our armed Vessels have so exhausted this Stock that the Powder not left which is all in this Place , it greatly insufficient to resist even a short Attack upon it .

		Our Situation is the same with Respect to Lead .

		So that at present none of either Article can be spared from the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		By a Vessel which arrived here on the 30th Ulto from
Cape Francois	LOCATION	we are informed that the Captain of the Vessel sent from this port to the
Cape	LOCATION	for a Quantity of warlike Stores , in which the
Committee of Safety for the Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	had interested themselves , had excuted his
Commission	ORGANIZATION	and was to sail with a large Quantity in a Day or Two , so that she may be hourly expected .

		ー This Colony about Four Weeks ago despatched a suitable Vessel with money to purchse Fifteen Tons of Powder and other warlike Stores , which may also soon be expected .

		ー Of these Vessels we have the highest reason to think the enemy have gained Intelligence ; the Ships of War upon this Station having for several Days past cruised continuaIly off
Block-Island	LOCATION	, and from thence to Montauk-Point , and up the Sound .

		This hath made us think it absolutely necessary to send the smallest of our armed Sloops to cruise without the Ships of War , and endeavour , at all Hazards to speak with the Vessels expected with Powder , and order them to another Port .

		ー She will sail this day .

		ー The other armed Sloop , by her being within the river , prevents the Cutters and Barges from committing Depredations ; so that she can not be spared : Nor indeed is a Vessel of her Force required for the Enterprise you mention .

		ー We have in this Harbor a very fine sailing Packet that would answer the Purpose extremely well ; which might be equipped with Swivels , manned with about Twenty Men and be ready to sail in less than Two Days .

		But as I do not think it prudent that her sole Dependence should be upon getting Powder at
Bermuda	LOCATION	it will be necessary to send a Sum of Money to purchase a Quantity at some other Port in Case of a Disappointment at
Bermuda	LOCATION	.

		In the present State of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	I do not think it probable that a sufficient Sum can be procured here for that Purpose before the Sitting of the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	; and therefore advise that Application be made to the General
Court of the Massachusetts-Bay	PERSON	to advance part of the sum necessary .

		I believe we may be able to supply One Half the Sum here .

		ー Col.
Porter	PERSON	hath been at
Bedford	LOCATION	and along the Eastern shore , but can hear nothing of
Harris	PERSON	.

		He is now bound as far as New-London to endeavour to meet with him ; but is greatly apprehensive that he is fallen into the Hands of the Enemy .

		We have information that several Ships of War and Transports were the Day before Yesterday at
New-London	LOCATION	; and that the Country round were all arming and mustering .

		We also hear that they have taken some stock off the east end of
Long-Island	LOCATION	.

		Sensible of the great scarcity of lead in the country , I some time ago wrote to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
Massachusetts-Bay	LOCATION	and to our Delegates at the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	recommending that a part of the large Quantity of lead at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	should be immediately brought down ; and still think the Measure necessary .

		I shall immediately give Orders to the
Committee of Safety	ORGANIZATION	to purchase for the Use of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	all the
Tow-Cloth	LOCATION	that can be had .

		If the Powder supposed to be at
Bermuda	LOCATION	be private Property it must be immediately paid for .

		If not I imagine it will be settled with our own Disputes .

		This is a matter that ought to be known and provided for .

		ー Upon further Consideration I am very doubtful whether a Vessel can be immediately provided with Men here ; and therefore am of opinion that Twenty five or Thirty Sailors had best be draughted from the Army & held in Readiness to embark immediately upon the Arrival of
Harris	PERSON	.

		This letter waits upon you by my Son , whom I beg Leave to recommend to your favourable Notice .

This afternoon at 4 o'clock , I received your orders of the 7th instant ; agreeably to which I immediately went to the militia to give them orders to be in readiness at a minute 's warning , and on my way to the Oyster Ponds I met an express from the committee of the Oyster Ponds to the committee at
Southhold	LOCATION	, informing them , that this morning , at 10 o'clock , the Ministerial fleet , consisting of thirteen sail of square rigged vessels , of which seven are ships , arrived from the west end of
Fisher	PERSON	's island and came to an anchor off
Gardiner	PERSON	's island point , where they now lie .

		At 5 o'clock this afternoon , a small boat , which our people took to be a passage boat , attacked Mr.

		He had landed about thirty on the north side of
Oyster Pond	LOCATION	point , when said boat ran in shore and fired upon Mr
Tuthill	PERSON	, drove him from his boat , and immediately took his boat with the remaining twenty sheep and carried them off .

		Upon receiving the express , I immediately sent an express to the officers of the militia to repair to

NEW ENGLAND	LOCATION	CHRONICLE , THURSDAY , AUGUST 10 , 1775
Cambridge	LOCATION	, August 10 .

		Our People have taken two or three of the Enemy 's Vessels at
Machias	LOCATION	, at the Eastward , with a Number of Prisoners , among whom is
Ichabod Jones	PERSON	, a well known Tory , who was brought to Town Yesterday , and put into Custody of the Main Guard .

		The other Prisoners , we are informed , are on the Road , and may be hourly expected .

		We hear from
Cape-Ann	LOCATION	, that a Vessel bound in there from the
West Indies	LOCATION	, being discovered off that
Harbour	PERSON	last Tuesday , several of the Inhabitants went off in a Boat to assist in bringing her in .

		Soon after , about 30 armed Men , from the Man of War commanded by Capt. -LSB-
John -RSB- Lindzee	PERSON	, 1 boarded and took Possession of the Vessel ; but she running aground on the
Cape	LOCATION	, was vigorously attacked by a Number of Men from the Town of
Glocester	LOCATION	, who soon obliged the Enemy to give up the Vessel to the proper Owners , and to surrender themselves Prisoners .

		The whole Number was immediately sent to
Ipswich Goal	ORGANIZATION	, in which 24 of them were confined .

		The Rest -LRB- 4 or 5 in Number -RRB- were discharged , it appearing that they had been cruelly forced into the
Enemy 's Service	ORGANIZATION	.


Lindzee	PERSON	was so enraged that he fired several Cannon Shot into the Town of
Glocester	LOCATION	, but did little Damage .

		The Information given us -LRB- and inserted in our last -RRB- respecting the Expedition to the Light-House , we have been since told , was rather imperfect .

		Maj.
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Tupper	PERSON	commanded the Troops , consisting of 250 .

		They found on the Island 53 Persons , 33 of them Marines , of whom a Lieutenant and two Privates , with three Tories were killed on the Spot .

		Five of the
Marines	ORGANIZATION	, and several of the Tories , were wounded , amo ` ng whom was the notorious Capt.
White	PERSON	of
Marshfield	LOCATION	.

		The whole Number , besides the killed , were made Prisoners , one of whom was the Master Carpenter from
New York	LOCATION	.

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO CAPTAIN
EDWARD LECRAS	PERSON	, R.N. 1 Whereas from the evil disposition towards his Majestys Government unfortunately spread throughout the Country , and from the more dangerous and wicked designs of those in actual Rebellion , there is every reason to apprehend his Majesty 's Yard and
Naval	ORGANIZATION	and
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	at
Halifax	LOCATION	to be in great danger of being destroyed , And whereas I have since the middle of last April kept his Majesty 's Ship Tartar at
Halifax	LOCATION	entirely for its Security ; you are hereby required and directed upon your arrival to take such measures for the preservation of the said Arsenal from Accident of Fire , or from any Attempts of the Rebels , as you shall think proper , and your situation and force will allow you to use .

		And whereas I am informed that the
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	as well for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	as the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	are deposited entirely out of the Protection of the Kings Ships , and that a very small Force may remove them without hindrance from the Men of War .

		You are to report to me as soon as possible your opinion thereon , and upon the manner his Majesty 's Yard is defended or secured at those places where the Kings Ships can not act ; and whether the removal of all or part of the
Ordnance Stores	ORGANIZATION	to
George	PERSON	's
Island	LOCATION	will not put them out of Danger from the Rebels .

		Reporting to me in general your opinion concerning the Security of his Majesty 's Yard and the Stores in both Departments , and what means are proper to be used to secure the whole from open or secret Attempts of the Enemy by Sea or Land .

		Given under my Hand on Board his

		CAPTAIN
JOHN LINZEE	PERSON	, R.N. , TO VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 Sir Nantasket Road August 10 1775 I beg leave to inform you that on the 8th inst cruizing off
Cape Anne	PERSON	in his Majesty 's Sloop under my Command I discovered two Schooners under Sail standing in for the Shore .

		I made Sail after them and very soon came up with the Sternmost and detained her ; the other got into
Cape Anne Harbour	LOCATION	whither I followed .

		On my anchoring the same day I sent
Lieutt Thornborough	PERSON	with the
Pinnace Long	ORGANIZATION	boat and Jolly Boat manned and armed in order to bring the Schooner out ; the Master coming in from Sea at the same time in a small Tender , I directed him to go and assist the Lieutt When the Boats had passed the Point of Rocks that was tbetween the Ship and Schooner ; they received a very heavy fire from the Rebels who were hidden behind Rocks and Houses and behind Schooners aground at Wharfs , but notwithstanding the Heavy fire from the Rebels ,
Lieutt Thornborough	PERSON	boarded the Schooner and was himself and three men wounded from the Shore .

		On the Rebels firing on the Boats I fired from the Ship into the Town to draw the Rebels from the Boats .

		I very soon observed the Rebels paid very little Attention to the firing from the Ship , and seeing their Fire continued very heavy in the Schooner , the
Lieutt	PERSON	had boarded , I made an Attempt to set fire to the Town of
Cape Anne	LOCATION	and had I succeeded I flatter myself would have given the Lieutt an Opportunity of bringing the Schooner off , or have left her by the Boats , as the Rebels Attention must have been to the fire .

		But an American , part of my Complement , who had always been very active in our cause , set fire to the Powder before it was properly placed ; Our attempt to fire the Town therefore not only failed but one of the men was blown up , and the American deserted .

		A second Attempt was made to set fire to the Town , but did not succeed .

		The Rebels coming to the Fort obliged the four men to leave it .

		I then began a second time to fire on the Town but the Houses being built of Wood could do no great Damage .

		About four o'clock in the Afternoon the
Lieutt	LOCATION	was brought on board under Cover of the Masters fire from the Schooner who could not leave her .

		All the Boats are much damaged by Shot ; and lay on the side of the Schooner next the Rebels .

		On my being made acquainted with the Situation of the Master I sent the Prize Schooner to anchor ahead of the Schooner the Master was in , and veer along side to take him and people away , who were much exposed to the Rebels fire ; but for want of an Officer to send in her it was not performed , the Vessel not anchored properly ; And as , I apprehend , the Master could not see any Prospect of being assisted , and a heavy fire from the Rebels , and numbers coming to their Assistance , delivered himself up about 7 in the Evening with the Gunner , fifteen Seamen , seven
Marines	ORGANIZATION	, one Boy and ten prest Americans .

		The Schooner I sent in to assist the Master on his going ashore , ran in and was retaken by the Rebels .

		I am inclined to think the Company of the Schooner had been hid and took that opportunity of retaking the Vessel that was sent to assist the Master .

		After the Master was landed I found I could not do him any good , or distress the Rebels by firing .

		I therefore left off .

		On this Occasion the Rebels took the Pinnace Jolly Boat three Swivels some small Arms and two small Anchors with one hawser that was to warp the Schooner out by .

		I remained at Anchor till the following Morning and then warped out in order to proceed to this place .

		1775 I have considered the Papers you left with me Yesterday ; those of them which relate to -LSB-
Ichabod -RSB- Jones	PERSON	shew him to be a malignant & inveterate Enemy to his Country and I trust he will meet with his Deserts ; but I have such various & important Matters requiring my constant Attention that I must beg Leave to refer him and all others under Similar Circumstances to the
Authority	ORGANIZATION	of the Province for punishment & safe Custody ... As to the Expedition proposed against
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	by the Inhabitants of
Machias	LOCATION	, I can not but Applaud their Spirit and Zeal , but after considering the Reasons offer 'd for it , there are Several Objections occur which seem to me unanswerable .

		I apprehind Such an Enterprize inconsistent with the General Principle upon which the Colonies have proceeded That Province has not acceeded , it is true , to the Measures of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; & therefore they have been excluded from all Commercial Intercourse with the other Colonies ; But they have not commenc 'd Hostilities against them , nor are any to be apprehended ー To attack them therefore is a Measure of Conquest rather than
Defence	ORGANIZATION	, & may be attended with very Dangerous Consequences ー It might perhaps be easy with the Force propos 'd to make an Excursion into the Province & overawe those of the Inhabitants who are Inimical to our Cause & for a short time prevent the Supplying the Enemy with Provisions ー but the
Same Force	ORGANIZATION	must Continue to produce any lasting Effects ー As to the furnishing
Vessells of Force	ORGANIZATION	; You Gentlemen will Anticipate me in pointing out our Weakness & the Enemy 's Strength at Sea ー There wou 'd be great Danger that with the best Preparation we could make , they would fall an easy Prey either to the Men of War on that Station or Some who would be Detach 'd from
Boston	LOCATION	ー I have been thus particular to
Satisfy any Gentlemen of the Court	ORGANIZATION	who should incline to adopt the Measure : I could offer many other Reasons against it , some of which I doubt not will suggest themselves to the Hon : Board ー But it is unnecessary to enumerate them when our Situation as to Amunition absolutely forbids our Sending a Single Ounce out of the Camp at presentー I am Gent & c 1 .

		I am satisfied as well from the Circumstances mentioned in your Dispatch , as from Information procured here , that the Rebels are meditating some mischief to
Halifax	LOCATION	and other parts in your Excellency 's Government ; And we have no Doubt that they will endeavour to interrupt the Navigation to and from the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	.

		The St.
Lawrence	PERSON	and
Hope armed Schooners	ORGANIZATION	sailed from
Boston	LOCATION	the 20th of last month to convoy two Transports going for Hay to
Annapolis	LOCATION	-LSB- Royal -RSB- , their Commanders have positive Orders to search for Pirates and to destroy them .

		They are to call at
Mechais	LOCATION	and to go as high as
Windsor	LOCATION	, if possible , to collect the Provision Vessels and bring them hither .

		The
Senegal	LOCATION	is with four Transports in
Penobscot Bay	LOCATION	and will attend them farther to the Eastward if necessary .

		And I have now ordered the
Scarborough	PERSON	to cruize in the Station your Excellency recommended , which is certainly the best to secure the Navigation of the
Bay	LOCATION	and adjacent Coast , and for intercepting
Pirates	ORGANIZATION	.

		If they can be once shut out from the
Bay	LOCATION	, our Cruizers will reduce them to the necessity of fighting , or of skulking where they can not annoy Vessels passing ; And I hope we shall soon give perfect Security to all legal Traders .

		I have not heard before of the Vessels at
Pemaquid	LOCATION	, but the Rebels will no Doubt get as many fitted out as they can , and it must be our business to destroy them .

		In my opinion there is very little dependence on the Natives in any of the Provinces , who are running blindfold into the worst of governments , and are at present so intoxicated with Notions of Deliverance as they call it from Slavery , and so perfectly submissive and obedient to the Commands of their
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that we must expect every Consequence of such Infatuation .

		Capt.
-LSB- Edward -RSB- LeCras	PERSON	while he stays at
Halifax	LOCATION	has full Power from me to assist your Excellency , and in general to take such steps for the immediate protection and security of every thing belonging to his Majesty as his Situation and Force will allow .

		And if your Excellency thinks it right to send Cannon and Ammunition to
Annapolis	LOCATION	, he will order Captain -LSB-
Edward -RSB- Medows	PERSON	to convey it there .

		Your Excellency may be assured that I shall do the utmost in my power at all times for the publick good , and receive with pleasure every Intelligence your Excellency can send me for that purpose .

		I am & c
Sam Graves	PERSON	P S. I beg leave to offer my opinion to your Excellency not to send Cannon or Ammunition , except where there is a sufficient Number of Regulars in
Garrison	LOCATION	.

		AN ACCOUNT OF THE FRACAS BETWEEN VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES AND
BENJAMIN HALLOWELL	PERSON	, ONE HIS MAJESTY 'S CUSTOM COMMISSIONERS 1 The affair happened on the 12th -LSB- sic 11th -RSB- of August -LSB- 1775 -RSB- ... The Admiral was going to the General 's , when Mr. H ------ ll made after and overtook him , and insisted upon an answer to some letters , but the Admiral said he would never answer them ; Mr. H ------ ll repeated his demands several times , and the Admiral always made the same reply : then says Mr. H ------ ll , you are no Gentleman but a Scoundrel upon which the Admiral hitting him a very slight slap in the face , drew his sword , and Mr. H ------ ll cried out , what draw a sword upon a naked man , give me a stick , a stone , and made a noise to bring people round him .

		The Admiral immediately returned his sword to the scabbard , and walked on slowly towards the General 's ; but Mr. H ------ ll picked up a stone , followed him again , and called out to speak to him , upon which the Admiral stopped to let him do so , imagining probably he meant to challenge him , when Mr. H ------ ll coming close up , in a low whispering voice said , you are a damned scoundrel , whereupon the Admiral struck with his fist with great resentment , cutting him across the nose with his knuckles so as to make the blood trickle , and a scuffle ensued .

		The mob , which had collected very fast , now pressed in and squeezed upon both , which gave an opportunity to Mr.
H	PERSON	------ ll to take away the Admiral 's sword , but a soldier perceiving this , caught hold of the sword , and in the struggle between them it was broke .

		I ca n't suppose , as some of the spectators fancied , that Mr.H ------ ll meant in his passion to stab the Admiral , but it looked to me if it had not been for the mob , the Admiral , although he must be near 60 , would have drubbed Mr. H ------ ll confoundedly , notwithstanding he is a stout young man of 34 or 35 years of age ; as it was , he was blind for a week as they told me .

		By Mr H ------ ll 's coming without a sword , it seemed plain that he designed to make a mobbish affair of it , and in such circumstances I do not see how the Admiral could act otherwise than he did .

		The true cause , or merits of the altercation I know nothing of myself , but it was reported that Mr. H ------ ll had long bore a grudge to the Admiral for bringing a relation -LRB- a Captain of a man of war -RRB- to a court martial for disobedience of orders ; although the immediate pretence for this attack I understood to arise from the Admiral 's not granting Mr. H ------ ll a pass for some men to go down the harbour to cut hay on Gallops island ; the Admiral 's friends gave out that he did not think it just or equal for any one man to engross -LRB- in a time of such scarcity -RRB- so much hay to himself , that the brother-in-law of Mr. H ------ ll commanded the man of war then near
Gallop	LOCATION	's island , that the army was in great want of provender for their horns there being 17 or 18 marines employed to cut grass for them , the ships generally weak in hands , and information received of 170 whaleboats having been drawn over a narrow neck of land with intent to burn and plunder the islands ; besides which , Mr. H ------ ll 's requests and letters were so improper , and in such gross and indecent terms , as to be entitled to no answer .

		I pretend however to form no judgment of the matter , and am a stranger to both parties .

		Mr. H ------ ll is a native of
Boston	LOCATION	, the son of a Carpenter , bred to the sea , much liked in the town , universally known to the navy and people , and bears a good character : the Admiral is counted by the fleet a good seaman and brave , and is very active , but somewhat severe , of few words , and rough in his manner .

		This account is contained in a letter from
Portsmouth	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, to
London Chronicle	ORGANIZATION	, written by a gentleman who stated , `` I came home from
Boston	LOCATION	in the transport lately arrived , and have since been shewn an article in a news-paper giving so unjustifiable an account of the scuffle in the streets between Admiral
Greaves	PERSON	and Commissioner
Holowell	PERSON	, that I think it a piece of justice to the public to relate what really passed , being by accident an eye and ear witness . ''

Chronicle	ORGANIZATION	in the Postscript of its issue of Oct. 31-Nov .

		WILLIAM LUX AND
MATTHEW RIDLEY	PERSON	TO THE
MARYLAND	LOCATION	CONVENTION 1 Gentlemen Annapolis August the 11th 1775 We are jointly with Mr
William Russell	PERSON	and Mr
Daniel Bowly	PERSON	of
Baltimore Town Owners of the Brig Nancy	ORGANIZATION	, Capt
Lund	PERSON	; Sometime in the month of May last we chartered this Brig to
Messrs Wallace Davidson & Johnson	ORGANIZATION	to load with Tobacco in
Potowmack	LOCATION	for
London	LOCATION	.

		She is now loaded and ready to clear out on her intended Voyage ; but she having lain longer by a considerable time than was expected in collecting her cargo , and the season having been remarkably dry ー the worms have injured her bottom to such a degree as to render her unfit to proceed to Sea : and before she can do so , her Cargo must be relanded and her Bottom sheathed .

		Work of this kind can not be done where she lays .

		We must have her up to
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		Under these circumstances , the work being tedious , we are apprehensive the Vessel can not be finishd previous to the loth of September .

		It is our wish to make Rules formed for the benefit of the Community , our line of Conduct , nor would we , we assure you Gentlemen , under any specious pretences , endeavour to infringe them .

		Our situation is a very peculiar one .

		We beg you will take it into consideration , and allow us , if not in our power to do it before , to reload the above Cargo after the 10th of September .

		The Vessel & Cargo shall be cleared out before .

		To obviate every suspicion that may arise of intentions to counteract the general Resolves , we desire to be sworn as to the fitness , and condition of the Vessel to take in her Cargo at the time of her going from
Baltimore	LOCATION	to
Potowmack	LOCATION	.

		We know the arduous business in which you are now engaged Gentlemen must take up much of your attentions ; ー We are sorry to be an interruption to it , but hope our situation will be a sufficient apology , as well as further excuse us , in desiring your speedy directions in this business .

		The Condition of the Vessel being such as to render some immediate steps necessary to be taken with her .

Baltimore County	LOCATION	, who are hereby empowered to examine and take the said proof , and if the said Vessel shall not be reladen and depart before 10th day of September next , then oath to be made before her departure , by the Captain and Mate , that no commodities , goods , wares or merchandise , is or shall be laden on board for Exportation , other than such as shall have been laden on Board , as part of her Cargo , before the said 10th day of September , and shall have been relanded '' .

Providence	LOCATION	, 12th Augst 1775 On my Return -LSB- from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RSB- I found the
People of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	in Arms for Sixty Miles ; a Fleet of twelve Sail of Men of war and Transports had been at the
Mouth of New London Harbour	ORGANIZATION	; an Attack was expected from them , but they only went to
Fishers Island	LOCATION	and got about 1000 Sheep and Lambs and 30 head of indifferent horned
Cattle	ORGANIZATION	, the only fat ones being brought off a few Days before .

		The Wretch who owns the Island had sold his Stock undoubtedly , for his Tenant had made yards down by the Sea and got his Sheep and Cattle ready for them before they landed ; the People deeply resent his Behaviour .

		The Fleet then stood for
Gardners Island	LOCATION	but a Number of armed Men probably prevented their Landing for they got no Stock save at Fishers Island : -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	and -LSB-
James -RSB- Ayscough	PERSON	and Part of this Fleet returned to
Newport	LOCATION	and again terrified the People by making every Preparation as if they intended instantly to fire upon them : They stopped the Ferry Boats , strictly examined every Person and took down the Names .

		They had heard of my Return and expected I should have gone to
Newport	LOCATION	and were in Hopes of getting one Delegate into their Possession ; They took the western Post Rider and propose to send the Mail to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I hope no Letters of Consequence may be in it , but however that may be this shews the impropriety of the Posts passing those Ferries .

Boston	LOCATION	by ministerial pirates , returned from thence to
Norfolk	LOCATION	last Wednesday -LSB- August 9 -RSB- , having on board seven officers of the regular army .

		We do not hear that any soldiers are come with them , or are to follow ; but it is certain that the Earl of

JOHN MACARTNEY	PERSON	, R.N. , TO
PAUL LOYALL	PERSON	, MAYOR OF
NORFOLK	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir , His Majesty 's Ship Mercury ,
Norfolk	LOCATION	, August 12 , 1775 .

		I am just informed by his Excellency Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	, that Mr.
Andrew Sprowle	PERSON	has received a summons to attend a
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in
Norfolk	LOCATION	, on Thursday next .

		The accusations alleged against him are of a most extraordinary nature .

		In the summons he is charged with having harboured His Majesty 's troops in the stores at
Gosport	LOCATION	.

		I am not surprised that a summons grounded upon such accusations should be alarming to Mr.
Sprowle	PERSON	; particularly after the cruel and oppressive treatment Mr. -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB- Schaw lately received from a mob in
Norfolk	LOCATION	.

		As I do most earnestly wish , and shall , upon all occasions , endeavour to promote the public peace of this province , I think it necessary to explain to you , as chief magistrate of the Town of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, the conduct I mean to pursue , in hope of preserving that peace and obedience to the laws , so ardently to be wished for by all loyal subjects and good citizens .

		I am sent hither to be the guardian of a British colony ; to protect His Majesty 's Governor , and all the loyal subjects in the Province of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		This is my duty , and should wish it to be known that my duty and inclination go hand in hand .

		The same principles which have induced me not to harbour the slaves of any individual in this province will operate with me to protect the property of all loyal subjects .

		As I have before observed , that I shall endeavour to promote the public peace of this province , it is hardly necessary to mention that I shall not remain an idle spectator , should any violence be offered to the persons or property of any of His Majesty 's subjects .

		I have reason to apprehend that many Gentlemen in this province , from their connexions with Government , or their readiness to supply His Majesty 's ships or servants with provisions , stores , & c. are held up as objects inimical to the liberties of
America	LOCATION	, and unjustly censured for their loyal conduct .

		Men under these circumstances are more particularlv entitled to my protection .

		I have not the least doubt , from your desire and readiness upon a former occasion to preserve harmony in the town of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, but you will heartily concur with me in my endeavours to suppress all party jealousies and animosities , so highly injurious to the welfare of a country .

		More effectually to perform my part , I shall , the first opportunity , place his Majesty 's ship under my command abreast of the town ; and I must assure you , that , notwithstanding I shall feel the utmost pain and reluctance in being compelled to use violent measures to preserve the persons and properties of his Majesty 's subjects , yet I most assuredly shall , if it becomes necessary , use the most coercive measures in my power to suppress all unlawful combinations and persecutions within the province of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		ST.
GEORGE TUCKER	PERSON	TO THOMAS
JEFFERSON	ORGANIZATION	1 Dear Sir
Bermuda Augst	PERSON	: 12th : 1775 Were I certain that a Letter I addressed to you a few Weeks ago , by way of
Virginia	LOCATION	had been delivered to you , I should not have intruded on Business of greater Importance in which you may be at present engaged , a second Time .

		But lest any Accident should have happened thereto , I take the Liberty of enclosing you the Plan for continuing the Exports from
America	LOCATION	to foreign Markets , which I hinted at in the Letter I took the Liberty of troubling you with in
Williamsburg	LOCATION	.

		Doctor -LSB-
Benjamin -RSB- Franklin	PERSON	has been addressed by my Father on this Subject , and he has enclosed a Plan for supplying this Island without Danger of infringing the continental Association .

		Should you think proper to communicate the enclosed to Doctor
Franklin	PERSON	, it may possibly serve as a Foundation for some more eligible superstructure .

		I am with the greatest Esteem for yourself and the most ardent Wishes in favor of that glorious Cause in which you are at present engaged , Dear Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-
St. George Tucker Proposal Concerning Bermuda	LOCATION	In order to continue the Exports from
America	LOCATION	to foreign Markets , it is proposed that all non-enumerated Goods be permitted to be imported into
Bermuda	LOCATION	from the Continent upon proper and sufficient Assurances from the Inhabitants of that Island that they will not infringe that part of the
Continental Association	ORGANIZATION	which relates to Exports .

		For this purpose the Cargoes must be discharged in
Bermuda	LOCATION	in order to obtain a certificate to cancel the Bond given at the
Custom Houses	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	in obedience to the restraining
Bill	PERSON	.

		In order to give a Colour to the Trade being carried on by the Inhabitants of
Bermuda	LOCATION	-LRB- since it might possibly endanger the success should it be carried on in the name of the Americans , as Hostilities have commenced between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the Continent , -RRB- the Invoices , Bills of Lading & c. should be made out there and executed in the Name of the Inhabitants of that Island .

		Perhaps it might not be amiss to appoint
Committees of Inspection	ORGANIZATION	, whose Business it should be to see that no Vessel should sail from any port on the Continent untill Charter Parties , or other Engagements be entered into for the landing such Commodities as should be taken on board , in
Bermuda	LOCATION	without Fraud or
Covin	PERSON	.

		A
Committee	ORGANIZATION	should likewise be appointed in
Bermuda	LOCATION	to prevent the re-exportation of any Commodities imported from the Continent , to any place except what the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	shall allow .

		And the same Precautions should there be taken as on the Continent .

		For the same Reasons that the Invoices and Bills of Lading should be made out in the name of the Agents in
Bermuda	LOCATION	, the Charter parties should also be executed in the same Manner .


Mediterranean	LOCATION	passes should be procured on the Continent as there may be some Difficulty in getting them in
Bermuda	LOCATION	.

		The above is respectfully submitted to the Consideration of
Thomas Jefferson Esquire	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	, by , His -LSB- & c. -RSB-

GLOUCESTER	LOCATION	,
CAPE ANN	ORGANIZATION	, TO
ISAIAH THOMAS	PERSON	,
WORCESTER	LOCATION	'' 1
Gloucester	LOCATION	, August 13 , -LSB- 1775 -RSB- On the 9th instant , the Falcon sloop of war , Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Lindzee	PERSON	hove in sight , and seemed to be in quest of two schooners from the West-Indies , bound to
Salem	LOCATION	, one of which he soon brought too ; the other taking the advantage of a fair wind , put into our harbour , but
Lindzee	PERSON	, having made a prize of the first pursued the second into the harbour , and brought the first with him .

		He anchored and sent two barges with fifteen men in each , armed with muskets and swivels , these were attended with a whale boat , in which were the Lieutenant and six privates ; their orders were to seize the loaded schooner , and bring her under the Falcon 's bow .

		The militia , and other inhabitants were alarmed at this daring attempt , and prepared for a vigorous opposition : The barge-men , under the command of the Lieutenant , boarded the schooner at the cabbin windows , which provoked a smart fire from our people on the shore , by which three of the enemy were killed , and the Lieutenant wounded in the thigh , who thereupon returned to the man of war .

		Upon this
Lindzee	PERSON	sent the other schooner and a small cutter he had to attend him , well armed , with orders to fire upon the damn 'd rebels wherever they could see them , and that he would in the mean time cannonade the town ; he immediately fired a broad side upon the thickest settlements , and stood himself , with diabolical pleasure to see what havock his cannon might make .

		`` Now , -LRB- said he -RRB- my boys , we will aim at the damn 'd presbyterian Church ー Well , my brave fellows , one shot more and the house of God will fall before you . ''

		While he was thus venting his hellish rage , and setting himself as it were against heaven , the Almighty was on our side ; not a ball struck or wounded an individual person , although they went through our houses in almost every direction when filled with women and children ; under God , our little party at the water-side performed wonders , for they soon made themselves masters of both the schooners , the cutter , the two barges , the boat , and every man in them , and all that pertained to them : In the action which lasted several hours , we lost but one man , two others wounded one of which is since dead , the other very slightly wounded .

		We took of the men of war 's men thirty-five , several were wounded and one since dead ; twenty-four were sent to head-quarters , the remainder being impressed from this and neighbouring towns , were permitted to return to their friends .

		Next day Capt.
Lindzee	PERSON	warped off with but half his men , never a prize , boat nor tender , except a small skiff the wounded Lieutenant returned in .

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO
NICHOLAS COOKE	PERSON	, DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- -LSB- Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	-RSB- August 14 , 1775 Sir : Your Favors of the 8th and 11th Inst are duly received ; the former , I laid before the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	of this Province , but one of the Delegates communicated to them what Mr.
-LSB- Samuel -RSB- Ward	PERSON	did to you , of the proceedings of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	touching this Powder , nothing was done towards the providing of Specie , that the Vessel might proceed to other Places in case of a Disap pointment at the first .

		I am of Opinion that the Collection of any considerable Sum here , would be difficult in the
Time	ORGANIZATION	proposed and I think there is the less Necessity for it , as there are few Colonies who have not some Vessel out on this Errand , and will probably bring all that is at Market .

		Having conversed with Col -LSB-
Elisha -RSB- Porter	PERSON	and farther considered the Matter , I am of Opinion , it ought to be prosecuted on the Single Footing of procuring what is in the Magazine ; The Voyage is short , our Necessity is great , the Expectation of being Supplied by the Inhabitants of the Island under such Hazards as they must run is slender so that the only Chance of Success is by a sudden stroke .

		There is a great Difference between acquiescing in the Measure and becoming Principals , the former we have great Reason to expect the latter is doubtful , The Powder by all our Information is public Property , so that as you observe it may be settled with our own Accounts .

		The draughting of Men from hence would be very difficult and endanger a Discovery of the scheme ; I am not clear that I have Power to send them off the Continent and to engage them as Volunteers , it would be necessary to make their Destination known ; I should suppose the Captain who is to have the Direction of this Enterprize , would rather choose to have Men whom he knew and in whom he could confide , in Preference to Strangers .

		From what
Col Porter	PERSON	informs me I do not see that
Harris	PERSON	's Presence is absolutely necessary , and as his Terms would add Considerably to the Expence , after obtaining from him all the
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	he could give , his Attendance might be dispensed with .

		The Vessel lately sent out to cruise for the Powder , seems to me the properest for this Voyage , and as the Ten Days will soon be out , if no objection occurs to you she might be dispatch 'd ... I had flattered myself , that the Vigilance of the Inhabitants on the
Islands	LOCATION	and Coasts would have disappointed the Enemy in their late Expedition after live Stock .

		ー I hope nothing will be omitted by the several Committees and other Persons to guard against any future attempts , by removing all the Stock from these Places , where their Shipping can protect them in plundering .

		I do assure you Sir , that it would be rendering a most essential Service to the Public Interest , their Distresses before were very great , and if renewed after their present supply is exhausted , must be productive of very great advantages .

John -RSB- Lindzee	PERSON	, boarded and took Possession of the Vessel ; but she running aground on the
Cape	LOCATION	, was vigorously attacked by a Number of Men from the Town of
Glocester	LOCATION	, who soon obliged the Enemy to give up the Vessel to the proper Owners , and to surrender themselves Prisoners .

		The whole Number was immediately sent to
Ipswich Goal	ORGANIZATION	, in which 26 of them were confined .

		The Rest -LRB- 4 or 5 in Number -RRB- were discharged , it appearing that they had been cruelly forced into the Eenmy 's Service .

BENJAMIN HALLOWELL	PERSON	TO GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	1 The letters wrote by Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	to Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	between the 3d and 20th of July last , respecting Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	's property and the conversation had on that subject , prior to the 11th .

		of august instant , being already laid before the General , he proceeds now to give a Narrative of what passed between them on that day .

		When Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	in the street saw the Admiral and as he could not get an answer to either of his letters , wished if possible to know the reason why his property was still detained from him which was so very detrimental , in consequence of which he then desired to speak with the Admiral on that business Who withdrew from a Gentleman that was with him to the side of the street , and when together Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	civilly asked the Admiral whether he had not received four letters from him ?

		and was answered in the Affirmative .

		Pray Sir , says Mr
Hallowell	PERSON	had you any particular reason for not answering any of them ?

		The Admiral replied , I did not choose it .

		Then Mr.
Hallowell Said	PERSON	when one Gentleman writes to another some kind of answer is expected .

		He again replied that he did not choose it ー then Mr.
Hallowell Said Sir	PERSON	, you do not use me like a Gentleman and was advancing to whisper the Admiral in the ear ー but was prevented by the Admiral 's throwing both his fists in Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	's face , and before Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	could recover himself from the two first he received a third Stroke ー Then the Admiral retir 'd and drew his sword and pointed it at Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	, on which , and not before , Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	told him that he was a rascal and a scoundrel and asked him if he was not ashamed to draw his Sword on a Naked Man Who had not even a Stick in his hand , and Adding these words `` for Shame , put it up , '' Which , after it had been sometime presented at Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	, he did .

		Then Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	made up to the Admiral and asked him what occasioned all this abuse , so unbecoming a Gentleman by Striking a Naked Man and drawing his Sword on him ?

		The Admiral immediately on this struck Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	again with his fist , which he returned and several blows passed between them .

		Then the Admiral retired a little and drew hi Sword a second time presenting it again at Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	who said `` for Shame put up your Sword You are No Gentleman to draw on a Naked Man . ''

		On Which the Admiral again returned his Sword .

		Then they closed and several blows pass 'd and lest the Admiral Should again draw his sword Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	wrested it from him and broke it , and then they were parted .

		Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	is informed that the Admiral declares that he called him rascal and Scoundrel before any blow was struck .

		This Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	Utterly denies , nor is it at all probable considering Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	was totally unarmed , had his gloves on during all this transaction , and must Naturally have expected , on the use of Such language , an attack from the Admiralー

		BRIGADIER GENERAL
DAVID WOOSTER	PERSON	TO
JONATHAN TRUMBULL	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Oyster Ponds , August 14 , 1775 Sir , Your favour of the 10th instant , with three hundred pounds of powder , per Captain
Griffin	PERSON	, I received ; and now acquaint your Honour that last Friday morning -LSB- August 11 -RSB- a large sloop of war and twelve transports sailed round Plumb Island .

		After they had got through the gut , I sent one hundred and twenty men in three boats , which were all the boats we then had , to said island , if possible to get off the stock , with orders to return immediately upon the first appearance of the enemy 's attempting to bring away any of their shipping between the island and
Oyster Pond Point	LOCATION	, lest their retreat might be cut off , it being impassible to support them without boats .

		Before the last boat had got over , the sloop of war was observed to be returning , and wind and tide favouring her , our boats were obliged to put back again , the hindmost of which had several cannon fired at her , but at so great a distance they did no damage .

		A cutter came within fifteen or twenty rods of our last , but discovering there were armed men in the boat , stopped their pursuit .

		Our soldiers in the boat , and some others on the beach , then fired at them , but I fancy to little effect , as our boat was obliged to make all sail possible to keep out of the reach of the cannon from the ship of war , which was close behind them .

		The sloop of war then came to anchor between the point and the island and that night took from the island nine cattle , and then joined the fleet , which came to very early on Saturday morning , and I suppose have gone to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		I have since taken from
Plumb Island	LOCATION	their cattle and sheep , and the inhabitants have engaged to thrash out their grain and convey it from the island as soon as possible .

		I shall to-morrow go to

PAUL LOYALL	PERSON	, MAYOR OF
NORFOLK	LOCATION	, TO CAPTAIN
JOHN MACARTNEY	PERSON	, R.N. ,
H.M.S. MERCURY	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir ,
Norfolk	LOCATION	, August 14 , 1775 .

		Since writing you yesterday , I find upon inquiry , that the summons referred to in your letter , was sent from a number of gentlemen who are freeholders , and compose the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of the County of
Norfolk	LOCATION	, and are therefore entirely without the jurisdiction of the magistrates of this corporation .

		I can only promise , that as the place of meeting for the purpose of considering Mr.
Sprowle	PERSON	's conduct is said to be within the limits of this Borough , I will take proper care that he shall not be molested or injured in his person by any riot or mob , if he thinks fit to attend on the committee .

		With respect to the treatment that Mr -LSB-
John -RSB- Schaw	PERSON	received , I was a stranger to it till the disturbance was over ; but can assure you , as soon as he put himself under the protection of a magistrate , he was secured from danger .

		The conduct which you are pleased to explain to me , as Chief Magistrate of this borough , as your intention to pursue in preserving peace and obedience to the laws , in the station assigned you by his Majesty , must be commended by every good man : By that care in your department , particularly in discouraging the elopement of slaves , which of late it is notorious has frequently happened , from the countenance shown them by some enemies to this colony , as well as to the British constitution , much mischief and confusion may be prevented .

		Your suggestion , that gentlemen are in danger , by supplying His Majesty 's Ships , & c. in this colony with provisions , I can not account for .

		I am very sure the contractors for the navy in this town are under no apprehensions of danger , as they have been assured to the contrary in the most explicit manner .

		I hope suspicions of this nature , prejudicial to the loyalty of a number of inhabitants , who are as much attached to the just prerogative of their Sovereign as any subjects in the Empire , may not be hastily taken up and adopted without full and satisfactory proof .

		I am much obliged by your favourable opinion of my readiness to concur in the suppression of all animosities : It has hitherto been , and I trust ever will be , the tenour of my conduct .

		I have always found the authority of the magistracy sufficiently competent for the maintenance of government and good order ; and while I t , hank you for your cheerful offers of assistance for that laudable purpose , yet I presume your intention is only to act within the line of your department .

		I confess I feel myself somewhat astonished at the last paragraph of your letter , which seems to me to imply a threatening that would eventually prove destructive to the persons and properties of his Majesty 's subjects .

		A personal insult offered to an individual , by the ill-guided zeal of a number of thoughtless youth , can never justify a hint of this nature .

		At any rate it is to be presumed , that Gentlemen .

		in military departments will not intermeddle in that capacity , unless particularly required by the civil authority ; as I am determined , whenever I find any unlawful combinations or persecutions to prevail within the sphere of my jurisdiction , to take every legal method to suppress them .

		I have nothing further to add , but the strongest assurances of the earnest desire of the inhabitants of this borough to live in the most perfect harmony with the Gentlemen of the navy , and hope that no little incident may interrupt it .

NICHOLAS COOKE	PERSON	, DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF

Benjamin Mumford	PERSON	who rides Post from
Newport	LOCATION	to
New London	LOCATION	was crossing the Ferry to
Newport	LOCATION	he was taken by Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	of the Ship Rose who broke open the Mails sent some of the Letters ashore and kept the Remainder in Order to send them to
Boston	LOCATION	ー He detained
Mumford	PERSON	until Yesterday .

		As the Mails will always be in the Power of the Ships of War so long as the
Post	ORGANIZATION	continues to cross the Ferries to
Newport	LOCATION	which will not only render all Intelligence precarious but may be the Means of giving such Informations as may be very prejudicial to the common Cause I take the Liberty of recommending that the Mails be brought through
Narragansett	LOCATION	directly to this Town instead of being carried to
Newport	LOCATION	; and that they be returned the same Way Mr -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Ward	PERSON	informs me that he delivered to you a copy of the Act of Assembly establishing Post-Offices and Post-Riders in this Colony .

		In that Act Mr
Nathaniel Otis	PERSON	was appointed Post-Master for

NORFOLK	ORGANIZATION	1 His Majesty 's Ship Mercury ,
Norfolk	LOCATION	, August 15 , 1775 .

		Sir , I was favoured with your letter of yesterday 's date , and it gives me much real satisfaction to find that the inhabitants of
Norfolk	LOCATION	are so earnestly desirous of living in harmony with his Majesty 's servants .

		You are pleased to assure me that no violence or insult shall be offered to the person of Mr.
Sprowle	PERSON	; and upon the faith of your letter I have requested him to attend the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to-morrow .

		For some days past I have been much indisposed , but if I find myself well enough to-morrow , I mean to accompany Mr.
Sprowle	PERSON	to the committee , and will call upon you about 11 o'clock to-morrow morning .

		I must beg that you will go along with us .

		You , I am sure , will agree with me that the summons sent Mr.
Sprowle	PERSON	-LRB- a copy of which I have enclosed you -RRB- must be truly alarming to all good citizens .

		When any set of Gentlemen assume to themselves the power of arraigning an individual for furnishing barracks for his Majesty 's troops , and pretend to censure a conduct , which I must think highly laudable , it gives me but too much reason to apprehend , that the authority of the civil magistracy is not competent for the support of government and good order .

Commons House of Assembly	ORGANIZATION	When I declined some time ago to comply with your request to adjourn , I too plainly foresaw the unhappy extremities to which many of the People in this Province were hast ` ning ; & had good grounds to apprehend I should want your advice , & assistance .

		ー Since that time I have been a Spectator of outrages I little expected ever to have seen in this place .

		I will confine myself to a very few .

		The Officers of the Crown have been call 'd on to give reasons for not signing an
Association	ORGANIZATION	, that was contrary to every tie of Duty & Allegiance .

		I now see the same Officers Summon 'd in the like arbitrary , & illegal manner , to have an Oath tender 'd to them equall incompatible with their Consciences , & honor .

		The barbarous outrage committed in the Streets of this Town on a poor , helpless , wretched , individual , with the particular circumstances of Cruelty , & Insult , I forbear to dwell on .

		In a word Gentlemen you well know the powers of Government are wrested out of my hands .

		I neither can protect , nor punish ; therefore with the Advice of His Majys Council I apply to You , & desire that in this dreadful emergency You will aid me with all the assistance in Your power , in enforcing the Laws , & protecting His Majys Servants , & all other peaceable , & faithfull Subjects , in that quiet possession of their liberty , & property , which every Englishman boasts , it is his Birth Right to enjoy , or You must candidly acknowledge all Law , & Government is at an end .

		ー Sorry I am to add that Some particular Insults offer 'd to myself , makes it necessary that I should be assured of the Safety of my own Family , & that its Peace is not in any danger of being invaded .

Halifax	LOCATION	August 16th 1775 Sir Since my last Letter to your Excellency I have entered into an Agreement with Mr.
Barton	PERSON	for procuring the number of Ship Carpenters & Seamen you proposed to be raised here , and I was informed by him Yesterday that he had procured Thirty Six in the whole about one half Carpenters and the other Seamen , that he could have compleated the whole number before now ; but chooses to have such men as will Answer the purposes for which they are designed , & that he shall soon compleat the number & be ready for embarkation as soon as the Vessel arrives .

		I enclose your Excellency a Copy of my Agreement with him containing the Terms & Conditions , upon which they are to enter into the Service .

		Your Letter of the 29th July last I have received & would observe to your Excellency that the Militia of this Province are not to be depended on case an Attempt should be made on this Province by the People of the Eastern Parts of
New England	LOCATION	, as most of them especially in that part of the Country are from
New England	LOCATION	, & am very Doubtful whether the greater number are not too much of the same Sentiment with the People of the Country from whence they are derived .

		By Advices from
Machias	LOCATION	, it is now rendered certain Mr.
Knight	PERSON	is taken & both his Vessels .

		That a Vessel has lately arrived there from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	sent by the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	with Provisions That
OBrien	PERSON	who commanded the Vessel fitted out to Cruize for the Provision Vessels Bound from this Province with Cattle & other Provision , is gone to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	for orders , that another Person commands her .

		We are informed that along the
Eastern Coast	ORGANIZATION	several small Vessels are fitting out for the like purpose so that Navigation between
Boston	LOCATION	& this Province will become uncertain & Dangerous That I have had these matters before His Majesty 's Council & the Copy of the Letters , & their result thereupon will herewith be Transmitted to your Excellency .

		I had ordered the new Recruits being about 36 Men with their Officers to march to
Windsor	LOCATION	about 40 Miles Distant from hence , where the Vessels & Stock now are waiting for Convoy .

		I had Advice from hence that they woud be in Danger not only from the
Pirates	ORGANIZATION	at
Machias	LOCATION	who have been into the
Bason	PERSON	of Minos but from some evil minded People of this Province , & that this was a most necessary measure for their Protection but the Officers have refused , as your Excellency will perceive by their Letter here inclosed .

		I can not but observe to your Excellency that this kind of behaviour of his Majesty 's Officers will have a tendency to render them entirely useless hitherto I have been able with the Assistance of the Civil Magistrates to preserve this People in due Obedience but from Appearances I shall not be able to continue them much longer without the Assistance of some Troops & Officers who will pay due Obedience to my Orders .

		And the
Navy & Army	ORGANIZATION	will be Defeated , & disappointed of their expectations of receiving any more Supplies from this Province , which at best will be very inadequate to their wants .

Mercurii	LOCATION	, 9 Ho .

		A.M. , August 16th , 1775 Whereas , agreeable to a resolution of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the Mayor and magistrates of this city have been requested to procure a barge to be built for His Majesty 's ship
Asia	LOCATION	, to replace the one lately destroyed ; and this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	being informed that the carpenters in this city decline undertaking to build the said barge ; being apprehensive , by threats given out by some persons , if they should undertake to build the said barge , that the same may not only be destroyed , but that their persons or property may be injured or insulted .

		Resolved , That all persons who have given such obstruction by threats , to the execution of the aforesaid order , or shall hereafter , by threats or violence oppose the same , ought to be considered as factious , disorderly members of the community , and as guilty of a dangerous attempt to destroy the authority of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and to render them contemptible .

		Resolved , That for the purpose of effectually carrying into execution the said order , and to defeat the malicious designs of such as dare to condemn or oppose the authority and orders of this
House	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Henry Sheaf	PERSON	be ordered immediately to set about building a proper barge for the said ship
Asia	LOCATION	, and to finish her with all possible dispatch .

		And that Colonel -LSB-
John -RSB- Lasher	PERSON	be ordered to furnish a sufficient guard , who are to be relieved at the discretion of the colonel , to protect the said barge while building , and to see her safely delivered for the use of the said ship .

		And the magistrates as well as the other inhabitants of this city , are requested to give all necessary aid in this business ; that it may be known whether a few rash and restless individuals out of doors , or the representative body of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	in this Congress are to direct the measures for our publick safety at this dangerous and critical juncture .

		Resolved , That if any person or persons shall be found threatening or attempting to destroy the said barge , they be taken into custody by the said guard , and detained 'till the order of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	shall be made respecting them .

		Last week several slaves , the property of gentlemen in this town and neighbourhood , were discharged from on board the Otter , where it is now shamefully notorious , many of them for weeks past have been concealed , and their owners in some instances ill-treated for making application for them .

		The public , it is generally thought , is indebted for this discharge to a higher power than any on board that vessel .

		The officers that lately arrived in a vessel from
Boston	LOCATION	still continue at
Gosport	LOCATION	.

		Two of them , as we hear , are captains , one a lieutenant , three of them ensigns and one a surgeon .

		Some of them expressed great surprise , when in answer to their enquiries , they were told there were no men raised here , as it seems they had been made to expect that government , as it is called , could raise troops here at will .

Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	17 August 1775 I have received your Letter August 4 by Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	, who returns in the Spinckes with your Provisions .

		I would much rather have you cruize than lie at Anchor constantly , and purpose relieiving you , but the want of a Sloop to be at
Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	has hitherto prevented it , and I am apprehensive that if the
Harbour	LOCATION	is left without a Kings Ship they will in her absence , though but for a Week , mount Cannon and hinder any Ships entering in future , which must be guarded against .

		I have only one more .

		objection to your cruizing , and that is the situation of the Governor , who , by the
Harbour	LOCATION	being left without a Man of War , may consider himself exposed to the Resentment or evil design of the Rebels and to be left destitute of Protection .

		If these can be obviated I will order you to cruize immediately , but I will certainly send the first Sloop I have to relieve you .

		Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	has paid my share of the Freight of 1000 Dollars .

		I observe what you say about
Newbury	LOCATION	; that place and all others indeed require to be strictly attended to , but where are the Ships ?

		VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	, SECRETARY OF THE BRITISH
ADMIRALTY	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir
Preston Boston	PERSON	17 August 1775 In my last Letter July 29 by Col.
James	PERSON	I acquainted you that the
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	was ordered to convoy the
Russia Merchant Transport	ORGANIZATION	twenty Leagues to the Eastward of Cape Cod ; Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Linzee	PERSON	accordingly sailed the 30th with Directions to cruize between
Cape Ann	LOCATION	and the Isle of Shoals to intercept Supplies of Ammunition and Provisions coming to the Rebels .

		On the 10th .

		instant the
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	anchored at
Nantasket	LOCATION	, and I received a Letter from Captain
Linzee	PERSON	, -LRB- a Copy of which is inclosed -RRB- giving an Account of an unsuccessful attempt to take a large Schooner in
Cape Ann Harbour	LOCATION	and to destroy the Town , and that he was obliged to come away with the Loss of two Boats , his master Gunner , Sixteen Seamen and seven Marines taken Prisoners , and his Lieutenant wounded .

		It is so difficult to procure British Seamen that the Loss becomes considerable .

		At present they can not be replaced with Europeans and experience shews Americans are not to be trusted .

		In a former Letter I mentioned the Rebels having burnt the Wooden part of
Boston Light house	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Governor ordered it be repaired immediately ; Materials and Artificers were accordingly sent down , and at his request I ordered Lieut.
Coulthurst	PERSON	and a Party of Marines from the
Preston	PERSON	and
Boyne	LOCATION	for their Guard .

		The
Preston	PERSON	's Long Boat also staid with them , and Captain -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Bishop	PERSON	of the Lively at
Nantasket	LOCATION	had directions to give them all the assistance in his power , and to settle Signals to be made in case of danger .

		They had exceeded a week on this Duty and were to have been relieved on the 31st when to my great astonishment , I was informed they had been all cut off just after Day Light .

		The inclosed Account from the Midshipman who commanded the Long Boat will shew more particularly how this Affair happened .

		As the Light house
Island	LOCATION	with 30 men was judged capable of being defended against 1000 , it was extremely unfortunate the
Party of Marines	ORGANIZATION	made so little resistance , for in less than half an hour a great Reinforcement arrived : but I am sorry to say it appears to me the
Party	ORGANIZATION	were intent only upon escaping , although the Marine Officer was at the Reduction of
Belle Isle	LOCATION	and accounted a brave and experienced Officer .

		Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Robinson	PERSON	of the
Preston	PERSON	happened the night of the 30th .

		to have the
Boats of the Squadron	ORGANIZATION	endeavouring to get at and destroy some Whale Boats , secreted in a Wood near the Water Side ; this Scheme failed , but he arrived time enough to chase the Whale Boats across the
Lighthouse Channel	ORGANIZATION	to
Hull Beach	LOCATION	, from whence he brought away two of them and Lieut. Colthursts Body .

		Seven Artificers having got away from the Rebels , after being landed on the Main were brought off in one of the Boats , with Captain
Robinson	PERSON	; Two more escaped in the Long Boat .

		But two wounded Marines out of the whole Party were not taken , one of whom is since dead of his Wounds .

		The
Merlin	PERSON	anchored the 2d instant in the
Lighthouse Channel	ORGANIZATION	from a Cruize On the 5th .

		his
Majestys Ship Fowey	LOCATION	arrived from
Virginia	LOCATION	and brought fifty two men for the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, many of them very indifferent .

		I ordered Captain
-LSB- George -RSB- Montagu	PERSON	to place his Ship between
Charles Town	PERSON	and
Boston	LOCATION	, but I shall send her to
Halifax	LOCATION	as soon as I can put another in her place .

		On the 6th .

		his Majesty 's
Sloop Kingsfisher	PERSON	arrived with a Vessel having on board 20 head of Cattle seized in the Sound on the restraining Act .

		They have been since condemned in the
Admiralty Court	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	.

		By Captain
George Montagu	PERSON	I received a Letter from Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	Governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	-LRB- a Copy of which and of my Answer is inclosed -RRB- exhibiting complaints of a very serious nature against Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Macartney	PERSON	of his Majesty 's Ship Mercury and referring me to Captain
Montagu	PERSON	for Particulars .

		I inclose also Captain
Montagu	PERSON	's upon my requiring him to inform me of such Facts relative to Captain Macartneys Misconduct as had come to his knowledge .

		Conceiving it therefore unsafe to the Command of his Majesty 's Ship any longer with Captain
Macartney	PERSON	I ordered the Kingsfisher to
Virginia	LOCATION	, and have sent Lieut.
-LSB- Alexander -RSB- Graeme	PERSON	in her with Directions to put Captain
Macartney	PERSON	in Arrest , and to bring the Mercury forthwith to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The Kingsfisher accordingly sailed from hence the 14th instant .

		A Tender belonging to the Rose came in the 6th instant , and I received from Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	a Parcel of Rebel Letters taken from two Men who came lately from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and were going in a Boat to
Providence	LOCATION	.

		transmit Copies of three of them , the rest are chiefly written on domestick & trading subjects .

		The
Merlin	PERSON	sailed the 8th with a
Transport	ORGANIZATION	carrying a part of the poor of
Boston	LOCATION	, and returned again the 16th with the Transport having landed them at
Marblehead	LOCATION	.

		The
Canceaux	PERSON	arrived from
Halifax	LOCATION	the 9th and sailed again the 17th .

		with the Spinckes Tender laden with provisions for the
Scarborough	PERSON	at
Piscatagua	LOCATION	.

		On the 11th I determined to send the
Somerset	LOCATION	to
Halifax	LOCATION	to stop her Leaks , and accordingly have given Captain
-LSB- Edward	PERSON	-RSB- LeCras Orders to that purpose , and respecting the Security of the Yard and Stores while he remains there , and to return as soon as possible to
Boston	LOCATION	; but not to leave
Halifax	LOCATION	unless a 20 Gun Ship at least is in the
Harbour	LOCATION	.

		He now waits only for a Wind to put to Sea directly .

		The Governor expressing his Uneasiness for the Safety of a Number of Transports sent to
Gardiners	LOCATION	and
Fishers Islands for Cattle	ORGANIZATION	and other live Stock , I sent Captain -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Bishop	PERSON	in the Lively to cruize for them from
Cape Cod	LOCATION	to the Isle of Shoals .

		He returned the 15th with the whole Convoy , which has brought the Garrison a very good supply of Cattle and Sheep .

		On the 11th instant I received a Letter from Lieut. -LSB-
John -RSB- Knight	PERSON	, late Commander of his Majesty 's Schooner Diligent , but now a prisoner at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		I inclose a Copy of his Letter , to which I can only say that Mr
Knight	PERSON	must have been totally unacquainted with the disposition of the people at
Mechias	LOCATION	, and the fate of the
Margeuritta	LOCATION	, and apprehending no danger , had put in there as usual ; but as I know of no good Service that could call him to
Mechias	PERSON	, until his release and an enquiry is made into his Conduct , no true Judgement can be formed .

		In the mean time the Rebels having possession of the Diligent not only deprives the Squadron of her assistance , but will I fear for some time hinder the publication of such of Mr Des Barres Draughts as wait only for the Soundings .

		I have appointed the Honorable Mr -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB- Tollemache to be Captain of the Scorpion by
Commission	ORGANIZATION	dated 29th July , and Mr
James Drew of the Preston Lieutenant	PERSON	in his room .

		This Sloop is nearly ready for Sea and I intend to send her to relieve the Cruizer at

New York	LOCATION	, August 17 .

		The following is the best account we are able to ccllect , of the late Expedition of the Piratical Regular Traitors to the English Constitution , and the British Colonies , in plundering ,
Fisher	PERSON	's
Gardner	PERSON	's , Plum and
Block Islands	LOCATION	, of Stock Provision , & c. The Design of the Regulars , to plunder these islands , having been communicated to the Inhabitants and Proprietors by the
Congress of New York	ORGANIZATION	, and other Intelligences , as early as Tuesday the 8th , there was Time to have taken off all the Stock ; and some was actually taken off : But some Differences having arisen between the Proprietors and the Committees , concerning the Expence of the Business , before any Thing could be determined , the Ships of the Enemy appeared in Sight ー Dispatches were immediately sent to alarm and assemble the People on the
Connecticut	LOCATION	and
Long-Island Shores	LOCATION	, who , notwithstanding the utmost haste they could then make , were too late to prevent the Execution of the Fellonious Design of the Enemy ; who on Friday the 11th , approached
Gardner	PERSON	's
Island	LOCATION	, with the following Vessels and Forces , viz. 7 Transport Ships , 2 Brigs , 2 Men of War , 1 Snow of 10 Guns , 1 Armed Schooner of 17 Men and 200 Regulars , as reported by the Sailors , landed on the Island and assisted by 10 villanous Tories from
South Hold	LOCATION	, & c. took off the following Stock , & c. By the account of
Benjamin Millar	PERSON	, the Overseer , 1000 Sheep 30 Hogs 13 Geese , 3 Calves , 1000 1b .

		Cheese 7 Tons Hay were taken off , and much Damage done to
Gardens	LOCATION	, Fences , Fowls , & c .

		When they went away , they left on the Table Half a
Guinea	LOCATION	and a Pistareen .

		Signed by
Benjamin Miller	PERSON	.

		And attested .

		The following Letter was left by the Commanding Officer , and gives Reason to suspect that the Expedition -LRB- as to
Gardiner	PERSON	's Island -RRB- was preconcerted with the Proprietor , or Manager .

		ー The following is an exact Copy , viz. `` Sir : As we have got loaded all the Vessels , I ca n't come to your
House	ORGANIZATION	, according to Promise , I send you Account of what I have got off your Island ; Sheep , 823 ;
Fat Cattle	ORGANIZATION	, 59 ; Cows , 3 ; Calves , 3 ; one of the Calves got away ; The Cheese I will take Account of .

		ー Send me some Pigs , Fowls and Potatoes , and
Ducks	ORGANIZATION	, and some Bread ; and when you come to
Boston	LOCATION	, I will secure your Interest to you if in my power .

		I am very sorry it is not in my Power to come , to your
House	ORGANIZATION	, but so good a Wind we ca n't stay ; the Hay you must send an Account of by Capt.
Lawrence	PERSON	.

		Sir , I am your 's ,
Abijah Willant	PERSON	Aug. 11th , 1775 , 12 o'clock at Night . ''

		Besides the fore mentioned Stock from
Gardiner 's Island	LOCATION	, we are informed that the same Crew of Free Booters , took from
Fisher 's Island 26 Fat Cattle	ORGANIZATION	; and about 1000 Sheep ; also from
Plumb Island	LOCATION	, 14 Fat Cattle : At this last Island they had only one Prize Wood Boat and a Transport Brig. On their arrival and landing on one Side of the Island , they were fired upon by about 100 of Col. -LSB-
David -RSB- Wooster	PERSON	's Provincials , who had landed on the other Side .

		But it being represented to the Commanding Officer , that the
Island	LOCATION	was nearly surrounded by a Number of the Enemy 's armed Vessels who would be likely to cut off their Retreat , they fired but one Volley , which did not appear to have done any Execution , and then retired to the main Land , when the 14 Cattle were taken off .

		After these Exploits , 3 more Transports appearing in Sight , on Tuesday Morning -LSB- August 8 -RSB- the
Rose	PERSON	and the Swan , Sloops of War , sailed to meet them , in order to make a Descent upon , and Plunder Block Island ; the Success of which Attempt we have not yet heard .

		It is the Opinion of good Judges , that only 200
Provincial Soldiers	ORGANIZATION	well posted on either of these
Islands	LOCATION	, would have repelled the Attack made upon it by the Regulars .

		The Officers we have enlarged upon their written Parole , to render themselves at your Camp ; and two Soldiers taken with them , being their Servants , on the Parole of Major -LSB-
Christopher	PERSON	-RSB- French the Principal Officer , Copies of which Paroles are enclosed .

		The Major requested when he signed the Parole that we would for his Justification give him a Certificate of his making a Claim in behalf of himself & the others , and that his Claim was not admitted .

		We gratified him in this , and a Copy of our Certificate is Also enclosed .

		They were allowed to take with them their own Baggage , but the Baggage of some other Officers now in
Boston	LOCATION	, which he also requested , was refused , on account of the detention of the Effects of our Friends there by General -LSB-

DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 NO. 22 -LSB-
Bermuda	LOCATION	-RSB- August the 17 ー 1775 My Lord In the night of the 14th .

		Instant August , when almost a Sufficient Number of Members of Assembly to make an
House	ORGANIZATION	were come to Town Agreeable to Adjournment , I had less Suspicion than before , that such a daring and violent Attempt would be made on the
Powder Magazine	ORGANIZATION	.

		which in the dead of the night of the 14th of
Aupst	LOCATION	was broke into on Top , just to let a man down , and the Doors most Audaciously and daringly forced open , at the great risk of their being blown up ; they could not force the
Powder Room Door	LOCATION	, without getting into the inside on Top They Stole and Carried off about one Hundred Barrels of Gun powder , and as they left about ten or twelve Barrels , it may be Supposed that those Barrels left , would not bare remooving .

		It must have taken a Considerable number of People ; and we may Suppose some Negroes , to assist as well as White Persons of consequence On Wednesday the 16 Instant -LRB- of August , -RRB- the Legislative Body , Voted one Hundred pounds Sterling Reward , to any Person or Persons , that shall make any discovery , and legally convict any of the perpetrators of this Audacious peice of
Villany	LOCATION	.

		And I have offered His Majesteys most gracious pardon to any One Person , that shall make any Discovery of any Person or Persons so that they be legally Convicted of this most heinous Crime , and a further Reward of thirty pounds out of my own purse , All which was immediately offered by Proclamation .

		And likewise thirty Dollars , or ten pounds Currency , I have offered to be paid to any Negro , or Negroes , to inform against any other Negro or Negroes , that were aiding and assisting so that they be legally Convicted .

		The next morning the 15th Instant , -LRB- of August -RRB- one Sloop Called the Lady
Catharine	PERSON	, belonging by Her Register to
Virginia	LOCATION	,
George Ord Master	PERSON	, bound to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, was seen under Sail , but the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	Boat could not over take Her .

		And likewise a Skooner Called the
Charles Town	PERSON	and
Savannah Packet	LOCATION	, belonging to
South Carolina	LOCATION	, from
South Carolina	LOCATION	Cleared out at
Bermuda	LOCATION	the 11th of August with 2,000 Sawed Stones for
Barbados John Turner Master	ORGANIZATION	.

		And was seen under Sail the same day , at such a Distance off , that the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	Boat could not over take either of the Vessels .

		It may be supposed that neither of the vessels came near the Shore , to take in the Powder , if they did carry it away , but it is rather to be imagined that it must have .

		been Carried out by Several Boats , as both these Vessels , Sailed from a
Harbour	LOCATION	at the
West End	LOCATION	, twenty Miles off , of the Magazine .

Antigua	LOCATION	your Letter of the 14th Inst dated from on board the
Portland	LOCATION	at English Harbour .

		The
Council	ORGANIZATION	gives full Credit to the information made to you of the No Americans offering at the Dutch , Danish & French Islands in these Seas unlimitted prices for
Ammunition & Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	& they do not doubt but many of the No Americans who Trade to the
Island	LOCATION	would purchase powder & c for the Service of their Countrymen if such
Stores	ORGANIZATION	were to be got at The
Council	ORGANIZATION	have no intimation of the
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	supposed to be in great quantities in the possession of private Adventurers & flatter themselves that this peice of information is without foundation ; they will use their best endeavours to investigate the truth , & will with all their powers discourage a Trade dishonorable in itself & ruinous to the Community they however beg leave to inform you that they have no authority to prevent the buying & selling of Merchandize which hath been fairly imported & would advise an Application to the Commander in Chief of these
Islands	LOCATION	for a proclamation to restrain the selling of Powder & other War-like Stores to the No American Traders I am & c Tho s

FRANCIS LEGGE	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF NOVA SCOTIA , TO GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	1 -LRB- COPY -RRB-
Halifax	LOCATION	August 18th 1775 .

		Sir I have by this Conveyance sent you the result of his Majesty 's Council upon the present Circumstances of the Colony upon a Supposed intended Invasion ; the Americans may project an Invasion for several purposes , to deprive the Armies from any supplies from hence , to possess themselves of the
Militiary Stores	ORGANIZATION	here , among which are near 300 pieces of Cannon , Serviceable & unserviceable , but perhaps principally to destroy his Majesty 's
Naval Yard	LOCATION	.

		I am of Opinion that at present the most effectual method of securing the
Military Small Stores	ORGANIZATION	, with the Powder , will be to put them on Board some Small Vessels to lay under the protection of the Tartar , till Transports can be sent & employed for that purpose , & shall accordingly put it in practice .

		I am also of a Opinion that some place of defence should be made by Block Houses ,
& Picketts	ORGANIZATION	for the securing the Cannon , & that the
Citadel Hill	LOCATION	would be the most proper Place for such defence which I apprehend may be done at no great expence .

		That this precaution if put into Execution would not only defeat the purposes & designs of the Rebells , but upon their receiving Advice of such works being erected , it would even prevent their Attempting it .

		I am Obliged at this time to desire of your Excellency that the Troops here may be exchanged for others who may be Obedient to such Orders as it will be necessary for me to give , for the defence & Protection of this Province , more especially as I have great reason to believe that the militia here is not to be Depended upon , & we have many of them inimical to the measures of Government & perhaps might be rather aiding to destroy than preserve the Stores & Magazines here .

		Captain
-LSB- Edward -RSB- Meadows	PERSON	is so apprehensive of the insecurity of the Yard that he had Signified to the Council his readiness to go into the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, yet upon some more weighty Consideration is of Opinion that his Ships Stay here at present is immediately Necessary for its protection .

		HIS MAJESTY 'S OFFICERS FOR THE ANNAPOLIS DISTRICT TO
ROBERT EDEN	LOCATION	, GOVERNOR OF
MARYLAND	ORGANIZATION	1 Sir
Annapolis	PERSON	18th .

		Aug 1775 In answer to the Letter Your Excellency was pleased to write to Us the 12th Instant , respecting the Ship Totness Capt.
Warren	PERSON	, which was lately destroyed about Twelve Miles below this Place .

		We can only report to your Excellency , from hearsay , that the Vessel being bound from
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	to
Baltimore	LOCATION	with a Cargo of Salt and other Articles on Board , run on Shore in the Night of the 9th or loth of last Month on a Shoal , near some
Islands	LOCATION	called the three Sisters , where She lay several Days without the Master taking any Measures to get off by lightening Her .

		The second or third Day after she had remained in such Situation , some Gentlemen , who had been chosen by the Inhabitants of that part of the Province to see that the
Association	ORGANIZATION	relative to the Non-Importation of Goods from
Great Britain	LOCATION	should be strictly observed , went on
Board	ORGANIZATION	, asked the Master some Questions about his Cargo , & Destination of his Vessel ; & being assured by him that it was not his Intention to land any of his Cargo there ー They did not interfere further but consented to his proceeding to
Baltimore	LOCATION	if He should think fit to do SO .

		The ship continuing aground some Days afterwards , & no Steps being taken by the Master to get her off , many People at different times went on Board , & a Report was spread that there were many other Goods than the Master had acknowledged to the Committee , & that He was not sollicitous to get his Vessel off or to proceed to any other Place .

		It likewise became a Subject of Conversation that this was the Third Ship which Mr
Gildart	PERSON	of
Liverpoole	LOCATION	had sent thence , loaded to this Province , after He had been apprized of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	, & that some Persons from
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	had declared he avowed a Resolution to pay no Regard to it .

		Such Discourses having made an Impression on a Number of young People who live in the Neighbourhood , They went on Board , and after advising the Master & Crew , to take out such things as were their own private Property set Her on Fire ; but we have not yet been able to learn certainly who the Persons were that committed such Outrage , nor did the Master or any of the Crew come to , or pass thro this Place , so as to give either of Us an Opportunity of asking them any Questions .

		Had not the Vessel been unluckily run ashore , the Master wd probably have been ordered back from
Baltimore	LOCATION	, without landing the Cargo ; but we do not think any Attempt would have been made either there or in this Place to destroy Her , unless
Goods	ORGANIZATION	had been landed ; in which Case she would not , We apprehend , have been in safety any where in this or either of the Neighbouring Provinces .

FRANCIS LEGGE	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF NOVA SCOTIA , TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Halifax August 19th 1775 .

		My Lord As the affairs in
America	LOCATION	are become more & more interesting , I thought it my indispensable Duty to inform your Lordship of the Critical Situation this Colony is in at present the Troops in
Boston	LOCATION	are confined to very narrow limits being now surrounded by the Rebels with an Army Consisting by the last Accounts of 19,750 men , Intrenched & Can not be attacked without Sustaining such losses as at present would be unbearable .

		The last Attack at
Charlestown	LOCATION	tho ' a Victory was gained it was purchased with the loss of a Thousand of the best Troops killed & wounded ; & such another Victory would put it out of the Power of the Kings Troops to act but on the defensive part ; their cutting off all communication with the Country leaves the Troops destitute of having any supplies but from the Province of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	who do not abound , but a Quantity has been sent , and more ready to Sail but have been prevented from Vessels fitted out in the Eastern Coasts of
New England Cruizing	LOCATION	in the
Bay	LOCATION	.

		It seems the Supply of Provision for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	from
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	has enraged the Americans throughout & they have marked us out as objects of their Resentment .

		I am well informed by Captain
-LSB- William -RSB- Doddingston	PERSON	of the
Senegal	LOCATION	, who was at
Penobscott	LOCATION	with four Transports taking in Wood for the Supply of the Troops , & from whence he was obliged to remove to this place to compleat their loading , that there were four Armed Vessels but they kept in Shoal Waters out of his reach he was informed by one of the Inhabitants that they had 700 Men Armed and prepared in that
Bay	LOCATION	, & that 900 men were Assembled at
Casco Bay	LOCATION	under Colonel -LSB-
Jedediah -RSB- Prebble	PERSON	, and by advices since my last from
Machias	LOCATION	it appears without doubt that they are meditating an Attempt against this Province .

		I can not but observe to your Lordship , the great importance I conceive the preserving this Province will be to his Majesty 's Interests in
America	LOCATION	, the only
Port	LOCATION	where Ships can be cleaned & have a Supply of Masts & other Timber ; all other resource in
America	LOCATION	being entirely at an end , & where the Troops can retreat should that happen to be the case , but is at present the only place from whence they can be supplied with any kind of refreshments for which the
Army	ORGANIZATION	at present suffer greatly for want of the Vessels which have been loaded these three weeks & dare not depart .

		Upon all these Considerations my Lord , I think it absolutely Necessary that Fortifications for the Security of the
Naval Yard	LOCATION	, the protection of the Magazine in the Town Cannon & other Military Stores shou 'd be erected for I conceive that the Magazines when thus protected will be the only safe place in
America	LOCATION	for their Deposit .

		I must inform your Lordship that there is not the least kind of defence about the Town , we lay open to the Country on every side , that the Batteries are dismantled the Carriages of the Guns all decayed & they lying on the Ground .

Marblehead	LOCATION	,
Augst	PERSON	19th 1775 In answer to yours of the 17th instant , which we receive very kindly , as an Instance of your friendship .

		we are sensible of the Justness of your remark , that at this distressing time in a special manner , nothing can be of more Importance for the general good of the Country , than the Union of the whole ; & that the prosperity and happiness of every Town , is dependant very much , upon the peace & good order subsisting among them ; so also , the friendly Intercourse with our Neighbours , is of publick Utility .

		We therefore would with great Regret , Inform you , that we are Sorry , any of our Members have given you , or the publick in general , any cause of Jealousy or Complai -LSB- nt -RSB- this we are satisfied , has proceeded from an Error in Judgment , and not from any design inimical to the publick good .

Interest of America	ORGANIZATION	, manifested himself , to be a real Friend to his Country ; and we still Esteem him to be such : ー The Commanders of the Troops stationed here , received no special Orders from General
Washington	LOCATION	, but since the affair above , our
Committee of Correspondence	ORGANIZATION	have directed such watches , as they apprehend , will prevent any cause of complaint from our Friends , as to any Concern wth any Man of War that may for the future come into our Harbour .

Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	19 August 1775 By the Transport lately arrived with Cattle and Sheep Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	informs me that
Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	being sent to him of the Rebels taking the Stock off the
Islands	LOCATION	he weighed with the Swan from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	in the Afternoon of the 5th instant and then run them to Fishers Island the same night , where the Rebels had taken away fifteen head of
Cattle	ORGANIZATION	; however the Transports got a supply there .

		The next day he convoyed them to
Gardiners Island	LOCATION	and having cleared the Coast of every Interruption and left the Transports in quiet possession , he returned to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, from whence the Service does not admit of his being long absent : he acquaints me the
Glasgow	LOCATION	had not yet joined him .

		His Majesty 's Sloop
Senegal	LOCATION	arrived at
Halifax	LOCATION	the 4th instant with the Transports under her Convoy sent to get Fuel in
Penobscot Bay	LOCATION	.

		By a Letter from Captain -LSB-
William -RSB- Dudingstone	PERSON	dated the 7th instant I find that he continued peaceably at
Long Island	LOCATION	from the 16th to the 25th of last Month , when he was informed a Colonel -LSB-
James -RSB- Cargill	PERSON	with 7 or 8 hundred men , assisted with three large Sloops also full of men were preparing to attack the Transports and prevent their having any more Wood .

		The Sloops Captain
Dudingstone	PERSON	says he saw with Flags at their Mast Heads and chased them .

		Capt.
Dudingstone	PERSON	also writes that Mr
Winslow	PERSON	, who was charged with the Business of procuring
Wood	PERSON	, assured him the Sloops he had chased had already destroyed
Penobscot Fort	LOCATION	, and that as the Country people were disposed , it would be impossible for the Transports to complete their Lading there , or in any other part of
New England	LOCATION	, and proposed going to
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Dudingstone	PERSON	consented as the most likely method to succeed .

		They accordingly proceeded to
Halifax	LOCATION	, and I find will get as much Wd as they can take on board .

		I inclose a Copy of an Affidavit sent me by Governor
-LSB- Francis -RSB- Legge	PERSON	, which I do purposely to assure you that only what relates to his Majesty 's Schooner Diligent , and the Philadelphian Sloop , is true .

		It is even suspected that the Philadelphian was intended for Mechias and not for
Halifax	LOCATION	, and the Story of her being taken , like many other false Reports , is calculated to serve a particular purpose .

		The ostensible Reason given by the Rebels for an Expedition to
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	is to prevent our having Supplies of fresh provisions , but there is no doubt that their principal Object is the destruction of the King 's Stores at
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		I shall endeavour to defeat their Designs by keeping a good force on the Coast and in the
Harbour	LOCATION	, and to render the Navigation between it and
Boston	LOCATION	perfectly secure .

		I inclose a Copy of a Letter from Governor
Legge	PERSON	for your further information on this Subject .

		In the King 's Yard an Officer 's Guard of Marines is constantly on Duty with three Watchmen at Night well equipped , beside a Patrole from eight in the Evening until four in the Morning : And every other precaution is taken to prevent Losses by Fire or Thieves .

		The Naval Officer acquaints me he has not been able to trace whether the last fire was occasioned through accident or design , but is inclined to think from Accident , as there has been formerly some Pilferings from the Paint Pots ; and that finding he can get privately no satisfactory Information he intends to advertize and offer a large Reward for the discovery of the perpetrators .

		The Halifax Schooner is by this time ready and sails for
Boston	LOCATION	immediately .

		The Hinchinbrook is also in great forwardness .

		The Store Ship is not yet arrived but much wanted .


Eighteen Sail of Transport	ORGANIZATION	under Convoy of the Merlin and
Falcon	ORGANIZATION	are going for forage and Cattle to
Annapolis	LOCATION	,
Windsor	LOCATION	and

		They will sail the beginning of next Week , and there will then remain in this Harbour the
Preston	LOCATION	,
Boyne	LOCATION	, Lively and
Fowey	PERSON	with the
Bolton Brig	ORGANIZATION	who will be fit for Sea in a Fortnight .

		Our sole reliance for Stores and provisions is likely to be on what comes from

		I hope a further Supply is ordered and that the Transports will arrive before the end of December .

		We have no Accounts from
England	LOCATION	later than the 8th June , but are every hour expecting the arrival of some of his Majesty 's Ships .

Europe	LOCATION	, which , is unloaded here , and the Owners get a Reasonable price for it in bills on the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, we shall therefore be in no want of that necessary Article , and two days ago the two Ships sent wth -LSB- Colonel

Gamble	ORGANIZATION	has wrote
Sherrieff	PERSON	a long letter out of which I have taken the Inclosed Paragraph , by which you may form some Judgement as to the disposition of the Canadians , but as I have Extracted this Paragraph without anybodys knowledge , I beg you will keep the intelligence therein to yr Self , or at least not let it be known from whence it comes to you , I also send you under the same Confidence Copys of Letters that pass 'd a few days ago between

		On Tuesday night last -LSB- August 15 -RSB- the
Rebells	PERSON	threw up a Battery with 4
Ambrasurs	ORGANIZATION	on the hill to the right of the burying ground at
Roxbury	LOCATION	, and next Morning fired two shots from One Gun Into our lines , which we returned , but it did not seem to disconcert them much as they Continued to Work hard to Compleat it , which they have Effected .

		On Thursday Morning we discovered another Battery of 6 Ambrasers in the Orchard to the left of
Roxbury	LOCATION	Just behind where the George tavern Stood , and a line drawn aCrose the Road between the two Batterys , it seems to be rather a defencive that Offencive Work , and our Artillery say they can soon dismount their Guns by a superior fire shou 'd they begin to

		General How -LSB- e -RSB- has fortified the hill at
Charlestown	LOCATION	in such a Manner as will prevent their daring to insult him , and we are dayly Strengthing the lines , and Wharfs opposite to

		We are drolly Situated totally neglected by all the rest of the
World	ORGANIZATION	.

		About ten days ago Mr -LSB-
Benjamin -RSB- Hallawell	PERSON	the Commissioner and the Admiral had a Skuffle , opposite Mr
Brantones	PERSON	house .

		It seems Mr
Hallawell	PERSON	had wrote a letter some time ago , relative to some Hay the Admiral had taken from Mr
Hallawells	PERSON	farm , on one of the
Islands	LOCATION	.

		wch letter the Admiral did not Answer being -LRB- as he the Admiral says -RRB- wrote in disrespectful stile , when
Mr Hallawell	PERSON	met him he asked him , the reason he had not Answered his letter , the Admiral replyed he did not Chuse it , as it was wrote in an Improper stile , the other said he was a Gentleman and intitled to an Answer and by God he wou 'd be treated as such , the Admiral said again , he wou 'd never Answer that letter upon which
Hallawell	PERSON	came close up to him & told him he was a damed Rascall , upon which the Admiral gave him a back handed Stroke in the face , that knocked him down , and then steped back and drew his Sword half out , but on perseiving that
Hallawell	PERSON	was not Armed , he put it up .


Hallawell	PERSON	then closed with him , struck the Admiral and in the Scuffle drew the Admirals Sword and snaped it in two peices , upon this
Dunkin	PERSON	and some other people that were near rushed in , and Separated them .

		thus ended this bloody -LSB- Unfinished -RSB- 1 .

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM BOSTON , AUG. 19 -LSB- 1775 -RSB- '' 1 Since my last we have had every day more or less firing on the
Charlestown	LOCATION	side , but without much damage on either part .

		We have been very quiet all night , and have had little disturbance through the day , till last Friday , when the following battle royal in the streets drew all our attention , and has since engrossed all our conversation .

		ー Mr.
-LSB- Benjamin -RSB- Hallowell	PERSON	, a Commissioner of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	, had written four letters to Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Greaves	PERSON	.

		The subject of these letters was , it is said , an expostulation with the Admiral for taking forcibly , for his own use , one half of a quantity of hay , purchased by the Commission on some of the islands , for allowing the other half to pass .

		The Commissioner meeting the Admiral in Milk-street , who had never thought proper to answer any of his letters , stopped and enquired , why that notice had not been taken of his letters , which he , as a Gentleman , had a right to expect ?

		To this civil question , the Admiral replied in his usual style ; and while the Commissioner was whispering a challenge to him , returned a blow in the face .

		Though Mr.
Hallowell	PERSON	was unarmed , the Admiral had recourse to his sword , on which the former rushed upon him , forced it from him , broke it over his knee , and then flung it in
Greaves	PERSON	's face ; after this they went to it with their fists , but were soon parted .

		ー The Admiral has come off with a black eye .

		He has not yet proposed a renewal of battle , probably preserving himself for the
Yankies	PERSON	, who have already carried off all his fresh stock , burnt his hay on the islands , and destroyed the light-house twice under his very nose .

		One of his relations , w , ho expects the first vacant ship , challenged the Commissioner , who replied , he knew no such person as the challenger , but should always defend himself whenever he should be attacked .

		-- In his own department , the Admiral is more hated and despised , if possible , than he is by the army and the rebels .

		Capt. M -- is waiting to accompany him to
England	LOCATION	, whenever he shall be recalled ; and if the Admiral can rally his spirits , their interview will not end with a boxing match .

WILLIAM CAMPBELL	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF

DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 No 5
Charles Town	PERSON	19th August 1775 My Lord , My Letters No 2 , 3 , & 4 , with a Duplicate of No 1 , which was sent by the Scorpion , -LRB- Via
Boston	LOCATION	, -RRB- will I hope reach your Lordship in Safety .

		I sent them by the Sandwich Packet Boat which sailed from here the 6th Instant under Convoy of the
Tamar	PERSON	.

		The Man of War saw her 17 Leagues to Sea , & returned here Wedny the 9th ー We are now in such a situation I can not attempt to send duplicates of my last letters , as I must be under the necessity of letting the Mail take its chance in a defenceless Packet Boat , for I can not in our present State send the poor solitary worm eaten Sloop we have got here , out of the
Harbour	LOCATION	, as I may now expect the next packet every day , & am still in hopes of hearing from Genl -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	& the Admiral soon.ー Your Lordship will I am afraid imagine I dwell too much , & too warmly on the wretched state we are left in here , but my Zeal for the King 's Service my thorough Conviction of the ill consequences that has attended the total neglect of this Province , as well as
Georgia , & N. Carolina	ORGANIZATION	, will not suffer me to remain Silent .

		Since my arrival here , I have seen
Georgia	LOCATION	a Province at present , of the last consequence to the
W. India Islands	LOCATION	, warp 'd from its duty by a very insignificant internal faction , aided by the people in this Province .

		The friends of Government here have been so sunk , so abandon 'd to despair , for some time , that it is hardly possible to make them beleive the British Nation is determined to assert their just rights over the Colonies , & it is to very little purpose I mention the great force to the Northward , when it is not in my power to produce a single line from either of the Commanders in that part of
America	LOCATION	, to enable me to contradict the numberless falshoods which are every day propagated , & which does more mischief than I can express.ー This is a very disagreable Subject for me to dwell on , but my Duty requires I should represent the true State of this Province , & of my unfortunate
Vicinage of N. Carolina	ORGANIZATION	, &
Georgia	LOCATION	, which is equally neglected , equally abandon 'd .

		ー Your Lordship will I am sure excuse my warmth when I acquaint You , that Yesterday under colour of Law , they hanged , & burned , an unfortunate Wretch , a free Negroe of considerable property , one of the most valuable , & useful Men in his way , in the Province , on suspicion of instigating an Insurrection , for which I am convinced there was not the least ground .

		I could not save him My Lord !

		the very reflection Horrows My Soul !

		I have only the comfort to think I left no means untried to preserve him .

		They have now dipt their hands in Blood , God Almighty knows where it will end , but I am determined to remain till the last extremity in hopes to preserve the
King 's Service	ORGANIZATION	, ` tho My familys being here , adds not a little to my distress .

		Another Act of Barbarity , tho happily not of so tragical a Nature was committed a few days ago , on a poor man the Gunner of
Fort Johnson	PERSON	, who for expressing his Loyalty was tarr 'd , & feather 'd 10 or 12 times , in different parts of the Town , & otherwise treated with great cruelty , Stopping him at the doors of those Crown Officers who were most obnoxious ; & the Mob so grossly insulted Mr
Milligen	PERSON	in particular who is Surgeon to the Forts , & Garrisons in this Province that he was under a necessity of taking refuge on board the King 's Ship till the Packet Boat sails .

		I intend committing this Packet to the care of Mr
Milligen	PERSON	who I hope will have the honor of delivering it to Your Lordship .

		I beg leave to introduce him as a most honourable , worthy man , who has lived many Years in this Province beloved , & respected by all ranks , till his Zeal for the King 's Service in these unhappy times , made him obnoxious to the Mob .

		This Gentleman is perfectly acquainted with the State of the Province , & I can assure Your Lordship You may put entire confidence in his Honor & Veracity.ー I inclose with this a Letter I recd from
Coll	PERSON	:
Fletchal	PERSON	with my Answer : sorry am I to find myself unable to protect or assist the Kings Loyal Subjects here , it is a cruel mortification .

		I also send my Answer to an Address from a society of Quakers , in the back part of the Country ; they consist of about 300 familys , & are warmly attached to Government .

		Your Lordship will likewise receive a Copy of an Oath tender 'd to All those who refuse to sign the
Association	ORGANIZATION	, my own private Secretary not excepted , & a Message I sent to the Assembly some days ago , with their answer , all which will plainly convince Your Lordship on what ticklish Ground we stand here .

		The Armed Vessel that was fitted out from this Port has seized a quantity of powder part of it the property of His Majy on board a Ship lying off -LSB- St. -RSB-
Augustine Bar	LOCATION	in
E. Florida	LOCATION	, & carried it to
Beaufort	LOCATION	in this Province .

		Last Sunday 30 of the Militia of this Town were sent to convey it here , & I am told that by one means or other , they have amass 'd great quantities of warlike
Stores	ORGANIZATION	, Ammunition particularly , which they can easily do , as there is no force by Sea , or Land to prevent them , & they allow
Rice	PERSON	to be exported on no other terms , but paying in Arms & Ammunition .

		The new raised Troops which are quarter 'd in the Barracks may be near 800 consisting of Vagabonds & Thieves of all Countries , & the
Charles Town Militia	LOCATION	may be pretty near the same number .

		The Regt of Horse was to be raised in the back Country ; but I am told the levies there have been much check 'd by
Fletchal	PERSON	,
Robinson	PERSON	, & one
Cunningham	LOCATION	, memtion 'd by
Coll	PERSON	:
Fletchal	PERSON	in his letter , who is a very active Man , & remarkably spirited .

		Mr
Milligan	PERSON	will give Your Lordship a very particular account of these matters that have fallen within his knowledge , as he is Sensible & intelligent .

		As the fate of the Crown Officers is not determined by the Comme if Mr
Innis	PERSON	is forced from me , Which I will endeavour by all means to prevent , he has offer 'd at any risk , to endeavor an escape into the back Country , join
Coll Fletchal	PERSON	, in concert with Mr
Cameron	PERSON	the Dept Superintendant , but I will not now think of that Scheme .

		I have the Honor to be & c.
William Campbell	PERSON	N.B. I shall encourage the Kings faithful Subjects as much as is in my power .

		I can do no more .

		Some expence may be incurr 'd by my Orders to
Coll	PERSON	.


Fletchal	PERSON	, I have no power to do it , but I can not hesitate at such a juncture .

HENRY LAURENS	PERSON	, PRESIDENT OF THE

Beaufort	PERSON	19th of August 1775 Sir Yesterday I did myself the honor of writing to the President of the Council of Safety by Captain
-LSB- Clement	PERSON	-RSB- Lempriere who commanded the Schooner which has the Gun Powder on board , and in that Letter I would have been more full , had not the Wind and tide suited for Captain
Lempriere	PERSON	to sail immediately ; but soon after they got under Sail a thunder Squal came up the River by which means the tide was lost ; which has given me an opportunity of writing again by Captain
Lempriere	PERSON	, in my last I mentiond that I should keep a sufficient number of men in this Town , untill the Powder was safely out of this River , which would have been in a few hours , had not the
Squal	PERSON	happend ; as soon as the Vessels were under Sail I discharged a detachment from two Companies of
Prince William Parish	LOCATION	, where there are the fewest Whites in proportion to the Domestics , with orders to proceed to their own homes or districts ; but as soon as I found that Captain
Lempriere	PERSON	had lost the tide and could not proceed , I detain 'd a number of other Men so as to have one hundred & Sixty of my Regiment , which added to the detachment of Provincials under Captain Cattles -LSB- either
Benjamin	PERSON	or
William Cattell	PERSON	-RSB- command , with the detachment of Grenadiers and Artillery from
Charles Town	PERSON	amounting in all to two Hundred and fifty , a force which I thought would be sufficient for the intended Service ー these Men I shall detain untill the Vessell with the Powder is out of this River , which I expect will be by one O'clock , when I will discharge the Men until farther Ordersー In your favor of the 3rd Instt , you are pleased to say , that the Report of My being censured by the
Council of Safety	ORGANIZATION	, was groundless ー give me leave to say , I do think 't was sufficient to make any man of feeling uneasy , and I was not singular in my opinion , as people here in general think me ill used , which I make no doubt proceeded from misrepresentation , and although I would not condescend to tax Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Joyner	PERSON	, -LRB- the Person who was suspected -RRB- before I had related to you the manner of the Powder being left here , and requesting the favo -LSB- ur -RSB- of you to acquaint me , who the ungenerous Person was that presumed to make so free with my Conduct , but as Captain
Joyner	PERSON	has declared to one of my Officers who spoke to him on the Subject that he was innocent of the matter ー gives me occasion once more to repeat my requisition , and I shall take it as a singular favor if you will let me know as much as you conveniently can , being fully convinced I have been unfairly dealt with in some representation , if not with regard to the Powder , or I flatter myself the
Council of Safety	ORGANIZATION	would not have encouraged
Joyner	PERSON	or -LSB- Tunes -RSB- Teabout -LSB- Tibout -RSB- to raise an
Artillery Company	ORGANIZATION	on this Island which must be taken from the Militia , and their view or expectation is to have that Company under their Command entirely exclusive of meー As the
Council of Safety	ORGANIZATION	is so far distant from this County , can not know its circumstances and Scituation so well as I do , immagine they would not take a Step of that Sort without knowing my opinion as they must be fully convinced that I am actuated by no other motive than the good of my Country , and hope they will not be misled by two Men who are of no influence or consequence in this County or even in this
Town	LOCATION	where they are best known this is not only my opinion but that of the princ -LSB- ipal -RSB- Gentlemen of this place to who I have communicated my Sentiments on the Subject of an Artillery Companyー As a proof of Mr
Joyners	PERSON	influence and Conduct on the expedition he was sent to take the Powder from -LSB-
Richard -RSB- Maitland	PERSON	, you may form some Idea , when I tell you that some days after my return from
Charles Town	PERSON	I accidentall -LSB- y -RSB- fell in here , where I heard that a Canoe had come up from the
Camp	LOCATION	at Bloody point bringing an Account that
Joyner	PERSON	, had but fifteen Men , six of which were the provincial Recruits left at the Camp by Captain -LSB-
John -RSB- Barnwell	PERSON	, and I judgeing it expedient did send Captain
John Bull	PERSON	with upwards of twenty Volunteers , who staid with
Joyner	PERSON	and assisted in taking the Powder , and had he applied as he should have done to me I Could with the same ease have sent him two Hundred Men or more if necessary .

		I do not mean to claim any merit in my part or depreciate Mr
Joyner	PERSON	in your esteem but to shew you that he is a Man of no influence , and that a command of the sort he expects , will be takeing him entirely out of his Element ー In his own Sphere I would give him the preference of a Command to any Man in this Countyー You may perhaps be a little surprised to find 400 1b of Powder being again left here , which was mentioned to me , tho ' I approved of the Scheme , knowing the necessities of the People , to avoid Censure , I declined haveing anything to do with it ー I have the honor to be -LSB- & c. -RSB- Step n

		MAJOR GENERAL

Boston	LOCATION	August 20 1775 It may perhaps be asked in
England	LOCATION	ー what -LSB- is -RSB- the Admiral -LSB-
Samuel Graves	PERSON	-RSB- doing ?

		I wish I was able to answer that question satisfactorily .

		But I can only say what he is not doing .

		That He is not supplying the troops with sheep & oxen the dinners of the best of us bear -LSB- me -RSB- ager testimony ー the want of broth in the Hospitals bears a more melancholy one .

		He is not defending his own flocks & herds , for the enemy has repeatedly and in the most insulting manner , plundered his own appropriated islands .

		He is not defending the other islands in the harbour ; for the enemy landed in force , burned the lighthouse at noon day , & killed & took a party of marines almost under the guns of two or three men of war .

		He is not employing his ships to keep up communication & intelligence with the servants & friends of Government at different parts of the Continent , for I do not beleive Genl -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	has received a letter from any correspondent out of
Boston	LOCATION	these six weeks .

		He is surely intent upon greater objects you will think ー supporting in material points the dignity & terror of the British flag ー & where a number of boats have been built for the rebels , privateers fitted out , prices carried in , the King 's armed vessels sunk , the crews made prisoners , the officers killed ー He is doubt ー less enforcing instant restitution & reparation by the voice of his Cannon , and laying the towns in ashes which refuse his terms ー Alass !

		He is not ー The British thunder -LSB- is -RSB- diverted or controlled by pitiful attentions & quaker-like scruples ; & under such influence Insult -LSB- and -RSB- Impunity , like Righteousness & peace , have kissed each other .

		I should have hesitated in giving an account that may appear invidious , had not the facts been too notorious to expose me to that censure , & my feelings in this great cause too sensible to observe them without some impatience .

		1 About a week ago a small sloop from this town boarded a snow from
England	LOCATION	, in -LSB- St. -RSB-
Augustine Bay	LOCATION	, and carried off between twelve and fourteen thousand pounds of powder , mostly belonging to the King .

		She had been sent privately with thirty resolute men , well armed , by our
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, in order to intercept the vessel on the coast , but was disappointed , being rather too late , for there were forty thousand pounds landed , with four brass field pieces , the day before our sloop boarded her .

		There were twelve soldiers sent from
Augustine	PERSON	to assist and defend the snow , to whom our people gave ten guineas for helping them out with the powder , and being so modest as not to resist .

		A man of war was in sight , but fortunately aground the few hours our people stayed .

		We spiked up the snow 's guns , and then went off triumphant , although attacked by three boats full of armed men .

		One got within a hundred and fifty yards , it being quite calm , but that moment a fresh gale sprang up .

		Our people brought their booty safe to
Beaufort	LOCATION	, a town on the coast , about seventy miles S.W. of this place .

		It was reported they were pursued by the armed vessels from
Augustine	LOCATION	; to which place , on hearing of this , our Council of Safety despatched fifteen artillery men and fifteen grenadiers , by water , and a company of our provincials to

		Sundry letters from
John Macartney	PERSON	,
Esq	PERSON	; Commander of his Majesty 's ship Mercury , to
Paul Loyall	PERSON	, Esq ; Mayor , were laid before the Hall , and the Hall taking the same into their serious consideration , and being greatly surprised at the contents thereof , it was thereupon Resolved , that the letters from Capt.
Macartney	PERSON	to the worshipful the Mayor , were evidently intended to alarm and intimidate the inhabitants of this borough , were disrespectful to the chief magistrate of this corporation , are an officious intermeddling in the civil government of the town , and contain an implied threatening which the Hall conceive , to be unjustifiable , premature , and indecent .

		Unjustifiable inasmuch as no reason can be deduced from fact , or any authority be derived from law , to empower Capt
Macartney	PERSON	, unsolicited by the magistracy , to interfere in matters within their jurisdiction alone , and much less to hold up to them the idea of violence and compulsion , in a transaction so entirely without the line of his department .

		Premature , as his conduct in this instance , originates from ill grounded suppositions and mistaken apprehensions , and without any sanction from facts to support them .

		Indecent , because it imp -LSB- l -RSB- icitly charges the magistracy with a wilful remissness in the exercise of the powers legally vested in them ; because the menace is as particularly pointed against them , as if they were the abettors of riot and persecution ; because it operates towards the destruction of the persons and properties of a number of his Majesty 's subjects , chiefly on account of some accidental insults alledged to have been offered by a few incautious youth , to an individual ; because so little regard is shewn to the understandings and feelings of people , as , at the same moment in which this haughty declaration , so big with ruin , is denounced , it is pretended that the execution of it , is to preserve the persons and properties of his Majesty 's subjects ; as if the utter destruction of their lives and estates , could ever be deemed a preservation of their persons and properties .

		Resolved , That the military power , agreeable to the British constitution , is and ought to be under the controul of the civil ; and notwithstanding the utterly defenceless state of the town , the body corporate of this borough will never tamely submit to the invasion of their privileges , by the dangerous and untimely interposition of military force .

		Resolved , that this corporation will continue steadfastly to adhere to those substantial principles of good government which ought to actuate the minds of all His Majesty 's faithful subjects ; and that they embrace this opportunity to make this public and solemn declaration , that notwithstanding their exposed and defenceless situation which can not be remedied , unbiassed with fear , unappalled at the threats of unlawful power , they will never desert the righteous cause of their country , plunged as it is into dreadful and unexpected calamities .

		Ordered , that a copy of this resolution be , by the Mayor , transmitted to
John Macartney	PERSON	,
Esq	PERSON	; commander of his Majesty 's ship Mercury .

		I beg your Lordship to accept my Congratulations upon his Maj. gracious Appointment of you to the Government of
South Carolina	LOCATION	, and my hearty wishes that your Lordship may have a successul Administration ; although the Accounts you have given me of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Affairs in that Province are unpromising indeed .

		It gives me particular uneasiness that so far from being able to increase the Number of the
Kings Ships	ORGANIZATION	at
South Carolina	LOCATION	I am under the necessity of ordering the Tamer hither .

		Your Lordship may have been informed of her very bad Condition from Captain -LSB-
Edward -RSB- Thornborough	PERSON	, and of the almost impossibility of her remaining any longer in the Service without the greatest Risque .

		For a small time only your Lordship will be without any
King	ORGANIZATION	's Ship on the
Carolina Station	ORGANIZATION	, but whenever the Squadron is reinforced , or I am otherwise enabled you may depend upon having every assistance in my Power .

		The necessity of a frequent Intercourse between the Colonies and
Boston	LOCATION	, and for Frigates and small Vessels to be within each Government is evident ; but My Lord 't is a most distressing Situation to Know this , and yet be incapable of sending such succours to all Parts of the Continent as the Exigencies of the King 's Service make absolutely necessary .

		I am much obliged to your Lordship for your good opinion of my Zeal for the King 's Service , and hope you will consider in its true light the urgent necessity of calling away the
Tamer	PERSON	, in whose room I will send the very first Sloop I have to spare .

		Service did not allow of my sending a Sloop of War to
Savannah	LOCATION	, according to my Directions from my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty , it has not , in your Excellencys opinion , been detrimental to the Kings Interest within your Government ; 2 however as that may not long continue to be the case I consider myself still obliged to send a Sloop whenever it is in my Power .

		Lord
Wm. Campbell	PERSON	and Governor
-LSB- Josiah -RSB- Martin	PERSON	have made Representations to the same effect with your Excellency , and have earnestly requested that means be used to keep a constant and frequent Intercourse between the
Southern Colonies and Boston	ORGANIZATION	; but as I do not think it safe for any other Vessels but Men of War to be employ 'd on this Service , we must be denied this pleasure untill the Number of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	is increased , when I shall do the utmost in my power on this and every other occasion for the good of the
King 's Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is certainly reported here that four hundred Barrels of the Kings Gunpowder intended for

		The ultimate determination of Government with respect to these Colonies is hourly Expected ; if it is determined on to support the

		-LSB- '' -RSB- I can not avoid remarking to You & the Gentlemen of His Majestys Council , that notwithstanding
Gunpowder & Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	may have been fairly imported to these Islands yet I presume the selling them as Merchandize to the No American Traders , at a time their Countrymen are declared to be in open rebellion will be deemed Treasonable especially as the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	proclamation for prohibiting the exportation of

Portland	LOCATION	, English Harbour ,

North America	LOCATION	, go to the
French Dutch & Danish Islands	ORGANIZATION	in these Seas and offer unlimited prices for Gunpowder and other
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	, I think it my duty , as Commander in Chief of the Kings Ships and Vessels employ 'd on this station to acquaint you therewith , and to express my apprehension ; that as many of the North America Traders come in daily to all His Majts
Caribbee Islands	LOCATION	, where tis probable they may use the like endeavours to purchase Gunpowder & c at any rate and perhaps the great price offered for these articles may tempt private adventurers to run risques and dispose of the same to them , which must prove to the utmost disservice to His Majesty , by thus assisting the North Americans with ammunition & Warlike stores at a time they are declared to be in open Rebellion .

		I do therefore entreat , you will cause this matter to be duly considered in your Council , and be pleased to direct that a proclamation may be immediately issued through the different islands of this Government , to forbid the shipping Gunpowder or other Warlike stores , either Coastwise or otherwise by any Ships or Vessels , whatever , for the space of six months .

		I have inclosed herewith a Copy of His Majts Order in Council of the 5th April last , for prohibiting the exporting out of the

		REPORT OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON FORTIFICATIONS TO THE PORTSMOUTH ,
NEW HAMPSHIRE	LOCATION	, COMMITTEE OF SAFETY 1 In consequence of a vote of this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to us Directed we have viewed the several advantageous pieces of ground for erecting Fortifications to annoy our Enemies from making attack , or commitg any outrageous Insult upon the Defenceless Capital of this Province : and we do report as follows , viz. 1st .

		That we most humbly conceive that an Entrenchment hove up on the height of
Seavy 's Island	LOCATION	so called with two Twenty four Pounders & four or six smaller Cannon -LRB- filled also with musqutry -RRB- would greatly Retard the progress of any ships-of-war sailing up the
River	LOCATION	.

		2dly .

		That a Battery erected at
Peirce	PERSON	's Island of light Heavy Cannon .

		wou 'd greatly annoy the Enemy 's advances , if not Totally disconcert their Intentions , -LRB- by carrying away Masts , Rigging , & c. -RRB- 3dly .

		That
John Langdon	PERSON
Esqrs Island	LOCATION	is a most Extraordinary Peice of Ground -LRB- form 'd by nature -RRB- for a Fortification that commands the River from
Henderson	PERSON	's Point so caled , and capable of mounting fifty Heavy Cannon , and wou 'd Inevitably Oblige any ship to Remove that would attempt to lye before the Town .

		4thly .

		That a Battery of six
Heavy Cannon on Church Hill	ORGANIZATION	wou 'd be of Infinite service in cannonading any ships of War whatever from
Henderson	PERSON	's Point up the River & before the Town .

		Annexed to this is an Inventory of Cannon & stores now in the Town ー all of which we submit to the Superiour Judgment of the

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES TO
FRANCIS LEGGE	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF NOVA SCOTIA 1 Sir ,
Preston Boston	ORGANIZATION	23 August 1775 I am to thank your Excellency for three Letters by the Pacquet , one inclosing an Affidavit .

		What relates to the
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia Privateers	ORGANIZATION	being on this Coast , and of the force there mentioned is not to be credited .

		I have letters from Captain
-LSB- James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	who has visited the Vineyard ,
Montock	LOCATION	,
Gardiners	LOCATION	, and Fishers Islands not a Fortnight since , and he does not mention a Syllable of any Privateers but those of
Providence	LOCATION	, which are Kept in the River by our Ships .

		However I do not slight the information but think it probable that all the Colonies will have
Cruizers	PERSON	.

		I shall endeavour to keep a pretty good force in your Neighbourhood , and then it will not be difficult to frustrate any designs the Rebels may have on your Excellency 's Government , now become almost the only Resource we have on the Continent .

		The Diligent is certainly taken by Surprize .

		The Account of the
Philadelphia Sloop	ORGANIZATION	with Provisions I believe is also indisputable ; but I suspect she was bound there , and that the carrying in is a trick to answer some purpose .

		The Merlin sails Today or Tomorrow with eighteen Transports for the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	.

		We can not but be extremely obliged for the refreshments we draw from your Excellency 's Government , and I hope there is no private transaction inconsistent with the Generals and my Application to your Excellency , but except what the
Pacquet	LOCATION	has now brought I know but of one Vessel that has twice brought us Cattle from
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	; so that I apprehend there may be Exportations with your Excellency 's Pass that do not come to us .

		I shall do all in my Power to prevent an abuse of your Excellency 's Indulgence , and beg may be acquainted if any such discovery is made .

Port Bill	LOCATION	, and of any Ports being free and open , is that they continued their Trade to
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
British Islands	LOCATION	in the

		Whereas between the 19th of June and this Date , the said
Wallace	PERSON	hath released and given up above Ten Sail of Vessels from Hispaniola and other Ports , loaded with Molasses , Sugar , Coffee , Wine , & c. & c .

		This partial conduct of Cap'n
Wallace	PERSON	we can not account for , certainly we must recover adequate Damages of him , if all Law and Justice is not abrogated with you , for which purpose we have made a legal protest , and perhaps may be the subject of Litigation in your Courts of Law ... The Depredations committed by this petty Tyrant upon our Trade and the defenceless Town of
Newport	LOCATION	is shocking to human Nature , he is a savage beyond belief and description ; you know we have three other Vessels at
Jamaica	LOCATION	that it 's probable will fall into his hands , as we daily expect them .

		We do not expect any favour , as we have no connection with Scotch Men , whose influence intirely governs him , and whose principals are notoriously abhorrent to the present Family , at least those who reside with us are peculiarly so ... -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		I went with Captain
Stewart	PERSON	Yesterday & sounded the Channel Near the Point next below Windmill Point , am of an opinion that a stand may be made there ; but should better Judges think the Il au Noix or some Place below that better to intrench & effectually stop the Enemies Vessels coming that up , I shall perfectly agree with them If the
Army	ORGANIZATION	are not ready to march within the time abovementioned a Plan of this Kind must be executed , or we lose all -LRB- e.i -RRB- the

Asia	LOCATION	, August 24 , 1775 After the Event of last Night , I think it necessary to inform you , that having Information that it was intended by some People in New-York to take away the Guns from the Battery , which , as Stores belonging to the King , it was my Duty to protect .

		I sent a Boat to lie near the Shore , to watch their Motions ; soon after Twelve they began to move the Guns from the Battery , which being observed by the Officer in the Boat , he left his Station to come on board to inform me thereof , but being perceived from the Shore , he was fired upon by a great many Musketry , by which one of the Men in the Boat was shot dead .

		My Duty called upon me to repel an Attack of this Sort , as well as to defend the Guns , which occasioned me to fire upon the Battery .

		I acquaint you with this that the People of the Town may not imagine it is my Intention to do them any Hurt , which I wish as much as possible to avoid ; but if they will persist in behaving in such a Manner as to make their Safety and my Duty incompatible , the Mischiefs that may arise must lie at their Doors , and not mine .

		An Answer is desired .

		Whereas a Boat belonging to his Majesty 's Ship Asia -LRB- under my Command -RRB- was between 12 and 1 o'clock this Morning , fired upon by a Number of People , from the Walls of the City ; by which firing one Man in the said Boat was shot dead .

		CAPTAIN
GEORGE VANDEPUT	PERSON	, R.N. , TO VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- August 24th -LSB- 1775 -RSB- I had written thus far , last Night when information was sent me from the Shore that some of the
Rebel Troops	ORGANIZATION	raised in this Town , intended Stealing the Guns from off the Battery in the Night , as it was too dark to see the Battery , and I knew they would conduct this with so much Silence that we should not be able to hear them , I sent a Boat to be near the Shore .

		About Twelve we saw lights passing on the Battery very distinctly , and about a Quarter of an hour afterward the Officer in the Boat having plainly discovered what they were about , left his Station to return onboard and thinking himself clear enough of the Battery he fired a Musket to give me the Alarm .

		this was instantly answered from the Shore by a Volley of Small Arms , and returned by us by two Guns , which stopp 'd their Fire ; the Boat soon after-wards came onboard with one Man kill 'd ; we then fired again , and after some time , seeing a great Number of Lights , and they at the same time firing Small Arms at the Ship , we fired a Broadside after which we saw no more Lights .

		At day light we found they had removed twenty one Guns that were on Carriages on the Saluting Battery .

		They had -LRB- as I have since heard by a Person who has escaped from Shore -RRB- so well prepared every thing for this Robbery , that having but a very little way to draw them , 'till they would be under Cover of the Houses , it would have scarcely been possible to have prevented it had it been day Light , As our Guns were pointed as near to the Battery as possible , there is scarce any damage done to the Town , and none of the People hurt ; three of the Soldiers I hear are Wounded , but none killed ー The People are leaving Town in great Numbers which I suppose most of them will do , who may have it in their power .

		the Person who gave me the information Yesterday , told me at the same time , that they had long talked of attempting to burn the Ship with Fire Stages , and that now they certainly meant to do it if possible , beyond doubt such an Attempt in a dark night and in a strong Tide is feasible , tho ' I do not think they will venture it , if they should it will be for the safety of the Ship to move some distance lower down , where the
River	LOCATION	is Wider and the Tide not so strong .

		I wrote this Morning to the Mayor and other Magistrates informing them of the reasons of our Firing and warning them to prevent any further Occasion being given .

		not having received any Answer I this Evening sent another Letter -LRB- the copy of which I herewith enclose -RRB- and had one immediately in return from the Mayor , telling me that I shall receive a full answer tomorrow morning to my Lettersー 1 .

		NARRATIVE OF THE OCCURRENCES IN
NEW YORK	LOCATION	ON AUGUST 24 , 1775 1 The
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	having resolved that the Cannon should be removed from the Battery , a Number of the
Citizens	ORGANIZATION	collected for that Purpose last Wednesday Evening ; and , Part of the
Provincial Artillery	ORGANIZATION	, under the Command of Capt.
John Lamb	PERSON	, were posted on the Battery , to .

		prevent the
Landing of any Party	ORGANIZATION	from the
Asia	LOCATION	Man of War , to annoy them while at work .

		When they Marched down , which was about 11 o'clock , they observed one of the above Ship 's Barges lying at some Distance from the Shore , where she continued upwards of an Hour ; then she got under
Sail	PERSON	and fired a Musket at the Men that were posted on the Battery .

		This was immediately returned by a smart Fire of Musketry from the Artillery , and a few of the
Independent Light-Infantry	ORGANIZATION	belonging to Col. -LSB-
John -RSB- Lasher	PERSON	's Battalion , that were likewise posted there for the above Purpose .

		ー Soon after this the
Asia	LOCATION	fired three Cannon , when our Drums beat to Arms , which alarmed the Inhabitants ; when they had assembled she began a heavy and smart Fire , of Nine , Eighteen , and Twenty-four Pounders , and some Grape Shot ; succeeded by a Discharge of & Musketry from the Marines : But without doing any other Mischief than damaging the upper Part of several Houses near the
Fort	LOCATION	, and
White-Hall	LOCATION	, and wounding three Men .

		Notwithstanding the Fire from the
Asia	LOCATION	, the
Citizens	ORGANIZATION	effected their Purpose , and carried off Twenty-one Pieces of Cannon , being all that were mounted on Carriages .

		ー Since this Disturbance the Women and Children have been continually moving out of Town , with their most valuable Effects .

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM NEW-YORK , AUGUST 24 -LSB- 1775 -RSB- '' 1 Yesterday our
Congress	ORGANIZATION	directed that the cannon on the battery should be removed , and last night it was put in execution .

		The man of war 's folks had got intelligence of it and sent the barge to watch ; our people had removed 9 or 11 -LRB- it is uncertain which -RRB- of the cannon without molestation ; then a man in the stern of the barge made a false fire ー this happened about half past 12 last night .

		The barge 's people then fired ball , upon which ours -LRB- who had got together -RRB- were ordered to fire , which they did , and continued it till the barge got out of reach .

		From the cries and shrieks of the people on board it is thought some of them were much wounded .

		While the small arms were firing the man of war began ー she first fired a single ball ; then a ball and grape shot , afterwards several guns , -LRB- I do n't know what they were loaded with -RRB- and then a broadside ; we had more guns and another broadside before all was over , however our people effected their purpose and got away all the cannon that was mounted , I believe about 20 in number .

		As we had nothing but small arms we could do no damage to the man of war , and she did very little to us .

		A house next to
Roger Morris	PERSON	's and Black
Sam	PERSON	's , at the corner by the Exchange , each had an eighteen pound ball shot into their roofs ; some other houses suffered a little , but the principal damage was sustained by some small buildings adjoining to the Battery .

		No lives were lost , and but very few of our people wounded that I can learn of , and those but slightly .

		It was very distressing to see women and children moving half naked at midnight .

		`` EXTRACT OF ANOTHER LETTER FROM
NEW YORK	LOCATION	, THURSDAY , -LRB- AUGUST 24 -RRB- -LSB- 1775 -RSB- 8 o'clock . ''

		1 We were suddenly alarmed this morning about half past 12 o'clock , by the
Asia	LOCATION	man of war , cannonading our town , both with grape shot and ball , which continued until 3 o'clock , with short intervals , without doing much damage , except firing into some houses near the fort , and wounding three or four of our men .

		I learn it happened in the following manner ー A party of our light infantry and citizens about 60 , commanded by the brave Capt.
-LSB- Dirck -RSB- Hanson	PERSON	, were busy in removing the cannon from the battery , when they were discovered by the people on board who sent their boat on shore armed .

		When they came within 20 or 30 yards of the shore they made a signal to the man of war , who immediately fired upon our people , which was answered by a volley from the barge , without doing execution , as our men were all under cover of the battery , they returned the fire immediately upon the barge , and it is supposed must have killed a good many of them , as they heard a great crying among them , and they directly put off to the ship .

		Our militia behaved with a good deal of spirit , and turned out extraordinary well .

		What will be the consequence of this unhappy affair , God only knows .

		My dear friend , the scene is now open here , we know what we have to depend upon , every friend to his country ought not to hesitate a moment what step to take .

		I just learn

SIMEON DEANE	PERSON	TO
SILAS DEANE	PERSON	,
CONNECTICUT	LOCATION	DELEGATE TO THE
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	CONGRESS 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
New York	LOCATION	, 24th August , 1775 .

		Last night we had a brush with the
Asia	LOCATION	ship of war , tho ' but little damage done , considering the guns fired .

		Particulars are , that it was last night concerted to remove the cannon and warlike stores from the Battery , of which the ship was previously informed by some of their good Tory friends here ; and being -LSB- provi -RSB- ded with a spring on her cable , and every necessary for engagement , at about long musket shot from the battery in
North River	LOCATION	.

		Our people came to the guns about 11 o'clock , with much silence , but found the Ship 's boats full of men , lying very silently on their oars at about fifty or sixty yards distant ; and on their beginning to move a cannon , they made signal by a fuse in their boat and discharge of a musket or two on us , which was instantly followed by a cannon-ball from the Ship .

		On which Capt. -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB- Lamb ordered Fire , and there was a discharge of forty or fifty muskets into their boats , who made the best of their way on board .

		The Ship then fired two more cannon , with langrage & c. , which wounded one or two of our men .

		During this there was a great alarm through the city ; the drums beating to arms , & c. & c. , and the poor women and children screaming and flying from the city .

		After a cessation of about fifteen minutes , -LRB- during all which time we were drawing away the cannon , -RRB- they fired another shot into the Battery ; on which we gave three Huzzas , and one imprudent fellow fired a musket , contrary to orders .

		The Ship gave us almost her whole broadside , being 9 , 18 , & 24 lb .

		shot , with two swivel balls accompanying each large shot , as we find in several places where they struck in range on the fence , houses , & c .

		This redoubled the consternation , and vast numbers of helpless wretches fled into the fields , & c. Others , in coaches , carriages & c. left the town in a hurry .

		After which , all was tolerably quiet .

		This morning we find many shot holes in the houses , and particularly in the fence at the lower Barracks .

		One 24 lb .

		ball went through and through the
Barracks	ORGANIZATION	, and then thro ' two bbls of flour on board a vessel in
Whitehall Slip	ORGANIZATION	, where it stopped .

		Early , a company of soldiers are dispatched to
Long Island	LOCATION	to seize Govr -LSB-
William -RSB- Tryon	PERSON	and Capt.
-LSB- George -RSB- Vandeput	PERSON	, who are both said to be there .

		The remaining troops are going this afternoon to carry the shot from the lower Battery , which will bring cannonading enough , I expect .

		The Ship now appears to be very well prepared , and they are continually levelling their guns , as the tide rises or falls .

		Were it not for the expectation of being a spectator of the fray , I would set out this afternoon ; but shall not tarry long here .

		The Tories here are pretty silent and look wild .

		The warm Whigs curse their Provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, as being infested with -LSB- too ma -RSB- ny scabby sheep .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are taking depositions concerning last night 's work , as 't is said the people here are charg 'd by the Ship with firing first and killing six of their seamen .

		We have drawn twenty-one fine Pieces with good carriages , up to the Green , and expect to get the others this afternoon .

Simeon Dean	PERSON	-LSB- e -RSB- .

		P.S. Capt.
Lawrence	PERSON	, of an armed Schooner here , was last night intercepted with letters from
Govr Tryon	PERSON	to

		We have been honored with your favor of the 21st Inst , and are very sorry to learn the apprehensions you express that the progress of the army may be impeded , if not disappointed , for the want of Tentsー The fact is that all the Tents we had ; and all the materials that could be procured , have been made up into Tents & forwarded with part of our own troops ; and Genl -LSB-
Philip -RSB- Schuyler	PERSON	has undoubtedly ` ere now disposed of them , as circumstances , or the necessity of the service may require .

		We can only add on that subject that we shall procure materials for more Tents by every means in our power , and send them up to General
Schuyler	PERSON	as soon as possible , but we see no probability of being able to provide at any rate a sufficient number for the N -LSB- orthern -RSB-
Army	ORGANIZATION	ー If therefore materials can be collected in any due season in your -LSB- Government -RSB- it will promote the general service to give the necessary orders for that purpose without delay ー The precautions about the Pork , which you permitted Mr
Van Rensselaer	PERSON	to purchase , may be a wise one , but unless proper orders are lodged at the different landings to which it may be carted , the purpose for which it is wanted may be in a great measure defeatedー Permit us therefore to request the favor of you to give such directions , as you shall judge necessary to prevent such inconveniences and disappointmentsー We have the honour to remain -LSB- & c. -RSB- P V B

New York	LOCATION	25th August 1775 Sir In answer to your two Letters of yesterday , relating to the firing upon the Barge belonging to the Ship under your Command , and the taking away the Cannon from the Battery , we are to acquaint you , that it appears from a great Number of Affidavits that the People did not fire from the Battery till they were first fired upon with a Musket from the Barge the Ball from which they Swear passed very near several of them ー As to the taking away the Cannon we are to inform you , that the same were taken away by Permission of the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, now sitting in this City , who the People have thought proper to constitute to act for them , in this critical Situation of Publick Affairs .

		ー Our Duty now calls upon us to acquaint you that we are at a loss to account how you could be obliged in duty to fire upon the City in defence of these Guns , in the heart of the Seat of Civil Government , neither can we Account what inducement there could be to fire a Broad Side upon the City at large , half an hour after the Barge had returned to the Ship and the Cannon had been all removed from the Battery ー You may rest assured we shall take the necessary Steps in our Power in the Affair agreable to

GEORGE VANDEPUT	PERSON	, R.N. , TO MAYOR
WHITEHEAD HICKS	PERSON	1 Sir ,
Asia	LOCATION	,
N. River	LOCATION	, Aug. 25 , 1775 .

		I have just now received yours ; in return to which I am to acquaint you that the Musket fired from our Boat , was fired as a
Signal	ORGANIZATION	towards the Ship , and not at the Battery , as the People in the Boat will likewise make their Affidavits of .

		You say you are at a Loss to account how my Duty could oblige me to fire upon the City , in defence of those Guns , in the Seat of civil Government ; and you add , that you can neither account for my Inducement , half an Hour after the return of the Boats and the Removal of the Cannon , for firing a Broadside at the City at large .

		You surely can not doubt its being my Duty to defend every Part of the King 's Stores , wherever they may be : For this Purpose I fired upon the Battery , as the only Means to prevent the Intentions of the People employed in removing the Guns .

		For a considerable Time I thought they had desisted from their Purpose , till their huzzaing and their firing from the Walls upon the ship , convinced me to the contrary ; this occasioned the Broadside to be fired , not at the City at large , but as the most effectual Method to prevent their persisting in their Pursuit , which it were impossible I could tell they had effected .

		I have no more to add , but that I shall persist in doing what I know to be my Duty : In the doing which I shall , if possible , avoid doing Hurt to any one .

		I am , Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB- .

		And amongst other measures for obtaining this most desiralble purpose , this Assembly is persuaded , that the building and equipping an American fleet , as soon as possible , would greatly and essentially conduce to the preservation of the lives , liberty and property of the good people of these Colonies and therefore instruct their delegates to use their whole influence at the ensuing congress for building at the

		On Wednesday night , a number of people of this city , proceeded -LRB- according to a resolve of the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to take off the cannon that were mounted on the Battery , and were desired to be as silent as possible to prevent being discovered by the
Asia	LOCATION	man of war , when they came there they observed two of the man of war 's barges , lying a little distance off , from which it is evident that some infernal villain and enemy to the country , had informed Capt.
-LSB- George -RSB- Vandeput	PERSON	of their design ; however they began dragging the cannon with the utmost expedition ; when they had got twelve or thirteen away , the barges rowed within musket shot of the Battery , and then fired , which was immediately returned by Capt. -LSB-
John	PERSON	-RSB- Lamb 's company of Artillery ; the man of war fired three shot which alarmed the city ; the drums beat to arms , and the inhabitants mustered as far as possible ; this did not deter our people from pursuing their design , but they hauled away the cannon with as much spirit as before ; the man of war then began firing very hot with grape shot , eighteen and twenty-four pounders , and volleys from the tops ; all this time the people kept dragging the cannon up the
Broad-Way	LOCATION	, and did not desist till they had got them all ranged before the Liberty-Pole ; though the Battery and streets were full of people , happily no lives were lost , their guns were well levelled , and the balls came singing over our people 's heads , and on all sides as thick as hail ; the fence between the Fort and Battery , and the houses around , are full of shot holes , and a number of balls found in the houses .

		It occasioned a great consternation among the women and children ; numbers of people have moved , and are still moving their effects out of town : We had only two men wounded , which is almost incredible , considering the numbers that were on the Battery at the time of the attack .

		There was one man killed , and four or five wounded belonging to the boats .

		The Hall has made some resolves on them , a copy of which I am directed to enclose you .

		My reason for not publishing the letters in this week 's paper is , that as they are of a threatening nature , they might perhaps give the people of this colony great uneasiness ; to prevent which , I think there can not be too much precaution used , as I am willing to believe your intentions are only to act within your own sphere , and not to intermeddle with the internal policy of this corporation .

DAVID WOOSTER	PERSON	TO
P. V. B. LIVINGSTON	PERSON	, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK PROVINCIAL CONGRESS 1 Sir , Oyster Ponds , 27th Aug. 1775 Your favour of the 11th instant , came duly to hand , and I should have sailed for Haerlem , without loss of time , had I not received the following important intelligence from Gen.
Washington	LOCATION	, viz. Aug. 23 , 1775 .

		ー Yesterday I received advice from
Boston	LOCATION	, that a number of transports have sailed on a second expedition , for fresh provisions : As they may pursue the same course , only advancing further , we think Montaug -LSB- Montauk -RSB- point , on
Long Island	LOCATION	, a very probable place of their landing ; I have therefore thought best to give you the earliest intelligence ; but I do not mean to confine your attention or vigilance to that place ; you will please to extend your views as far as the mischief may be probably extended .

		ー Thus far the intelligence .

		I will further inform you , that the King 's Fisher , last Wednesday -LSB- August 23 -RSB- went up the Sound , with several small cutters , reconnoitring the north side of the island ; and Thursday there followed past this place two top-sail vessels , which I apprehend to be transports , as they fired two signal guns when they went thro ' the Race .

		ー I would therefore recommend it to the provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, to keep a good guard upon Queen 's County , as I imagine their design is to get stock from
Huntington	LOCATION	,
Lloyd	ORGANIZATION	's Neck , or
Flushing	LOCATION	; and as we hope to secure all the stock upon this part of the island , you may expect the
Boston fleet	ORGANIZATION	will proceed farther up Sound .

		I congratulate you on the plentiful Year with you as well as with us .

		It makes me smile to see in the English Papers , the Ignorance of some of their Political Writers , who fancy we can not continue the Non Importation Agreement ; because if we do it must starve us .

		I lament with you the Want of a naval Force .

		I hope the next Winter will be employ 'd in forming one .

		When we are no longer fascinated with the Idea of a speedy Reconciliation , we shall exert ourselves to some purpose .

Annapolis	LOCATION	27th Augst 1775 .

		The
Communication of Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	, of any sort indeed , from
America	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	, as must be well known by your Lordship being so difficult ー I hope I stand in need of no further Apology for not having wrote oftener , than adding that , 'till lately , I have had nothing material from this Province to communicate , which was not in common with what regarded the proceedings of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and what Your Lordship would have the fullest Information of , in the Common Prints & General Accounts from the Northward .

		Having now a safe Opportunity , by a Ship of my
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, -LRB- The
Annapolis	LOCATION	, Captn Hanrick -RRB- I shall endeavour to lay before your Lordship two or three late Occurrences in this Province , which have given me great Uneasiness , but which I had no power to prevent , altho ' I had Influence enough to prevent the Excesses , at first proposed , being carried into Execution , in some Instances , and more especially with Regard to the Snow Adventure ,
Captn Henzell	PERSON	, belonging to Mr
Farness	PERSON	, in
London	LOCATION	, that came to this City with about seventy indented Servants , and the Captain , it seems , had brought out 200 Dozen of
Porter	LOCATION	, several Chaldrons of Coal , & some Ct of Cheese , under a Pretence , as alledged , of stopping at
Madeira	LOCATION	, and disposing of them there ; The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	therefore , thinking such a proceeding a premeditated
Infringement of the Association	ORGANIZATION	, ordered ` him to return to
England	LOCATION	, Servants and all .

		I contrived to have the Barbarity of such a Measure , where it so greatly affected the Servants and Passengers , represented ; and the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, on meeting again , thought proper to allow the Servants to be landed , and the Vessel to take in Water and Provisions for the passage home ; but the Captain by being too long in availing himself of that Indulgence was in some Danger of the Conflagration that Mr
Gildarts Ship	PERSON	-LRB- of
Liverpoole	LOCATION	-RRB- met with , for the particulars of which I must beg Leave in this place to refer Your Lordship to the enclosed papers , No. 1 , from me to the Officers of the
Customs	ORGANIZATION	here , & No. 2 , their Answer .

		... We have neither Troops nor Ships of War to support those who would -LRB- and I can assure Your Lordship there are many such -RRB- if they had such support to fly to , have long ago asserted the Rights of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and their own Liberties ー and are still ready , many of them , waiting only for such an Opportunity ... .

		I have entrusted this to the Care of Mr
Lloyd Dulany	PERSON	, who is leaving a considerable Estate here to escape with his Life from the persecution he has long been under , for having withstood every insidious and violent Attempt to draw him into Connections with men whose Measures he abhors and has resolutely opposed from the very first ... Many other Gentlemen of property , Character , & Family are leaving
America	LOCATION	, and I should be unjust to a particular Friend of mine , were I to omit mentioning and recommending to Your Lordship the Revd Mr -LSB-
Jonathan -RSB- Boucher	PERSON	, who is driven from his parish and possessions here , and goes home in the Choptank Frigate from
Patowmack	LOCATION	, in about ten days .

		he has ever been a firm Supporter of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	as well as of Government , and being particularly connected with me , can communicate to Your Lordship the Principle Occurrences in this province for some time past ; and knows very well every thing relative to all the great Men in
Virginia	LOCATION	ー He is a very sensible and intelligent Man , meriting the Patronage of Government to which he is steadily attached , and Your Lordship will find his Abilities very usefull .

		EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM
NEW YORK	LOCATION	TO A GENTLEMAN IN
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	, DATED AUGUST 28 , 1775 1 Thursday night -LSB- August 24 -RSB- we expected a repetition of Wednesday night 's scene ; women , children and goods were removed .

		All quiet at night .

		Friday , more expectations and more removals , the Governor returned from the country , and went in person and took in writing a particular account of the damage done ; our
Congress	ORGANIZATION	offered him a guard , but he said he had such confidence in the affections of his fellow citizens , that he thought any further security unnecessary , and declined the offer .

		He called the council that afternoon .

		Saturday , people continued to remove .

		The Governor desired a conference with our
Congress	ORGANIZATION	,
Committee	ORGANIZATION	and Military Officers ; it was granted , he made a speech to them , told them it made his heart bleed to meet on the road so many people moving from the city with their effects , that they had all the power of the city in their hands , begged they would use it prudently , that violent measures would only widen the breach , and cause the destruction of the city ; we had got the cannon in our own power , and desired we would move them no farther , that if troops should come from
Boston	LOCATION	, we would hear of it time enough to move them , but declared upon his honour he knew of none coming , & c. & c. Notwithstanding the cannonading , we got off 21 good 18-Pounders , with carriages , empty cartridges , rammers , sponges , & c. & c .

		The Capt. of the man of war behaved like a rascal in attacking the Town in the dead of the night , when it was unprepared for defence ; however the people collected on the battery , and behaved well ; we killed , according to -LSB-
George -RSB- Vandeput	PERSON	's own account , one of his men in the barge , he killed none of ours , ー only wounded three ; one lost the calf of his leg , the other two were slightly wounded , notwithstanding grape-shot , swivel shot , 18 and 24 pounders were fired .

		I am told people are moving their goods this morning .

Carolina	LOCATION	, August 28th 1775 Since my Dispatch No. 38 , giving your Lordship an Account of the outrages committed at
Fort Johnston	LOCATION	, I received by a tender from
New York	LOCATION	on the 22nd of last month , the Duplicate of your Lordship 's Dispatch No. 16 , which from its date must have accompanied your letter by the May mail , that were violated by the
Committee of Charles Town	ORGANIZATION	, as I have formerly represented , and was there with held , as appears evidently I think from the allusion to its contents in the Publication of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	at
Wilmington	LOCATION	in the enclosed paper of the 28th day of last month .

		I learn that the June mail is since arrived at
Charles Town	LOCATION	, and I flatter myself that the Postmaster persuant to my advice has lodged your Lordship 's dispatches to me in security on Board his Majesty 's Ship stationed there , but I have been deterred from sending for them as yet , by a strange and almost incredible rumour that there are armed Vessels fitted out by the people of
Charles Town	PERSON	, constantly cruizing off that place , of force superior to any Vessel we can get to send for them ... The probability of the Cruizer being compelled to leave her station here for want of provisions , or to cruize for smugglers or pirates , and the certainty in that case of the artillery belonging to
Fort Johnston	LOCATION	falling into the hands of the mob , determined me some weeks ago to spike the Guns , and to burn the carriages that were rotten and utterly unserviceable ... The sundry depositions of Masters of Ships enclosed will show your Lordship the motives & designs of the Rabble who did the Violence at
Fort Johnston	LOCATION	, that of Mr -LSB-

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 29 -LSB- August , 1775 -RSB- Until this period the Admiral had waited with great impatience expecting a large Reinforcement from
England	LOCATION	with Orders for his future proceedings ; and hoping that an Accomodation might yet take place between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her Colonies , he had confined his operations to intercepting the Supplies coming to the Rebels , and guarding those intended for the
Kings Army	ORGANIZATION	, endeavouring by these means , and by granting Convoys to the Transports and other Vessels employed in
America	LOCATION	in procuring Provisions Fuel and Forage , to relieve the Wants , and thereby assist the Garrison at
Boston	LOCATION	much as he could .

		But finding the Provinces were seriously preparing for War , although he was still without the least Instruction for his Guidance respecting the Rebellion he determined to wait no longer , but to annoy the Enemy in the best manner his small & crippled force would permit ; by making Descents within the
New England	LOCATION	Governments and destroying the Towns on the
Sea Coast	LOCATION	and the Shipping in the Harbours and Rivers .

		Indeed the Admiral had been ever desirous of sending forth such Expeditions , and had often by secret confidential Letters home , as well as abroad in discourse with the General , expressed his Wishes for 800 or 1000 Marines or Soldiers to go with the Shipping on these Enterprizes , as the sole means of destroying the Vessels and Craft of the Rebels in narrow Riven or Creaks , where
Ships of Force	ORGANIZATION	could not approach from the Shoalness of the Water , and where small Vessels could be destroyed by men posted in Bushes and under Cover of Walls or Banks along the Shore , unless protected by a Body of Soldiers to march upon the Margins of such Rivers and Creeks .

		I have received Advice that another Vessel belonging to one White at
Marblehead	LOCATION	whose ostensible Voyage was to
Casco Bay	LOCATION	, was carried in soon after .

		Such Instances of Avarice at such a Time , & in such a Cause , call for a severe Scrutiny & exemplary Punishment .

		Mr
Livingston	PERSON	& some other Gentlemen from your City brought us the acceptable News of the Arrival of a large
Quantity of Powder	ORGANIZATION	, and five Hundred Stand of Arms .

		Our Situation is such as requires your immediate assistance and Supply in that Article .

		We have lately taken Possession of a Hill considerably advanced towards the Enemy , but our Poverty prevents our availing ourselves of any Advantage of -LSB- the -RSB- Situation .

		I must therefore most earnestly entreat that Measures may be taken to forward to this
Camp	LOCATION	in the most safe & expeditious Manner whatever Ammunition can be spared from the immediate & necessary Defence of the Province .

		The Value of whatever may be sent in Consequence of this Request , will be paid by order from hence when delivered , or negotiated with the
Honble Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Philada	LOCATION	as may be agreed with the Proprietors .

		I only request that no Time may be lost thro ' any such difficulties , as our Situation is so critical , & the Exigencies so great .

		The Mode of Conveyance I must leave with the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	or the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of the City .

		I doubt not they will take every Precaution to make it safe & expeditious .

Providence	LOCATION	, August 30th , 1775 Sir , ー Your Excellency 's letter of the 14th instant is now before me , the contents of which I have duly considered .

		When it came to hand our small sloop-of-war was out upon the cruise which I mentioned to your Excellency in a former letter .

		She hath since returned .

		The sending her on the enterprize you proposed could not be done , without some new and further powers from the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, which sat here last week ; and the nature of the business was such that I did not think proper to lay it before so large a body .

		I therefore procured a committee to be appointed to transact all business necessary for the common safety during the recess of the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, particularly with power to employ the two vessels of war in such service as they should think necessary .

		The committee is summoned to meet this day before whom I shall lay your letter .

		At present the undertaking appears to me to be extremely difficult .

		The most suitable man we have for the purpose is confined to his bed by sickness .

		We have accounts that a number of vessels have sailed lately from
Boston	LOCATION	, which we apprehend , are designed to plunder the stock along the coast .

		The
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	have ordered it all to be removed from all the islands in this Colony excepting
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		We have now about three hundred men employed in that business ... The vessel our small sloop was cruising for , arrived on the 28th inst. , at
Norwich	LOCATION	.

		She hath brought powder , lead , flints and small arms .

		What quantity of each I am not certain .

		They are now on their way by land .

		`` EXTRACT OF A PRIVATE LETTER FROM
NEW YORK	LOCATION	, DATED WEDNESDAY , AUGUST 30 , 1775 '' 1 By the ship which brings you this you will undoubtedly receive the New York Papers containing an account of the conduct of Captain -LSB-
George -RSB- Vandeput	PERSON	of the
Asia	LOCATION	, in firing on the town to stop the removal of the cannon which were carrying away by order of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		These papers speak very disrespectfully of the Captain 's behaviour ; but I assure you they have treated him with great injustice , by charging him with cruelty and inhumanity .

		The case was briefly and truly this : Captain
Vendeput	PERSON	being informed that the people were removing his Majesty 's cannon , & c. he fired only a few shots into the town by way of intimidation , and to stop their progress , notwithstanding which they actually moved off near twenty pieces , and but three of the provincials were slightly wounded ; whereas had -LSB- he -RSB- been cruel or inhuman , he could soon have destroyed the whole town .

		A thief might with as much truth and reason complain of the cruelty of a man who should knock him down for robbing him !

		But the Patriots here constantly misrepresent every thing ; and our news-papers contain very little to be depended on .

Harbour Antigua	LOCATION	the 30th August 1775 .

		In Consequence of the Letter I received from Captain -LSB-
Henry -RSB- Bryne	PERSON	of the
Pomona	LOCATION	Sloop the 4th Instant , -LRB- of which I inclosed a Copy to you for their Lordships perusal the 8th August p the
Creighton	PERSON	,
Ross	PERSON	, Master -RRB- setting forth that a Schooner from
North America	LOCATION	arrived at the
Island St Croix	LOCATION	, in Order to procure
Gunpowder for America	ORGANIZATION	; and offering any Money for the Purchase & c , and it having since then , been intimated to me by
Persons of Credit	ORGANIZATION	, at this place ; that it is believed The North American Traders , do procure Gunpowder and other
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	from this
Island	LOCATION	, and His Majesty 's other
Charibbee Islands	LOCATION	; in these Seas ; as well as from the French , Dutch , and
Danish Islands	LOCATION	.

		I have therefore in Order to prevent , -LRB- as far as I may be able -RRB- a practice so pernicious and dangerous to His Majesty 's Service , wrote to the Governors , and the Commanders in Chief of all His Majesty 's
Charibbee Islands	LOCATION	, to acquaint them with my having received the above information ; and requested , they may immediately direct proclamations to be issued through the different
Islands	LOCATION	in their respective Governments , to forbid the Exportation of Gunpowder and other
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	, from any of them , for the Space of Six Months : and I have given Orders to the Captains of his
Majesty 's Ships Lynx	ORGANIZATION	,
Pomona	LOCATION	, and
Argo	ORGANIZATION	; to search all Vessels they may fall in with ; that are bound to
America	LOCATION	; and strictly to examine whether they have on board any Gunpowder ; or other
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	; and should they find any such , to Seize said Vessels and bring them forthwith to me ; I have inclosed herewith to you Copies of said Letters and Orders ; and request you will lay them before tny Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty ; who , I hope will approve of what I have done in this matter ; and as their ' Lordships will perceive by the Letter to me from the President and
Council of the Island Antigua	ORGANIZATION	, Dated St
John	PERSON	's
Council Chamber	ORGANIZATION	, 17th August , 1775 , they express `` that they have no
Authority	ORGANIZATION	to prevent the Buying and Selling of Merchandize which has been fairly imported '' under which description I presume they wish to include
Gunpowder and Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	; and to insinuate that private Adventurers are at full liberty to sell them as Merchandize to whomsoever they please ; and some of them , I am told likewise assert in Common discourse , they have no knowledge , but from report ; and rumour ; that the
People of North America	ORGANIZATION	are in open Rebellion ; as the same has not been Officially Notified to them by
Authority	ORGANIZATION	; from these Circumstances it is probable , Should His Majesty 's Ships under my
Command	ORGANIZATION	; in pursuance of the Orders I have given them , make Seizure of any American Vessels having Gunpowder & c. on board ; The people concerned therein will litigate and question the legality of the Seizures , and thereby put me to much trouble and Expence ; however as it appeared to me of the utmost Consequence to the good of His Majesty 's Service , that a practice so dishonourable and dangerous , should be immediately prevented , and put a Stop to ; so I have no doubt but their Lordships will fully approve of the Orders I have issued ; and give me all necessary Support to carry them into Execution .

		During the present Hurricane Season I can do little more with the Kings Ships under my Command , then sending t , hem to the
Southern Islands	LOCATION	for Security ; but their Lordships may depend so soon as the danger of Hurricanes is over I will employ them in such manner as shall appear to me most useful to the
Kings Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		I much further desire you will represent to their Lordships that should the present troubles in
America Continue	ORGANIZATION	, the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under my
Command	ORGANIZATION	is much too small to prevent effectually the
Exportation of Ammunition & c.	ORGANIZATION	from all the
Islands	LOCATION	within the Extent of my
Command	ORGANIZATION	, and that I intreat their Lordships will be pleased to encrease the Number of Ships to be employed in these Seas , and thereby enable me , to put an End to a Trade so very pernicious , and prevent for the future any
Supply of Ammunition and Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	to be carried from hence to the North Americans : during their present unnatural Hostilities .

		Sir I received your Letter of the 22d August on Sunday last about four of the clock in the afternoon , and them immediately appointed a meeting of His
Majts Council	ORGANIZATION	to be held in the town of
Basseterre	LOCATION	yesterday but there being no more than five members in this island , and one of them is so bad a state of health as to render him unable to attend , which I knew nothing of till the time appointed for the meeting , there was not a
Board	ORGANIZATION	to consider the subject matter of your letter , and to give me their opinion thereupon , and being in doubt whether such a proclamation as you desire me to issue would be compulsatory upon the people of this Government or not , as the Act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	on which His Majesty 's Order in
Council	ORGANIZATION	is grounded does not extend to this part of His Dominions , I have thought proper to write to Mr
Warner	PERSON	, His Majts Attorney General by this opportunity , to desire his opinion and advice upon this important Business , and hope when I receive his answer I shall be able to get a meeting of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	here and will then determine what to do .

		In the mean time you may be assured I shall be very ready to exert every means in my power to prevent the North Americans from being supplied in any degree with Ammunition and
Warlike Stores	ORGANIZATION	at this time when they are in open Rebellion .

		I am very glad to find from a Letter I have received from Mr President -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Jarvis	PERSON	dated the 24th Instant that there is no reason to believe they have had any supplies of Gun Powder from the island of
Antigua	LOCATION	and from the strictest enquiry I have been able to make there is none at any of the Forts in this
Island	LOCATION	, excepting a very little belonging to private Traders in the Magazines of
Fort Londonderry	LOCATION	near the town of

Martha	PERSON	's - Vineyard and the
Elizabeth Islands	LOCATION	, she stood into
Tarpaulin Cove	LOCATION	, close in with one of the Houses , where stood a Number of People without Arms , looking at the Ship ; when , without the least Provocation they received a Number of Cannon Balls , and some Musket Shot , from the Ship , which obliged them to secure themselves : After which the Ship fired a Number of Cannon Shot at the
House	ORGANIZATION	some , of which went through the same , and damaged several Barrels of Provisions & c. but happily no Person was killed or wounded .

		ー As soon as this was done , the ship immediately put about and came to Anchor at a considerable Distance from the Shore , and soon after made off .

		As the Enemy are greatly distressed for Want of fresh Provisions I conjectured this Fleet was designed to supply them ; and immediately sent a Quantity of Powder , Ball and Flints to

		COLONEL
GURDON SALTONSTALL	PERSON	TO
SILAS DEANE	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Dear Sir , ー
New London	LOCATION	, August 31st , 1775 .

		NE A.M. 6 o'clock .

		Yesterday morning we heard cannon firing and supposed it was off
Block Island	LOCATION	, and at eleven o'clock had advice that one man of war and three cutters were cannonading the houses at the Point in
Stonington	LOCATION	.

		The firing continued until 5 o'clock P.M. with very little cessation .

		We hear their landing was opposed by 200 men .

		Immediately on the first advice , I advised Major -LSB-
Jonathan	PERSON	-RSB- Lat -LSB- t -RSB- imer to march one half the troops under his command , about two hundred men , to
Stonington	LOCATION	, which he instantly did .

		Have no advice from thence , since three o'clock yesterday .

		It 's said a number of the enemy were killed on attempting to land , by the musketry ; the Americans had no cannon .

		The best account I can collect of the beginning of the dispute is , that the cutters chased into that harbor a boat from
Block Island	LOCATION	, with stock on board , and finding a vessel with molasses on board near the wharf , aground , immediately on her floating brought her to sale and sent her off ; and then , stretched backwards and forwards and gave the town their broadsides ; then stretched out , met a man of war , -LRB- supposed
Wallace	PERSON	, -RRB- and they all came into the harbor ;
Wallace	PERSON	came to , with a spring on his cable , and fired on the town incessantly until 5 o'clock .

		We are told a large number of transports were yesterday cruising round
Block Island	LOCATION	.

		There is very little stock taken off from thence .

		They have been re-inforced with 200 men , and one hundred
Islanders	ORGANIZATION	makes them probably able to prevent losing their stock , which they were endeavouring to take off .

		General -LSB-
David -RSB- Wooster	PERSON	is no doubt encamped with four hundred men at Montauge -LSB- Montauk -RSB- .

		The stock from
Gardner	PERSON	's and
Plumb Island	LOCATION	, undoubtedly removed .

		Advice from Gen.
Washington	LOCATION	to Gov.
Trumbull	PERSON	, that transports were bound this way , was dispatched Friday last -LSB- August 25 -RSB- to Gen.
Wooster	PERSON	, then at
Southold	LOCATION	, and to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of
Suffolk County	LOCATION	, from the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in this town .

		Six o'clock P.M. .

		About ten o'clock this day , the Rose , Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	, and three cutters with a few vessels taken at
Stonington	LOCATION	, left that harbor and anchored at west side
Fisher 's Island	LOCATION	, where they probably are .

		The houses at
Stonington	LOCATION	much shattered ; none actually demolished .

		It is extrerrlely difficult to know the first of the action , notwithstanding what 's within written ; rather think the case was thus ; the cutters chased in two
Rhode Island	LOCATION	packet boats , that carried 250 troops of theirs from
Stonington	LOCATION	harbor , and landed them on Block Island the night before , although the
Rose	PERSON	and the cutters endeavoured to prevent it : when the cutters were in port , they took two molasses vessels , and went to the wharf to take other vessels , and it 's most rob able were forbid , which no doubt produced high threats ; and on their persisting , it 's my opinion the Americans fired on them and did execution , as they immediately pushed off , and firing some cannon went out of harbor ; met the
Rose	PERSON	, probably east of
Watch Hill	LOCATION	, and she then stood in for the harbour with the cutters , and having got in , fired as within mentioned .

		A flag went on board the Rose at noon , to know why she fired on the houses ; Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	said he did so in his defence , and shewed the officer four of his dead men , and one that had his arm much torn ; -LRB- these men , I apprehend , were killed in the first action , and the cutter going out with them to the Rose , brought Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	in to the demolition of the town . -RRB-

		Immediately after the flag returned , the cannonading was renewed with the utmost vigor , until 5 o'clock .

		We had two men only wounded ; one of them , as said , mortally .

		By sunset last evening there were at the place of action , eight hundred , some say one thousand men , well armed .

		The inhabitants are moving their effects out of this town , with the greatest diligence .

		We shall not want men for our defence ; but as we have no stock of powder , can not use the cannon we have , but shall do the best we can with musketry , if attacked .

		Last week arrived Capt.
Nichols	PERSON	of
Providence	LOCATION	, with about seven tons powder , that he landed at
Norwich	LOCATION	, and it went by land , about Friday , to
Providence	LOCATION	... Your most obedient
G. Saltonstall	PERSON	.

		`` EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM NEW-LONDON , AUGUST 31 -LSB- 1775 -RSB- '' 1 Yesterday morning at six o'clock , we were alarmed by a severe firing to the eastward of this harbour , and in a little time an express arrived from
Stonington	LOCATION	-LRB- a small town about twelve miles distant -RRB- informing , that a tender had pursued two small sloops into that harbour , who ran on shore , and the people landed before the tender was in gun shot ; and as soon as she got in , they fired a full broadside into the town , tacked , and went out ; and in a little time returned with two more tenders and his Majesty 's ship the Rose : The ship came to anchor and brought her side to bear against the town , and began to fire ; the tenders also , who kept under sail , and both ship and sloops continued -LRB- without intermission -RRB- firing the whole day , and by express -LRB- which has since arrived -RRB- they have killed two of our men .

		There is now numbers of our people collected and are there ; and when the tender came within musket shot we fired on them : One tender got on the ground , and in carrying out a hawser our people imagined they killed several in the boat .

		There has been a flag sent off on board the Rose to know the reason of this extra work .

		The Captain says our people fired on his tender first , and that he will blow the town down .

		This morning is a cessation of firing ー hope the matter is settled .

		ACCOUNT OF ATTACK ON NEW
LONDON	LOCATION	BY H.M.S. ROSE 1 Wednesday morning -LSB- August 30 -RSB- a tender chased two small sloops into
Stonington	LOCATION	harbor , who had a number of people on board bound to Block-Island .

		they had but just time to get on shore before the tender came in , and after making a tack came close along side of Captain
Denison 's Wharf	ORGANIZATION	, and discharged a full broad side into the stores and houses and sailing out again , in a little time returned with the Rose man of war and another tender , And soon as the
Rose	PERSON	could get her broadside to bare on the town she began a very heavy fire , also the tenders , who were under sail , and continued firing the whole day , with very little intermission ; during the time a flag was sent off from the shore , desiring Capt.
Wallace	PERSON	, commander of the
Rose	PERSON	, to let them know what he meant by firing on the town ?

		His answer was , that he did it in his own defence .

		We have one man mortally wounded , and the houses , stores , & c. very much shattered .

		Yesterday morning -LSB- August 31 -RSB- they sailed out and anchored at the north-side of the west-end of
Fisher 's Island	LOCATION	, where they remain at this publication .

		There were five or six people killed on board the tenders , by the inhabitants who assembled and were under arms the whole day .

		They have carried off a schooner loaded with molasses , belonging to Patuxet , in
Providence	LOCATION	, from the West-Indies , and the two small sloops that landed the people .

Baker	PERSON	of the unenlisted

Flint	LOCATION	, received a Shot in his Forehead , and instantly expired ー Upon which his
Party	ORGANIZATION	returned the Fire and unfortunately killed two of the Indians .

NEW YORK	LOCATION	JOURNAL , THURSDAY , AUGUST 31 , 1775
New York	LOCATION	, August 31 .

		We hear from
Providence	LOCATION	, that on Tuesday the 22d instant his Majesty 's ships the Rose ,
Swan	PERSON	and
Glasgow	LOCATION	, attempted to go to
Providence	LOCATION	, and got within 8 miles of the town , when two of them ran ashore and the other came to an anchor .

		Soon after arrived a brig and a sloop inward bound from the West-Indies , these were immediately chased by the men of war 's barges and 3 cutters , till they ran ashore at
Warwick	LOCATION	, where they were boarded by the man of war 's men in sight of a great number of people who had assembled on the shore .

		There were in the harbour 2 armed schooners fitted out by the town of
Providence	LOCATION	for the protection of their trade , and were going to convoy a small fleet down the river .

		A smart engagement then began and lasted 3 hours and an half , during which , an incessant fire was kept up between the 2 schooners and the brig and sloop , which the people on board often attempted to get off , but as often were driven from the windlasses .

		But at last they cut the brig 's cable and carried her off , with the Captain on board , who refused to quit her ; the sloop we retook and brought into the harbour , tho ' fired upon by the man of war as we passed them .

		We had not a man killed or wounded , which is surprising .

		Upwards of 30 cannon ball were picked up on the shore .

		It is supposed many of the enemy are killed .

		The men of war are at present in
Bristol	LOCATION	harbour , where they have begun to rob and plunder the plantation of Mr.
William Wessels	PERSON	.

Philadelphia	LOCATION	, that last Week a Shallop laden with Coffee , taken from another Vessel that has escaped , also a Schooner from

New York	LOCATION	-RSB- August 31st , 1775 .

		This morning I have seen a printed resolution of the Honourable Board , dated the 29th instant , by which I am permitted in future -LRB- agreeably to former directions -RRB- to supply His Majesty 's ships on this station `` with all necessaries , as well fresh as salt , and that such supplies be sent by me to the Governor 's island , to be taken from thence on board of the said ships . ''

		In pursuance of which , I propose to write a letter to Capt.
-LSB- George -RSB- Vandeput	PERSON	, informing him of the leave given by the Honourable Board .

		But as the beer and water for the King 's ships have been supplied from
Brookland	LOCATION	ferry and not from this city ; as these articles are put on board of the ships in large heavy butts , which require a number of hands to hoist them in and out of the boats , and can not be obtained any where else with the same ease and convenience ; and as the inhabitants at the ferry have no objection to the man of war 's boat coming there to take off those articles , I humbly pray the honourable
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will be pleased -LRB- prior to my writing Capt.
Vandeput	PERSON	-RRB- to signify their opinion whether the man of war 's boats permitted to go to the ferry for beer and water , and whether I may assure him they will not be molested and hurt in going on that business .

		I hope I may be permitted to add , that if this liberty is not granted , it will be a difficult matter for the ships to water , as they can not get it on the Governor 's island ; nor do I conceive how it will be in my power to supply them with beer in any other mode .

		I have the honour , with all due deference to your superior judgments , to be , gentlemen -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		1775 .

		Notwithstanding the Rebels Attack upon the King 's Troops on the 19th of April and their subsequent behaviour would I think have fully justified my exerting the whole force of His Majesty 's
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under my Command against the
New England Provinces	LOCATION	several Months ago ; Yet I have hitherto forebore , hoping this unhappy People would either have returned to their Duty , or that before this time the final determination of
Great Britain	LOCATION	Concerning them would have been known : But after the repeated Insults and
Losses His Majesty 's Squadron	ORGANIZATION	has sustained by part of it being burnt and taken ; the King 's People killed and made Prisoners ; Light Houses destroyed ;
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	interrupted , And the Preparations for War daily making in the different Towns , I can no longer delay using the Means in my power to prevent the progress of such Rebellious and Pyratical Transactions .

		With your Excellency 's approbation and Assistance , I purpose to lay Waste such
Sea Port Towns	LOCATION	in the
New England	LOCATION	Governments as are not likely to be useful to His Majesty 's Stores and to destroy all the Vessels within the Harbours .

		To this End I must beg your Excellency to assist me with such Men , Vessels ,
Artillery Forces &	ORGANIZATION	ca as His Majesty 's Squadron is not provided with , and are really requisite for the intended Service .

		A
Party of Soldiers	ORGANIZATION	under the Command of a steady , experienced Officer , would almost ensure success to the Expedition and I submit to your Excellency 's better Judgment how many will answer the purpose .

		A small detachment from the Artillery will also be necessary under the Command of a Subaltern whom I should be glad to name .

		It may be proper to mention that the Symmetry and Spitfire require some small fitting to receive Howitzers and Mortar , Carriages for the Howitzers are also wanting .

		And as I have no person in the fleet who can do that sort of Work , I must beg the
Artillery and Transport Carpenters	ORGANIZATION	may assist those of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under the direction of Mr
Austin	PERSON	the Artillery Master Carpenter .

		But not to trouble your Excellency with too many applications on this business , I enclose a particular Account of every thing that I believe we shall have occasion to ask for ; and , satisfied of your readiness to Co-operate with and assist me on all occasions for this Majestys Service , It will give Me great pleasure If your Excellency approving my proposal , is pleased to order the required Supplies to be furnished with as much dispatch as possible I have the honor to be with great regard and Esteem Sir -LSB- & c. -RSB-

		NARRATIVE OF VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 -LSB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- 1775 Sept 1 The Admiral was impatient to revenge the Insults shown his Cruizers , and to scourge the Inhabitants of these
Sea Port Towns	LOCATION	where they had suffered and also of those places from whence the Privateers , which then and afterwards did so much mischief to our Transports and Tenders , were continually popping out as soon as a Merchant Ship appeared off : Therefore if the Expedition now proposed to the General by letter and to which he at Length gave way , could have earlier taken effect , with Troops sufficient , much Loss to his Majesty would have been prevented , and very possibly the Coast of the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	kept in as great Awe , that they would scarcely have suffered any Privateers to have taken shelter amongst them .

		It was by the Admirals allowing Captain
-LSB- James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	to keep on board the Rose a party of 37 Marines above his Complement , besides many supernumerary Seamen in his own and the other Ships and Vessels with him , that he was enabled to arm Vessels suited to the Navigation of the small Rivers and Creeks , and whenever occasion required to land a hundred men and upwards and ravage the coast ; that he kept his Post at
Rhode Island	LOCATION	in spite of the Enemy , and not only prevented the Privateers of force actually fitted out at
Providence	LOCATION	from getting to Sea , but compelled the
Congress of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	2 to consent to his little Squadron being supplied with fresh Provisions , in order to save the Towns and People on the Sea Coast from Destruction ; and no Doubt hindered Numbers of small Privateers from being equipped in that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		Could the other Ships of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	have been well supplied with Musquetry , what might not have been done ?

		But the Admiralty 's Orders to land the
Marines	ORGANIZATION	, the very low Complements to , and the Condition of the few Ships with the Admiral , effectually tied up his hands from either thoroughly protecting our own Trade , or harrassing the Enemy by Descents .

		The
Halifax	LOCATION	new armed
Schooner	ORGANIZATION	arrived from
Halifax	LOCATION	with a Convoy of Transports , and brought the Admiral Letters from Governor
-LSB- Francis -RSB- Legge	PERSON	, Captain -LSB-
Edward -RSB- Medows	PERSON	of the Tartar , and Captain -LSB-
William -RSB- Dudingston	PERSON	of the
Senegal	LOCATION	.

		It seems the Province was much alarmed with Reports of Pyrates in the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, and the Governor by the advice of his
Council	ORGANIZATION	applied to Capt.
Medows	PERSON	to sail with all the Kings Ships and Vessels then in the
Harbour	LOCATION	to the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, but Captain
Medows	PERSON	acquainted the Governor that as all the Province Arms were put on board Vessels in
Halifax Harbour	LOCATION	under his Protection , he thought the most essential service the Tartar could do would be to remain there ; and that he would send the
Senegal	LOCATION	to the
Bay of Fundy	LOCATION	, which , with the two armed Schooners at that time there , he was certain would be sufficient at present for the protection of our Trade , and the Western parts of the Province , the Rebels not being yet in a Condition to attempt any thing considerable ; And he was sure the Admiral would provide for the Security of the whole Province ... .

		Captain
Dudingstone	PERSON	sent the Schooner on with them 3 to
Boston	LOCATION	, and went himself into the Bay to collect all the Vessels bound with Cattle and Forage to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		And the Admiral himself wrote shortly afterwards to
Govr Legge	PERSON	on the subject of his letter .

JONATHAN JENKINS	PERSON	TO DR.
NATHANIEL FREEMAN	PERSON	1 Sr. Nantucket 1 Sept 1775 I use the freedom from the former acquaintance I had with your Person , to request the favr of a correspondance by Letters , if the present difficulties have not taken up yr attention so far as to disable you to comply as being upon an Island have Not an Oppy of geting the right of any Story , & you being placed in such a Station as to be knowing to all that transpires ; so various are the accots .

		we have here , that there is no knowing which is right , we have heard that it past a Resolve , that no provision should be brought to this Island & that all communication was to be stopt .

		I understand that they censor us as Tory upon the Main , & charge us with supplying
Tom Gage	PERSON	with Provisions , it is all fals , there has never been any kind of Provision whatsoever gone from here to
Boston	LOCATION	, except three Barrels of Flour which
Wm Rotch	ORGANIZATION	sent as a present to three Widow ; which he sent the time that Capt Richd Coffin went down to bring
Geyer & Burgess	ORGANIZATION	's Ship that was carried there by a King Ship .

		I must acknowledge that our leading Men , have been very backward in not vindicating the Charrecter of the Island , but let so many false storys pass about & not take notice of it As to the inhabitance here being Tory , they are not , but as well wishers to the Cause contending , as any sett of People whersoever , but the Situation of this Island is Such as will not admit of our doing anything except we pack up our all & abandon it , we are no way capiable of defending ourselves , from even an Arm Schooner with twenty Soldiers on board , did we not make it evident to Capt -LSB-
Joshua -RSB- Davis	PERSON	when he came on here for Whale boat with his Hundred Men ?

		you have never ask 'd Men of us , when ever men are Necessary from this Island , I doubt not but we shall be able to turn out a Hundred or More of as good Marksmen as any of the Rifle Men & men who wants not for courrage .

		It very much surprisd me to hear that that half Starv 'd -LSB- torn -RSB- the best times
Baree River	LOCATION	should resolve at their Town Meeting Not to Supply us with any of the Necessarys of Life , they never had one tenth part of provision enough to subsist on among themselves , but carried from here the Chief of their support , without us they would all Starve in a heap , since their Resolves there people has been obligd to bring over here all the Cash they could muster to purchase beef Pork flour & c. which they us 'd to get by bringing over

JOSEPH STANTON	PERSON	, JR. , TO DEPUTY GOVERNOR
NICHOLAS COOKE	PERSON	1 Sir ,
Charlestown	LOCATION	, 1st Sept. 1775 I have been obliged to take the Town 's Stocks of powder and ball from
Westerly	LOCATION	,
Charlestown	LOCATION	and
Hopkintown	LOCATION	, to equip the troops for the
Block Island	LOCATION	expedition , and to press 50 fire-arms .

		Of consequence , we are left in a most defenceless and wretched situation .

		These are , therefore , to beg your Honor would immediately order that the above towns may be supplied , as numbers of the inhabitants are much displeased with me for taking their powder , ball and arms , at a time when our most inveterate enemies are on every side insulting of us .

		Capt.
-LSB- James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	, with three tenders , gave chase in pursuit of two of our transports , with 75 men , who were on their passage to
Block Island	LOCATION	.

		The night coming on when they were in the middle of the Sound , and about a league distance from the Rose and tender , gave our troops an opportunity to make their escape .

		The transports landed their men , and returned to the harbour the same night .

		In the morning the ship Rose and her tenders came into the above harbour , -LSB- and -RSB- began a heavy fire on the town , which continued most of the day .

		The women and children abandoned the town , in the midst of a severe rain storm .

		It is surprising that we had only one man wounded .

		The tenders stretched off and on within 60 yards of the wharves , and received the fire of our musketry , from behind the wharves , stores and rocks .

		We have reason to believe we killed number of the enemy .

		300 of Col.
-LSB- Charles -RSB- Webb	PERSON	's regiment , who were stationed at
New London	LOCATION	, arrived in the evening with great numbers of the inhabitants , who behaved with great intrepedity , and even the women were rather mad than surprised .

		The houses received some damage from the Rose , but none from the tenders .

		2 Col.
Rhodes	PERSON	is on the
Island	LOCATION	with 180 troops .

		The remainder will embark in small boats , as we think it most safe , immediately .

		We have not a sufficient supply of powder for the Island expedition .

		should be glad of a few casks .

Time	ORGANIZATION	to get on shore , before the Tender came in , and after making a Tack they came close along side of Capt.

Time	ORGANIZATION	returned with the Rose Man of War and another Tender , and as soon as the
Rose	PERSON	could get her broadside to bear on the Town , she began a very heavy fire , also the Tenders who were under sail ; during the
Time	ORGANIZATION	a flag was sent off from the shore , desiring Captain -LSB-
James -RSB- Wallace	PERSON	, commander of the
Rose	PERSON	, to let them know what he meant by firing on the Town ?

		GEORGE
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	TO BRIGADIER GENERAL
DAVID WOOSTER	PERSON	1 Sir Camp at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, September 2 , 1775 .

		I have just received your Favour of the 29th Ult .

		by express .

		I am very sensible that the Situation of the Inhabitants of
Long-Island	LOCATION	, as well as of all those on the
Coast	LOCATION	, exposes them greatly to the Ravages of the Enemy , and it is to be wished general Protection could be extended to them , consistent with the Prosecution of those great Plans , which have been adopted for the common Safety .

		This was early foreseen and the Danger provided for by a Resolution of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, That each Province should depend on it 's own internal Strength against these Incursions , the Prejudice arising from them , even if successful , not being equal to that of separating the
Army	ORGANIZATION	into a Number of small Detachments , who would be harrassed in fruitless Marches and Counter-Marches , after an Enemy , whose Conveyance by
Shipping	ORGANIZATION	is so advantageous that they might keep the whole Coast in constant Alarm , without our being able perhaps at any Time , to give them vigorous Opposition .

		Upon this Principle I have invariably rejected every Application made me here , to keep any Detachments on the Coast for these Purposes .

		I should , therefore most probably have thought it my Duty , to have ordered the three Companies mentioned in your Letter to have joined your
Army	ORGANIZATION	, to act in the general Service , had they not been under Command from General
Schuyler	PERSON	to join him , but as it is I can by no Means interfere .

		He is engaged in a Service of the greatest Importance to the whole Continent , his Strength and appointments far short of his Expectations , and to give any counter Orders may not only defeat his whole Plan ; but must make me responsible to the Public for the Failure .

		Instead , therefore , of their further Stay , I would have them march immediately .

		I fear the
Delay of the ten Days	PERSON	may have very bad Effects , as by my last Advices from
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, General
Schuyler	PERSON	was to march in a few Days for
Canada	LOCATION	; and it is highly probable he may depend upon these Companies to occupy the Posts of Communication , which otherwise he must weaken his
Army	ORGANIZATION	to do .

		No provincial
Congress	ORGANIZATION	can with any Propriety , interfere in the Disposition of Troops on the continental Establishment , much less controul the Orders of any General Officer , so that in this Instance the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
New York	LOCATION	have judged properly , in declining to counteract General
Schuyler	PERSON	's Orders .

		I wish I could extend my Approbation equally to the whole Line of their Conduct .

		Before you receive this Letter , you will most probably be able to judge how far your Continuance on Long-Island will be farther necessary .

		If the Fleet which last sailed was destined for those Coasts , it must be arrived .

		If it is not , it is certainly gone to the Eastward , and your present Station is no longer necessary .

		The Importance of preserving the Communication of the
North River	LOCATION	and many other Reasons induce me to wish you were returned to your former
Post	ORGANIZATION	.

		The late Transactions at
New York	LOCATION	, furnish additional Reasons for your being as near that City , as is consistent with the Discipline and Convenience of your Troops .

		Your next , therefore , I flatter myself will inform me of your having resumed your former Station .

		I am , Sir , etc. 1 .

BENJAMIN HALLOWELL	PERSON	TO GENERAL
THOMAS GAGE	PERSON	1 Sir
Boston	LOCATION	the 2d September 1775 I am very sorry to be under the necessity of troubling your Excellency again upon the subject of the late transaction between Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	and my self , being sensable how much your attention must be engrossed by subjects of greater moment and concern to the public , but consiquences that have resulted from that affair render it altogether unavoidable .

		I must therefore beg leave to mention the insults that I have met with last night from Lieutenants
Thomas	PERSON	, and
Samuel Graves	PERSON	, Nephews to the Admiral , and to represent to your Excellency my present precarious situation .

		I have already taken the liberty to acquaint your Excellency that I had received two different challanges from
Leiutenant Thomas Graves	PERSON	in consequence of what had passed between the Admiral and myself .

		Having some business to transact late yesterday in the afternoon relative to the King 's service in the Revenue department , at
Rowes	LOCATION	wharfe , I perceived that Mr
Thomas Graves	PERSON	accompany 'd by the Boatswain of His Majestys Ship
Preston	PERSON	, with two or three other decently dressed persons , and Several Sailors had posted themselves in such a manner as to prevent my return ,
Mr Graves	PERSON	besides his Sword had a large bludgeon in his hand and some of the others had sticks ー As I approached towards them Mr
Graves	PERSON	advanced Several paces , and desired to know why I had not met him in consiquence of the messages he had sent me , that he wished to speak with me on the same business , and desired me to retire with him to the next wharfe , Where the vessel laid which he now commands , I told him that having no dispute with him , I had nothing to say to him upon the subject of the controversy between the Admiral and me ー he then began to insult me with abusive language , I expostulated with him upon the impropriety of his Conduct in taking any part in that affair , intimating that I had been ill used by the Admiral , and that he was the only person I was answerable to , adding that the Admiral was fully able to do himself justice without the aid of any other person , and that I was greatly surprised to find him accompanyYd by so many people , with an apparent intent as I conceived to do me an injury ー After some farther altercation between us in the course of which I told him very freely my opinion of the part he had taken , ー and upon the master of the
Custom	ORGANIZATION	house schooner , remonstrating with him upon his indecent and ungentleman like conduct , he thought proper to withdraw towards his Vessel with his adherents .

		Returning into town in my way to Mr
Barch	ORGANIZATION	's in company with Mr
George Leonard	PERSON	, I was met in
Cornhill	LOCATION	near the bottom of School street , by
Leiutenant Samuel Graves	PERSON	, who passed me with a lowering look , and without speaking or the appearance of an intention to do me mischief , came behind me , and struck me a violent blow on the back part of my head , with a bludgeon which he had in his hand ー the , blow for a time stunned me and deprived me of the power of an immediate reply ー I recovered soon , and found him drawing his Sword , and retreating as I advanced .

		Being unarmed , I reproached him with his cowardly behavour , and desired him to throw aside his Sword , asking him the cause of his ruffian treatment , ー he said it was because I had insulted the Commander in Chief of the Squadron .

		ー The high
Sherriff	PERSON	and others coming up and interposing , ー we were parted , ー but not without an apparent disapprobation and indignation at his conduct by all the standers by , both military & civil , and this morning I received a Challange from him by a lieutenant of the
Preston	PERSON	.

		Your Excellency will now perceive the precarious situation and predicament in which I am involved by making a demand of my own property , for expostulating with Admiral
Graves	PERSON	on his oppression , I received a blow for returning that blow , I have been way laid ー abused ー struck and challenged by his Nephews , and what is to follow , is yet to be discovered .

		I am not at liberty to suppose that a Gentleman of Admiral Graves high rank cou 'd have any knowledge or participation in such mean and infamous attempts upon my life .

		If he shou 'd feel himself injured from any thing that has passed between us he knows well how to do himself justice , at a proper Season , And I shou 'd think that he must also feel and resent the outrage offered by others in his defence .

		To your Excellency I appeal for the Justice of my cause , not doubting but you will take such measures , as may in their operation procure me ample reperation for the unmerited abuse and ill treatment I have received , and protection from any farther attacks from ruffians .

		I am Sir -LSB- & . -RSB-

New London	LOCATION	in the way they woud undoubtedly go : ー & not so far Distant but that they might afford timely assistance & Serve

GEORGE JAMES BRUERE	PERSON	, GOVERNOR OF
BERMUDA	LOCATION	, TO LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	1 No 23 Bermuda 2d of Septemr .

		1775 My Lord My former letters will inform your Lordship of the Powder Magazine being broke into , and most Violently , and audaciously forced open , in the night of the 14th of August , when most of the Gentlemen of the assembly were come to Town , agreeable to the last Adjournment .

		The above Villanous Scheme was Effected when least expected .

		I have repeatedly Represented the Necessity and want of some Soldiers here , or a Sloop of War , but never expected that I should have so great Cause of Complaint as the above mentioned most Villanous Crime hath now Shewn .

		The Civil officers of Government here , are very few , and those generally put in to office without any Recommendation from the Governor , and are dispersed in the Country .

		Many People here practice a most Scandalous Calling and that is , by taking their Vessels Yearly & Constantly under pretence of going to
Turks Islands	LOCATION	for Salt , they go to a place they call the Cacoses , or a bunch of small
Islands	LOCATION	, Rocks or
Sandy Banks	PERSON	, and there lye for months , upon the Watch for Ships or Vessels of any Nation , that may have the Misfortune to be cast on the Banks and Rocks there ; when they themselves by Constant Practice , and use to the place , are so good Pilots as to escape all danger themselves .

		This practice must of course make the People , and their Negrqes that use it , most ferocious and Accustome their Negroes to plunder , and to be public , as well as private thieves .

		And Your Lordship must remember , how I reported the -LSB- y -RSB- had Pumps and Rigging of a fine Ship from
Ireland	LOCATION	Cutt away and Carried off , and the Hulk of the Ship being gott off , and towed into
Harbour	LOCATION	is now sold and Repairing .

		2 If they have no Success at the
Cacoses	LOCATION	, by that Scandalous practice , they go to
Turks Islands	LOCATION	, take in some Salt and Passengers , and return home And such as do not follow this practice , go to the
West Indies	LOCATION	, from
Island	LOCATION	to
Island	LOCATION	, Searching for freight and visit all the
Islands	LOCATION	, belonging to foreign Powers , such as
St. Eustatious	LOCATION	,
Curaco	LOCATION	,
Senta Cruz	PERSON	,
St Thomas	PERSON	& c & c. Their Sloops or Brigantines crew are generally as follows .

		The Person that may be Part owner for a Captain or rather Director , the Mate doing the Duty as Captain , or rather Swearing Master , the rest all Negroes then in Case any thing of Contraband Goods is to be taken in , or discharged , the Swearing Captain may step aside , and the Negroes and their leader Complete the Business .

		And by this practice of imploying a Number of
Negroes Great Britain	LOCATION	loseth the Nursery of White Sailors and their Ma1 Practices are easily carried on .

		Besides the Carpenters , Masons , Blacksmiths , and Ship Carpenters are almost all Negroes .

		And the White People presume to be Gentlemen .

		I shall likewise Recommend to His Majesty once more that it is as necessary that there should be one company of Soldiers quartered at the
West	LOCATION	end of these
Islands	LOCATION	, in Barracks Seperate from the People , and another Company at the East end , distributed in the Castle , fort and fortifications here , and likewise the frigates of War passing and repassing , to and from the
West Indies	LOCATION	, to Call as oportunity may offer which they may do with the greatest Safety , if our Pilots will look out for their arrival properly .

		And Sir
Richard Bickerton	PERSON	can give Your Lordship farther information if You please to Shew Him this letter , in respect to the Situation or Navigation to
Bermuda	LOCATION	.

		My Lord since Delegates have been chose here , and the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Philadelphia Petitioned	ORGANIZATION	under pretence that they might want Provisions , notwithstanding they had at that time more than they could either purchase or consume in Six or 8 Months , it is much to be feared , that the Inhabitants either of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	or
South Carolina	LOCATION	, might be encouraged to come here , and taken the Powder , and leave Bread , flour , or Rice in lieu .

		Since these Delegates have been Appointed , at first at the Sudden Instigation of a few , there seems to be but very few friends to Government .

		And our Sloops may be imployed against His Majestys Troops , or good Subjects next , or the Cannon taken away .

		I do n't as yet know how I shall get this letter Conveyed to Your Lordship , as they have prevented any Person from hiring or chartering their Vessel to Me , either to send to
Boston	LOCATION	or anywhere else .

		I am in very great Grief and Anxiety My Lord , for in the
Rebels News	ORGANIZATION	papers , altho ' very erroneous , and many falsehoods in them , both my Sons , very promising Youths , are
Said	PERSON	to be Killed , and I know nothing to the Contrary .

Hessom	ORGANIZATION	arrived here this Morng and I now redispatch him with Answers to such Parts of the Letters you have sent me , as require Measures to be immediately taken upon them .

		Sir H -LSB- ugh -RSB- Palliser & I are of Opinion that in consequence of Adml -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	's Wish to have more Boats , the
Navy Board	ORGANIZATION	should be directed to supply each Ship for
America	LOCATION	with a Cutter on -LSB- or -RSB- Yawl above the Established Number ; and to send 20 Cutters by the first Transports that go to
America	LOCATION	, to be delivered to the Storekeeper at
Boston	LOCATION	, to be disposed of as Adml Graves shall direct .

		Also to prepare an additional Assortment of Stores to be immediately sent to
Halifax	LOCATION	, suitable to the Ships employed in
America	LOCATION	.

		Admiral
Graves	PERSON	should be told that his Idea of putting additional Marines into the Schooners & Small Vessels , is in our Opinion very proper ; but as that we have none to spare as yet from hence , he must lend them from the Compliments of the Ships now with him , and he may depend upon it , that all the Ships that are coming out to him shall bring as many supernumerary Marines as we can possibly get ; but he should at the same time be told , that he must not break into the Marine Battallions on Shore .

		As
Adml Graves	PERSON	mentions his Wish to have some 50 Gunships , and gives very substantial Reasons in my Opinion for such a Requisition , 2 which it is hoped would enable him to send home the three Guard ships , which should not be withdrawn from the defence of this Country but in a Case of Necessity ; we think it advisable that the Experiment a small 50 Gunship , & the
Phoenix & Roebuck	ORGANIZATION	of 44 Guns -LRB- which will answer the same purpose -RRB- be immediately commissioned ; but upon this point you will ask Lord
Dartmouth	PERSON	, to whom I have now written , & to whom you will communicate everything in this Letter that relates to
America	LOCATION	, whether he approves of this additional Reinforcement , before you lay the Commissions before the Admiralty , and send the proper Orders to the

Kew	LOCATION	, 1st July 1775 .

		Lord Sandwich ー Your letter accompanying those received from
Major Pitcairn	LOCATION	is just arrived : that officer 's conduct seems highly praiseworthy .

		I am of his opinion that when once those rebels have felt a smart blow , they will submit ; and no situation can ever change my fixed resolution , either to bring the colonies to a due obedience to the legislature of the mother country or to cast them off !

		The admiral 's dispatches convince me that 50-gun ships would be more fit for that service than the larger ones : I have therefore proposed that the three guardships should be recalled , and the fleet in
America	LOCATION	strengthened by fitting out six ships of fifty guns .

		I have observed to Lord North that this equipment will require the raising all the men necessary to man those ships , for that you can not from any of the ships in commission furnish a single man .

		1775 My Lords The King having received Advices that not only the 4
New England	LOCATION	Governments are in open and actual Rebellion , & that the People have been daring enough , amongst other Acts of Hostility to make Seizures of several Vessels , and to send the Crews to Prison , but also that the Flame has extended itself to most of the other Colonies , in which the greatest Violences have been committed , the
Constitutional Authority of Government	ORGANIZATION	trampled upon , & the People armed & arrayed with an avowed Intention of Resistance by force to the Measures His Majesty has ordered to be pursued for restoring the public Peace and for protecting the Commerce of His Subjects , it is His Majesty 's firm Resolution of which I am directed to acquaint your Lordships , that every measure be pursued for suppressing , by the most vigorous Efforts , by Sea and Land , this unnatural Rebellion which menaces the Subversion of the present happy Constitution .

		To this end it is His Majesty 's Pleasure that the Admiral commanding upon the
Boston Station	LOCATION	, do carry on such Operations upon the Sea Coasts of the 4 Governments in
New England	LOCATION	as he shall judge most effectual for suppressing in Conjunction with His Majesty 's Land Forces , the Rebellion which is now openly avowed and supported in those Colonies , and that he do seize and detain , untill His Majesty 's pleasure be known , all Ships & Vessels belonging to the Inhabitants of those Colonies , such only excepted as he shall find upon good Evidence and Information to be bona fide the sole property of persons who have been in no shape concerned in the Rebellious Proceedings within those Colonies and have given Proof of their attachment to the Constitution by refusing to concur in the unwarrantable Measures which have been adopted to subvert it.ー It is His Majesty 's further pleasure that the utmost Expedition should be used for sending out the four Frigates now preparing in Consequence of my Letter to your Lordships of the 17 Ulto & that Vice Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	be instructed to make such a disposition of his Fleet as that , without crippling the Force necessary for the Service upon the Station where he commands in Person , a small detached Squadron under the Command of an able and discreet Officer , may be stationed at each of the following places Vizt at
New York	LOCATION	, in
Delawar Bay	LOCATION	, in

Conveyance of Arms & Ammunition	ORGANIZATION	or military Stores of any kind.ー It is His Majesty 's further pleasure that the Commanders of those detached Squadrons should be instructed to receive on board His Majesty 's Ships and to afford every reasonable accommodation to the Governors , or other Officers of the Colonies within their respective Stations who may be compelled by the Violence of the People to seek such an Asylum , and generally to afford every protection in their Power to any of His Majesty 's Subjects who may require it , and further that the said Commanders do cause it to be publickly signified in all such Sea port Towns as are accessible to the King 's Ships , that if any Violences shall hereafter be offered therein to any Officers of the Crown , or other peaceably disposed Subjects to His Majesty or if any Bodies of Men shall be raised and armed in the said Towns , or any Military works erected , otherwise than by order of His Majesty , or those acting under
His Majesty 's Authority	ORGANIZATION	, or if any attempts shall be made to seize or destroy any public Magazines of Arms , Ammunition , or other Stores , it will be the Duty of such Commander to proceed by the most vigorous Efforts , against the said Town , as in open Rebellion against the King ; and it is His Majesty 's Pleasure , that the Commander of each
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	be further instructed , that if , after such Signification , any Town shall persist in the rebellious Acts above stated , he do proceed accordingly .

		What further may be necessary must depend upon the Activity and Discretion of the Admiral , and of the Commanders of His Majesty 's Ships in Events as they shall arise , And I have only to add that it is His Majesty 's Pleasure that Your Lordships do lose no time in transmitting to Vice Admiral Graves such Instructions as shall correspond with the Directions contained in this Letter , giving him ground to expect that a further Augmentation , over and above the four Frgates , will be sent to him as soon as His Majesty 's Service will permit .

JOHN POWNALL	PERSON	TO
PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Greenwich July 2d 1775 .

		The Augmentation of Vice Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	's Squadron by an Addition of 50 Gun Ships as he proposes & which I see Lord
Sandwich	PERSON	approves , corresponds exactly with the Wishes of the rest of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Servants , and Lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	would have received The King 's Pleasure upon it , with the other Matters contained in his Letter to the Lords of the Admiralty of yesterday 's date , but that both he and Lord
North	PERSON	did not think it proper to give such Orders without first consulting Lord
Sandwich	PERSON	; His Lordship 's Letter to you decides upon the Matter , and Lord
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	directs me to say he entirely approves what Lord
Sandwich	PERSON	proposes and will take The
King	ORGANIZATION	's Pleasure for the necessary Orders as soon as possible ; In the mean time you will perhaps think it adviseable to press forward the Preparation .

DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	TO

Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	5th July 1775 ... it is the King 's firm Resolution that the most vigorous efforts should be made both by Sea and Land to reduce his rebellious subjects to obedience and the proper measures are now pursuing not only for augmenting the army under General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	but also for making such additions to our Naval Strength in
North America	LOCATION	as may enable Admiral -LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	to make such a disposition of his Fleet as that besides the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	necessary for the
New England Station	LOCATION	there may be separate Squadrons at
New York	LOCATION	within the
Bay of Delaware	LOCATION	, in
Chesapeake Bay	LOCATION	and upon the
Coast of Carolina	ORGANIZATION	.

		After what has passed there can be no doubt what ought to be the Plan of Operations for the Squadron upon the
New England Station	ORGANIZATION	, and I think it necessary to acquaint you , for your own information , that Admiral
Graves	PERSON	will be instructed to exert the most vigorous efforts , for suppressing the Rebellion now Openly avowed & supported in that Country and to seize & detain all ships and Vessels belonging to the Inhabitants thereof , such only excepted as are the property of Persons who are friends of Government & have shewn an attachment to the Constitution .

		There is still some room to hope that the Colonies to the Southward may not proceed to the same lengths with those of
New England	LOCATION	, it is however His Majesty 's intentions that the Commanders of the separate Squadrons I have mentioned should be instructed to prevent all Commerce between the Colonies within their respective stations and any other places than
Great Britain Ireland	LOCATION	and
His Majestys Islands	LOCATION	in the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		That they should receive on Board and give protection to any officers of the Crown who may be compelled by the violence of the People to seek for such an Asylum and to proceed as in the Case of a Town in actual Rebellion against such of the sea port Towns being accessible to the Kings Ships , as shall hereafter offer any violence to the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	officers or in which any Troops shall be raised or military works erected , other than by His Majestys authority , or any attempts made to seize or plunder any public Magazine of Arms or Ammunition 1 .

ROBERT EDEN	LOCATION	, GOVERNOR OF

Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	July 5th 1775 .

		Sir .

		Your brother 3 has been so obliging as to communicate to me from time to time , such Intelligence as you have transmitted to him respecting the State of affairs in
Maryland	LOCATION	, and about 10 days ago I had the Satisfaction to receive your Letter of the 5th .

		of May .

		I sincerely wish you may not have been too sanguine in your hopes that the time is not far distant when Peace & Harmony will be restored , and Confidence re-established on a permanent Basis ; At the same time I observe with Satisfaction , what you say of the Temper and Moderation of the Persons chosen to represent the Province of
Maryland	LOCATION	in the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, & I am not without some reason to believe that there may be others in that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the same Disposition .

		At present however , the rebellious proceedings of the people in most of the Colonies , wear the Appearance of an actual Revolt , & it is his Majesty 's firm Resolution , in consequence of the Advices which he has received , that the most vigorous Efforts shoud be made both by Sea and Land , to reduce his rebellious subjects to Obedience , and the proper Measures are now pursuing , not only for augmenting the
Army	ORGANIZATION	under General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	, but also for making such Addition to our Naval strength in No .


America	LOCATION	as may enable
Adml	PERSON	.

		-LSB-
Samuel -RSB- Graves	PERSON	to make such a Disposition of his Fleet as that , besides the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	necessary for the
New England Station	LOCATION	, there may be separate squadrons at
New York	LOCATION	, within the
Bay of Delawar	LOCATION	, in
Chesapeake Bay	LOCATION	, & upon the
Coast of Carolina	ORGANIZATION	.

		After what has passed there can be no doubt what ought to be the Plan of Operations for the Squadron upon the
New England Station	ORGANIZATION	, & I think it necessary to acquaint You , for your own Information , that Admiral
Graves	PERSON	will be instructed to exert the most vigorous Efforts for suppressing the Rebellion now openly avowed & supported in that Country , & to seize & detain all Ships & Vessels belonging to the Inhabitants thereof , such only excepted as are the property of persons who are friends of Government who have shewn an Attachment to the Constitution .

		There is still some room to hope that the Colonies to the Southward may not proceed to the same Lengths with those of
New England	LOCATION	: It is however , His Majesty 's Intentions that the Commanders of the separate squadrons I have mentioned should be instructed to prevent all Commerce between the Colonies within their respective Stations & any other places than
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, or his
Majesty 's Islands	LOCATION	in the
West Indies	LOCATION	; that they should receive on board ; and give Protection to any officers of the Crown who may be compelled by the Violence of the People , to seek for such an Asylum , & to proceed , as in case of a town in actual rebellion against such of the Seaport towns , being accessible to the
King	ORGANIZATION	's ships , as shall hereafter offer any violence to the King 's officers , or in which any troops shall be raised , or Military works erected , other than by his
Majesty 's Authority	ORGANIZATION	, or any Attempts made to seize or plunder any public Magazine of Arms or Ammunition .

		With regard to the Plan of operations to be adopted by General
Gage	PERSON	, it must depend upon his own Judgment , & the opinion of the able
Generals	ORGANIZATION	4 with him ; and I have only to add , that it is His Majesty 's express Command that you do exert every Endeavour , & employ every Means in your power to aid & support him & Admiral
Graves	PERSON	in all such operations as they may think proper to undertake for carrying the King 's Orders into full Execution , and restoring the
Authority of his Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's Government .

		The Attention you appear to have given to the Preservation of peace & good Order in your Government , is very much approved of by the King , and I have his Majesty 's Commands to assure You of his Royal Acquiescence in your wish to return to
England	LOCATION	when the State of Affairs in your Government will admit of it .

		In the mean time I hope your private Affairs here will not suffer by the very honourable Resolution you have taken of remaining in
Maryland	LOCATION	so long as the present Disorders continue .

		Your Lordship 's Conduct on this trying Occasion does you the greatest honor , but it is impossible to reflect upon the distress it has occasioned to
Lady Dunmore	PERSON	& the rest of your Family without very painfull feelings .

		The Madness of the
People of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	exceeds all bounds , & leaves no room for any other Consideration than that of the means of suppressing by the most vigorous efforts a Rebellion which -LRB- united as all
America	LOCATION	is against Us -RRB- threatens to overturn the Constitution .

		We have the Satisfaction to find that General -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	had , upon your Lordship 's Application , taken Steps for giving Your Lordship every Assistance which his Situation would afford .

		It is upon him alone that Your Lordship must now depend for any small body of Troops , but I have not failed to take the proper measures for sending you , by a Ship that will be ready in a few days 2000 Stand of Arms and Ammunition in proportion .

		I shall write more fully to Your Lordship by that Ship , in the mean time it is proper I should acquaint Your Lordship that it is the King 's firm Resolution that the most vigorous Efforts should be made , both by Sea and Land , to reduce his Rebellious Subjects to Obedience , & the proper measures are now pursuing , not only for augmenting the
Army	ORGANIZATION	under General

New England	LOCATION	Governments are in Arms , but that almost every other Colony has catched the flame , and a spirit of Rebellion has gone forth that menaces the subversion of the Constitution , it is the King 's firm resolution , that the most vigorous efforts should be made , both by sea and land to reduce his Rebellious Subjects to obedience , and the proper Measures are now pursuing not only for augmenting the

SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 By & ca The King having received Advices that not only the Four
New England	LOCATION	Governments are in open & actual Rebellion & that the People have been daring enough , amongst other Acts of Hostility , to make Seizures of several Vessels and to send the Crews to Prison , but also that the Flame has extended itself to most of the other Colonies , in which the greatest Violences have been committed , the
Constitutional Authority of Government	ORGANIZATION	trampled upon , and the People armed and arrayed with an avowed Intention of Resistance , by Force , to the Measures His Majesty has ordered to be pursued for restoring the Public Peace , and for protecting the Commerce of His Subjects ; And it being His Majesty 's firm Resolution that every measure be pursued for suppressing by the most vigorous Efforts by Sea & Land , this unnatural Rebellion , which menaces the subversion of the present happy Constitution ; You are therefore , in pursuance of His Majesty 's Pleasure signified to us by the

PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	TO VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 Sir -LSB-
Admiralty Office	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- 6th July 1775 Soon after I had dispatched to you by the Viper instead of the Raven Sloop , my Letter of the 24h .

		ultimo , I received by Lieutenant
Merrick	PERSON	and immediately communicated to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty your Letters of the 13th , 14th , 15th , 18th , 19th & 25th of May , giving an Account of the Rebellious Behaviour of His Majesty 's American Subjects in several of the Colonies and of your proceedings since the 23d of April , Copies of all which have been sent to the
Earl of Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	for His Majesty 's Information .

		Their Lordships approve of your hiring Advice Boats to carry Dispatches to the King 's Ships and Towns in the other Colonies as all communication by Land is stopt or at least very precarious .

		The reasons you have given for desiring to have a few of the old 50 Gun Ships sent out to you are very substantial and as their Lordships , think that the Experiment a 50 Gun Ship built upon a new principle and of less burthen than any which have been built these many Years , and the
Phoenix	LOCATION	and
Roebuck	PERSON	of 44 Guns , will answer the purpose to the full as well , and can be got ready much Sooner , they have ordered them to be fitted out and will send them to join you at
Boston	LOCATION	as soon as possible , which additional Reinforcement it is hoped will enable you to send home the three Guardships which should not but in a case of necessity be withdrawn from the defence of this Country ; But as I said in my last this is a point that is left to your discretion according as the necessity of the times and the Service may require , and of which their Lordships wish to have your opinion by the very first conveyance that offers .

		Their Lordships have in compliance with your request ordered the
Raven Sloop	ORGANIZATION	to be supplied with an additional Boat , and will give the like directions for all other Ships that are going to you , as well as for sending some spare Boats to you by all opportunities that offer .

		Your idea of putting small Detachments of Marines into the Schooners and small Vessels is in their Lordships opinion very proper ; but as they can not at present be spared from hence , Their Lordships recommend it to you to lend them from the Complements of the Ships now with you , and command me to acquaint you that you may depend upon receiving by every Ship coming out to you as many Supernumerary Marines as can possibly be got , which , from the number of Recruiting Parties that are now sent out , it is hoped will be sufficient to answer all your demands .

		But in all Events their Lordships command me to add you must not break into the Marine Battallions employed on shore .

		Their Lordships have directed the
Navy Board	ORGANIZATION	to send to
Halifax	LOCATION	immediately , such an assortment of Stores as may be necessary and proper for the use of the
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under your Command And as they do not think it safe to rely wholly upon the Contracts that have been made for supplying your
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	with Provisions they will direct the
Victualling Board	ORGANIZATION	to send out to you in due time a further supply of Provisions than those mentioned in my Letter of the 24th Ultimo .

		Their Lordships are satisfied with your having permitted Lieutenant
Merrick	PERSON	to quit the
Glasgow	LOCATION	for the recovery of his health , and have no objection to your giving Mr
Pultney	PERSON	a
Commission	ORGANIZATION	to be Lieutenant of her , in his room , who is now acting as such by your Order .

		I am & c P : S : -LRB- By the
Raven Sloop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- 1 .

		PRO , Admiralty 2/548 , 478 , NYHS Transcript .

		COUNT DE GUINES TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 7 July 1775 The news from
America	LOCATION	is not very good .

		You will find the detailed description of a military action , which is not very important in itself , but which shows the capabilities of the rebels .

		The
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	insisted yesterday that it had not been informed of that action ; I had it confirmed by the supporters of the Americans and the facts are true .

		I will do my best to arrange for some connections among these gentlemen .

		I believe that they inform me of what happens in
America	LOCATION	more promptly than
Mylord Rochford	PERSON	.

		This Minister , however , spoke to me yesterday freely and in great detail .

		The decision has been made and the order given to confiscate all the ships belonging to the American rebels or to those who would trade with them .

		The army will occupy
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	and all the ports and there will be no action on land except in last resort .

		They are convinced that in this manner they will starve the Americans by blocking their access to the sea and reduce them to obedience .

		For this purpose they will recall the warships now used on the coasts of
America	LOCATION	and replace them with frigates , corvettes and other types of vessels more apt to keep close to the coast and seize shallow-draught ships .

		This solution which consists in starving the Americans , if it is at all possible , which I doubt very much , is certainly the best in as much as it will end the quarrel sooner .

		This endurance test will cause the loss of
America	LOCATION	to the mother country which needs a people of merchants , not warriors .


Mylord Dunmore	PERSON	, Governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	, was threatened by the rebels .

		In his turn he threatened to free all his slaves if they did not carry out his orders to the smallest detail .

		This threat made them come to their senses ; but is it not a pity that a Nation of Merchants be reduced to freeing the slaves in order to protect its Colonies against its own Colonists !

		They expect to draw many recruits from
Ireland	LOCATION	, maybe two thousand men within a month at most .


Mylord Rochford	PERSON	told me that a regiment , among others , cut down to 20 .

		men was being recalled from
America	LOCATION	with only its officers and colors in order to be brought up to strength with these recruits .

		This is the major drawback of regiments as weak as these British regiments .

		The smallest defeat is a fatal blow to them , and they are destroyed , so to speak , before they even go into action .

		If they send for Hanoverian troops , they will send them to relieve the garrisons at
Gibraltar	LOCATION	and even
Minorca	ORGANIZATION	which they will then use in
America	LOCATION	.

		The Ministry is relying entirely on the Canadians .

		I do not doubt in the least that all necessary steps have been taken to this effect .

		I had not yet heard such positive statements on this subject ... News concerning the Ports .

		The five reserve vessels in
Plymouth	LOCATION	have only four hundred and six men in their crews .

		As a matter of fact , none of these ships has on board more than the required number of men to man her boats .

		All the carpenters of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	and
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	are refusing to work .

		After firing all shipwrights the Count of Sandwich now has to negotiate with them .

		He has asked their
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to send their requests in writing .

		They are asking for about two shillings and six pence per day .

		Captain
Bennet	PERSON	has sent a message to
Portsmouth	LOCATION	from
Newfoundland	LOCATION	saying that the supplies are very scarce .

		The garrison had only four pounds of bread per man per week , and at the time the letter was sent , there was enough bread left to last a week .

		Chicken cost one guinea each .

		A marine writes from
Boston	LOCATION	that there is no bread and that mutton costs one shilling per pound .

		In
Plymouth	LOCATION	, the ship chandler has received the order to bake biscuit in all his ovens for the ships in
America	LOCATION	.

		Arethuse and Lizard are in dry-dock and have the greater part of their crews ;

		Barfleur , Centaure ,
Kent	PERSON	and , the corvette Raven are in

		The ships

		-LSB- Enclosure -RSB- Description of an Action in
America	LOCATION	.

		In the morning of 27 May , around 11 o'clock , a party of provincials were carrying out their orders which took them from
Chelsea	LOCATION	to the Islands of
Hogg	PERSON	and
Noddle	PERSON	in order to remove the livestock from the said islands .

		They were interrupted on their way by a schooner and a corvette detached from the fleet stationed in front of
Boston	LOCATION	and by about forty marines who were under orders to keep watch over the live-stock .

		Nevertheless , the Provincials managed to take a few cows and horses , killed a few and set fire to a barn and a farm .

		Meanwhile , the two warships and a large detachment of marines from these ships which had been lowered in boats fired upon the Americans .

		The latter took refuge in a ditch near a marsh and remained hidden there until they had the opportunity to fire on the marines , which they did , killing three and wounding one of them .

		They proceeded then to the Isle of
Hogg	PERSON	where they were joined by the other members of their party and where they drove away all the live-stock : three or four hundred sheep , a few cows , horses , etc. .

		Both camps kept on exchanging gunfire .

		After cleaning up the Island of
Hogg	PERSON	, the Provincials marched to the Point of
Chelsea	LOCATION	where they drew up in battle array and sent for a reinforcement of three hundred men and two four pounders .

		This reinforcement arrived around nine o'clock in the evening , and a while late , General
Putnam	PERSON	shouted to the schooner saying to the men who manned this ship that if they wished to surrender they would be granted quarter .

		He was answered by two cannon shots which were immediately returned .

		Then violent firing opened on both sides which lasted until eleven o'clock in the evening when the schooner stopped firing .

		The crew had to abandon ship and take to the boats which had been sent in great number to their rescue along with a large detachment of marines which had taken position on the Island of
Noddle	PERSON	with two twelve pounders .

		Without her crew , the schooner ran aground and , at daybreak , the Provincials set fire to her .

		At this time the two twelve pounders opened a violent fire .

		For his part , General
Putnam	PERSON	blazed away at the corvette and battered her to such an extent that the greater part of her crew was killed and she had to be towed by boats .

		All firing ceased then except for a few random shots between
Chelsea	LOCATION	and
Noddle Island	LOCATION	.

		During this long action , the Provincials did not lose a single man .

		They had only four wounded , one of them by his own gun which exploded .

		They removed from the Schooner four four pounders , twelve blunderbuss , most of her sails and rigging , also clothes and money , etc. .

		On the other side there were 20 .

		killed and fifty wounded .

		The price of

Messrs Chambre & Cos.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cargoe , unless you can help me out of it shd be requisite ; for most of my Tobo will be for Home Consumption & will consequently require a large Sum for paymt of the Duties .

		LORD
DARTMOUTH	ORGANIZATION	TO LORD
DUNMORE	PERSON	1 -LRB- No. 22 -RRB-
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	, 12th July 1775 My Lord , This Dispatch accompanies a triplicate of my Letter to your Lordship of the 5th instant , and is intrusted to the Care of Capt Dodsworth who has on board 3000 Stand of Arms with two hundred rounds of Powder & Ball for each Musket , and 4 light Brass 3 pounders to be delivered to your Lordships order .

		Captain
Dodsworth	PERSON	has my Instructions that he do immediately upon his arrival on the Coast of
Virginia	LOCATION	put himself under the Protection of one of His Majesty 's Ships of War and having sent his Letters on shore that he do wait your orders for the disposal of the Arms and other
Military Stores	ORGANIZATION	, Your Lordship will therefore give him those Orders and discharge the Ship as soon as you conveniently can .

		His Majesty hopes that this supply of Arms will arrive Seasonably for those Objects pointed out in your Lordship 's Dispatch of the 1st .

		of May , and that with the Assistance of the Detachment of the 14th Regiment , which I see Genera1 -LSB-
Thomas	PERSON	-RSB-
Gage	PERSON	has authorized your Lordship to send for , and the Men you say you can raise from among Indians , Negroes , & other Persons , you will have Force enough if not to reduce the Colony to obedience , at least to Act upon the Defensive , and withstand those Attacks with which yourself and the rest of the Officers and Friends of Government are menaced .

		Your Lordships fortitude has already been put to a very severe Trial , and the Sacrafice you have made of your own Safety to the Dignity of Government does you the greatest honour , it is not however the
King	ORGANIZATION	's desire that your Lordship should abide all Extremities & the order given to the Commanders of His Majesty 's Ships to receive on board His Majesty 's Governors in Case of necessity implies His Majesty 's Permission to those Governors to avail themselves of that Asylum whenever their personal Safety requires it .

		The situation of Governor
-LSB- Josiah -RSB- Martin	PERSON	in the neighboring Province of
North Carolina	LOCATION	is in many respects similar to that of your Lordship ; the Violences , however , there are not so great as in
Virginia	LOCATION	, and we have reason to hope that some of the Western Counties are firm Friends to Government and ready to Associate against Rebellion , every thing therefore in Our Power has been done to improve that advantage , the Governor is Authorized to encourage the raising a
Battalion of Highlanders	ORGANIZATION	under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel
McLean	PERSON	and lest Governor
Gage	PERSON	should not have it in his power to furnish Arms for that purpose it will be proper that your Lordship should from the supply now sent you , deliver to Governor
Martin	PERSON	's Order , such a portion of them as he shall want , and your Lordship may be able to spare him .

		The Support your Lordship met with from the Gentlemen of the Council who attended you on the 2d of May does them much honor , and I think it affords good ground to hope , that Men of Spirit and property will at length be awakened to a sense of their Situation and of the inevitable ruin which must follow from such a State of total Anarchy and Confusion , as your Lordship represents the Colony to be in .

		WILLIAM LEE TO
RICHARD HENRY	PERSON	LEE 1 My Dear Brother ,
London	LOCATION	13 July 1775 .

		Capn -LSB-
Nathaniel -RSB- Falconer	PERSON	delivered me safely your favour of May the 10 from
Phila	LOCATION	ー The insurances you ordered are made .

		The uncertainty of this reaching you at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, or indeed at all , will prevent me from being so full as I shd otherwise be .

		Our Br A -LSB- rthur -RSB- has wrote I believe pretty largely .

		Notwithstanding the base & wicked attempts of our
Ministry & Genl	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	to disguise the truth 9 tenths of the People here are fully convinced that the Civil War was commenced by Genl
Gage	PERSON	.

		ー I can with truth & pleasure assure you that the repeated success of the Provincials since the 19th of April gives almost universal pleasure here , but still you are not to expect any really spirited exertions on the part of the people untill they feel , which they do not at present , because large remittances have been made to the Merchts in generall & unfortunately chiefly to the most ministerial ones ; who besides it is said , have privately negotiated with the minister to prevail on the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	to lend them # 300,000 ー part of which a Tobo Mercht is to share , who has made a great parade to his correspondents of his services last winter .

		ー Indeed if things are ever settled a reform must be made respecting the American Merchts for half the present mischeif has arisen from their Villainy & Treachery to you.ー The Governor of Virginias conduct in robing you of yr powder & the Proclamation agt -LSB-
Patrick -RSB- Henry	PERSON	, with the Councils contemptible & stupid address to the people , makes a fair opening for a reform in your constitution & Government which is founded on as arbitrary & tyranical a system as can well be contrived ; the mode of summoning Juries is open to ten thousand objections & in process of time will be a dreadful engine of oppression in the hands of a Tyrant .

		The late constitution of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	or the present of
Connecticut	LOCATION	&
Rhode Island	LOCATION	seem the most eligible.ー Now is the time to form a proper mode of internal Government which may last for many Centuries , & if 't is lost or disregarded , the opty may never occur again .

		We have various reports of what the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is about but nothing shall I believe that is not authenticated with the name of
Charles Thomson	PERSON	.


Capn Falconer	PERSON	has all the papers , there are no publications worth sending which you have not already had .

		The Corporation of
London	LOCATION	has at last agreed to Petition the King in your behalf a copy of which I inclose , it is to be delivered on Friday -LSB- July 14 -RSB- & perhaps you will get the answer with this .

		The Ministers have however sent orders to
Genl Gage	PERSON	to persevere & to go out of
Boston	LOCATION	to dispossess the Provincials of their strong places , Genl -LSB- Guy -RSB-
Carlton	PERSON	is orderd to send down on the back Country the 3,000 Canadians , which he has wrote he can spare for Gages assistance -LRB- blessed fruit of the Quebec Act -RRB- & a highland regiment is to be compleated to 1000 with highlanders under a Ld
John Murray	PERSON	, to be sent as soon as compleated to
America	LOCATION	.

		From
Quebec	LOCATION	they expect to be able to get fresh provisions sufficient for the
Army & fleet	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	.

		If they get men at all , it must be from
Scotland	LOCATION	or among the Irish Roman Catholics , for the American War is really so odious & disgusting to the Common people in
England	LOCATION	that no Soldiers or Sailors will inlist , for without pressing they can not in two months man two twenty gun ships , nor have they for 3 Months past inlisted 20 Soldiers in all
England	LOCATION	, tho ' recruiting parties are all over the Country .

		Added to this the
Shipwrights	ORGANIZATION	at
Plymouth	ORGANIZATION	,
Portsmouth	LOCATION	,
Gosport	LOCATION	,
Chatham & Sheerness	ORGANIZATION	to amt of 3000 , have all left off work , on Acct of their ill usage , when they have not 3 ships in all the yards fit to put to sea .

		These Men call 'd on me yesterday with their petition which they are to present to the K -- g tomorrow .

		't is spirited & bold .

		to compleat the affaire two daies ago an express arrived from
Gibralter	LOCATION	, by a Man of Wars cutter the Capts .

		brother I have seen , who says , they expected the same wind which bro ' t him to
England	LOCATION	wd bring the Spanish
fleet & Army	ORGANIZATION	from
Carthagena	LOCATION	to
Giberalter	PERSON	, that the works on the Sea side were quite in ruins & that he does not doubt the place surrendering if attacked .


Europe	LOCATION	has not seen such an Armament , since the famous Armada in Queen
Elizabeths	PERSON	time , 60 Sail of the line , besides smaller vessels & transports , with 30,000 land forces all collected within a days sail of Giberalter .

		Under these difficulties with every thing in confusion in the
East Indias	LOCATION	, our Mule & his Drivers B -LSB- u -RSB- te & M -LSB- a -RSB- nsf -LSB- iel -RSB- d are determined to ruin
America	LOCATION	, if they can ー Things look very well ー You have nothing to do but to persevere , as we are told you are proceeding ー prepare for a vigorous defence at the same time hold out your plan of accomodation in the form of an American bill of rights in which you shd not forget to new model the several arbitrary Colonial constitutions , such as
Virginia	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	& c. ー the people shd choose all their own Officers annually -LRB- unless the appointment of the Commander in chief remaining in the Crown -RRB- as in the
New England	LOCATION	Provinces .


Canada	LOCATION	shd be reduced to its Antient boundaries where religions shd be tolerated as in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	but none established .

		Assemblies shd of right be held every year & a Genl
Congress	ORGANIZATION	annually or once in two years at least to consider & settle the common interest of all the Colonies .

		Tis reported , the
Genl Congress	ORGANIZATION	are about publishing a Manifesto to all the World & to open yr ports to all nations ; shd this prove true the maritime powers of
Europe	LOCATION	must fight in yr cause for the benefit of yr commerce .

		Shd
Spain	LOCATION	attack
Giberalter	PERSON	, you may immediately settle yr own terms ー if they do not , the Ministers are determined to try the issue of this campaign , if they are unsuccessful , they must yield the contest ; if successful they will go on , but even then , I am satisfied they will not be able to add 2000 Men more Next year to the present force they have in
America	LOCATION	ー You know whether that will be sufficient to subdue you .

		COUNT DE GUINES TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 14 July 1775
Mylord Rochford	PERSON	talked to the Ambassador of
Spain	LOCATION	of a coming impressment .

		As a matter of fact , since the reserve ships have crews only for their boats , an impressment seems to be the only way to send to the American Coast the frigates and other ships which are to intercept the trade of the Americans .

		Meanwhile it will provoke unfortunate circumstances on the English Coast where an impressment is always considered as a tyranny , unless it is based on patriotic reasons which would substitute a national enthusiasm for the real interests of trade .

		A ship , arrived a few days ago , has seen along the
New England	LOCATION	coast the ships carrying the reinforcements for General
Gage	PERSON	.

		The rebels made several proposals which were called inadmissible by the Government , to wit : the recall of the troops , the annulment as soon as possible of the four acts relating to
America	LOCATION	, the renunciation by the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	of all rights to tax the Colonies .

		The Government would be willing to enter into this last engagement ; but to annul the Acts and leave to the Americans the freedom of trade , which is what they really want , this would mean losing
America	LOCATION	, even more , it would mean losing
England	LOCATION	whose population would leave everyday for
America	LOCATION	in larger number .

		The Minister hopes that these proposals are a step towards more acceptable ones .

		He is convinced that the Americans will give up .

		As for me , I can not believe it .

		Encouraged and enlightened by most eminent leaders , they are sure of their success if only by temporizing .

		COUNT DE GUINES TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 28 July 1775 This Minister -LSB-
Mylord Rochford	PERSON	-RSB- told me in confidence yesterday that a number of people in both parties were privately convinced that the way to end the war in
America	LOCATION	was to declare it on
France	LOCATION	.

		He added that he was sorry to see this opinion gaining credence .

		We discussed this question for a long time and most amicably : I can assure you , Sir , that everything said in favor of this opinion is most extraordinary and disquieting .

		The Spanish Alliance does not stop the supporters of this plan ; they say that
England	LOCATION	successfully managed both this power and
France	LOCATION	together in the course of the last war and they support their theory with this example .

		They insist all the more because of the defeat which the Spaniards have just suffered and which will be a terrible blow to our political esteem here .

		They proclaim that the fear of an English defeat which would bring
France	LOCATION	back to
Canada	LOCATION	is the most effective scarecrow in the case of the Americans who dread the proximity of our religion and government ; finally , they say that this war would force the Americans to give up their projects of freedom and decide between us or the British and that they certainly would show their preference for the latter .

		I can assure you , Sir , that Myd .


Rochford	PERSON	himself is convinced of all that and I believe that these principles are most dangerous in the present circumstances .

		After all why is the
Ministry of His British Majesty	ORGANIZATION	so peaceful towards us ?

		It is in order to keep their positions and they feel that they could not do so during a war which they are ill-fitted to wage .

		We should not seek nobler views on their part : for the same reason , they may become belligerent if they have nothing better to do and if the greater part of the Nation comes to want war .

		As I feel compelled , Sir , to present these truths to the King and his Council , I must not either hide from them that it is equally necessary as it is dangerous to organise our defense : necessary , because we must not be taken by surprise ; dangerous , because we would cause alarms here .

		Indeed , it is very difficult to find the middle course .

		WILLIAM LEE TO
GEORGE MASON	PERSON	1 Dear Sir !


London	LOCATION	29 July 1775 The Adventure Capt Brown is arriv 'd & brot me yr very obliging favr of June 1st wth 100 hhds of yr Tobo wch .

		I before wrote you via
Phila	LOCATION	were insured according to yr orders .

		You may be assured of my best endeavors to return you satisfactory Sales , but the situation of things here is so perplexed & alarming that it is impossible to judge with precision whether it will be best to sell now or wait the Winter market ; for my own part I am well inclined to think the prices are now as high as they will be for 6 Mos to come & if the event of parliamty interposition wch you apprehend , & not with out reason , shd interfere things will not mend .

		When we consider the great loss of weight , especially when
Tobo	PERSON	is landed at this season of the year it is perhaps most advantageous to sell as soon as possible , however as I am fortunately not in distress for money , you may rely on my acting as appears to me most beneficial for you .

		The present prices , tho ' no great demand , are for export 3 1/4 to 4 P lb for the best stout , wavy & black Jas River Tobo The home consumption price not better , unless for the finest
York	LOCATION	river & clean good stemd Tobo It is clear to me that the American trade to G.B. can never be restored to its former channel .

		I have more at stake in this business than most people , however the love I have for my Country , as well as an ardent affection for universal Liberty makes me submit with patience to the decrees of
Providence	LOCATION	which I am convinced over rules in this unhappy contest between G.B. & the Colonies ; ー therefore am sure , as Justice is the most amiable attribute of an almighty direction , that you must in the end be successful .

		ー We have only the Ministl Act of the Bloody engagemt on the 17 June at
Charles Town	LOCATION	near
Boston	LOCATION	, wch from thence appears greatly to the disadvantage of the Regulars .

		The Ministers still have no thought of relentg & fresh supplies of Arms & Ammunition are preparing to be sent to
Boston	LOCATION	ー All I can say is ,
Quen Deus	PERSON	vult perdere , prius dementat ー
America	LOCATION	must now be a great Empire or a sink for Slaves ー Mrs.

PHILIP STEPHENS	PERSON	TO VICE ADMIRAL
SAMUEL	PERSON	GRAVES 1 Sr -LSB-
Admiralty Office	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- 3d Augt 1775 In my Letter of the 25th of last Month by the
Folkstone Cutter	ORGANIZATION	I acknowledged generally the receipt of your Letters of the 7th 14th 16th 20th 22d & 26th of June ; I now set down to answer in detail such of them as require it , And beginning with the first , in which you give an Account of the Diana Schooner being attacked & burnt by the Rebels and inclose the sentence of the Court Martial held for enquiring into the cause of the loss of her ; I am to acquaint you that their Lordships are well satisfied with the testimony given by the Court , and with what you have related , of the gallant Behaviour of the Lieutenant who commanded her , and of her Company in general But they can not for reasons that must be obvious to you think of making a precedent of compensating the Officers & Crew of the Kings Ships destroyed by the Enemy for the losses they may sustain on such occasions .

		The Cases of the Diana & Gaspee are by no means similar ; Nor do I find that the information you have received of a compensation being made to the Crew of the latter is well founded .

		Their Lordships approve of the application you made to Genl -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	to have the Boats at
Boston	LOCATION	belonging to the Rebels delivered to you for the
Kings	ORGANIZATION	use ; And they command me to acquaint you that as Flat bottom 'd Boats may be very useful to you they have ordered Twenty to be forthwith provided capable of receiving 40 Soldiers & 16 Rowers each to be sent out by the Transports that are now directed to be taken up to carry 5 Regiments of Foot from
Cork to Boston	ORGANIZATION	over & above the
Yawls & Cutters	ORGANIZATION	which you have already been informed the
Navy Board	ORGANIZATION	are directed to send to you ; And as their Lordships apprehend that there may be a want of
Fewell	PERSON	at
Boston	LOCATION	they have it in contemplation to order the Transports abovementioned to be ballasted with Coals for the use of the
Fleet & Army	ORGANIZATION	; as also to cause the Ships of War which shall hereafter be sent to you , to take in an extra quantity.ー Their Lordships will in consideration of what you represented as to the great discount as well as uncertainty of getting Money at
Boston for Bills	ORGANIZATION	, direct the
Navy Board	ORGANIZATION	to send to their Officer there a proper supply of
Mony	ORGANIZATION	for the use of the
Naval Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their Lordships having taken into their consideration the Disposition you have sent them of the
Squadron of His Majestys Ships	ORGANIZATION	under your command as also what you represent as to the want of more Ships to enable you to supply particular & urgent Applications from almost all the Colonies for protection & assistance , and for preventing improper Commerce & communication , have come to a Resolution to augment the Reinforcement that is preparing to be sent out to you ; And conceiving that the Force mentioned in the inclosed Scheme will enable you to perform in the most effectual manner the Services upon which you are employed , They command me to inform you that in addition to the Ships mentioned in my Letters of the 24th June , 6 & 25th Ultmo which were then actually fitting out , and are now in great forwardness , they have ordered the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	, by which you will receive this to remain under your command , and will send seven more Frigates to you of 32 & 28 Guns as soon as they can be got ready , to complete the Force beforementioned : But altho ' you will find by the said Scheme that particular Numbers of Ships & Vessels are allotted to each of the Colonies within the extent of your command , their Lordships do not mean that you should therefore confine yourself to the disposing of your Force precisely in that manner , but leave it intirely to you to make such other disposition of it as you shall judge most likely to answer the important Objects to which it is to be directed .

		The Lizard is now at
Spithead	LOCATION	under Orders to Convoy a
Storeship	ORGANIZATION	freighted with
Arms & Military Stores & Cloathing	ORGANIZATION	to
Quebec	LOCATION	, and then to repair to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The Actaeon is also under Orders to Convoy from the
Downes	PERSON	a Storeship freighted in like manner to
Virginia	LOCATION	and then to proceed to
South Carolina	LOCATION	, where , it has been represented , the presence of a Frigate is absolutely necessary But if you have made any other provision for that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	and
Georgia	LOCATION	, you will in that case send such directions to Capt -LSB-
Christopher -RSB- Atkins Commr	PERSON	of the Actaeon as you shall judge proper for his further proceedings You will have observed by my former Letters their Lordships anxiety for the return of the three Guardships to
England	LOCATION	before the Winter sets in , and that the 50 & 44 Gun Ships are sent to you with a view to supply their Places ; I am therefore to signify their Lordships direction to you that , so soon as any three of those 50 or 44 Gun Ships shall arrive at
Boston	LOCATION	, you do direct the Captains of the three Guardships to proceed immediately with them to
England	LOCATION	or at least two of them , and the third as soon afterwards as the Nature and importance of the Service upon which she is employed will admit of it .

		I have acquainted you in former Letters that Mr
-LSB- Marriot -RSB- Arbuthnot	PERSON	is ordered to proceed to
Halifax	LOCATION	in the quality of a Commissioner of His
Majestys Navy	ORGANIZATION	for the better dispatch of His Majestys Naval Affairs in
North America	LOCATION	, that the
Navy Board	ORGANIZATION	are directed to send out a supply of
Stores for the Squadron	ORGANIZATION	under your command ; It is their Lordships intention to send out further Supplies of every thing that may be requisite to enable you to carry on the important Services intrusted to your care ; And they therefore recommend it to you to send them in your future Letters particular Accounts of the quantities & Species of Stores which you conceive may be necessary for that purpose .

		Their Lordships also wish to receive with your next Letter an Account of the quantity and Specie of Provisions , not only on board of the Ships under your command , but what is in store for their use , And also the supplies which you can depend upon receiving from the Contractors , shewing how long the same will serve the whole
Squadron	ORGANIZATION	at full Allowance Their Lordships observe by the disposition you have sent them of the Force under your command that only One Frigate is stationed at
Halifax	LOCATION	for the protection of the Magazines there , But as
Halifax	LOCATION	is now become the only Place on the
Continent of America	LOCATION	where the Ships of your Squadron can be refitted or repaired , or from whence they can receive any supply of Stores they may stand in need of , It is of the utmost importance to His Majestys Service that His Naval Yard and Magazines there should be secured against attack from the Rebels : And their Lordships therefore earnestly recommend it to you to concert with Genl -LSB-
Thomas -RSB- Gage	PERSON	the most effectual Measures to be taken for that Purpose understanding that the General will have received His Majestys Commands upon that head .

		Their Lordships are of Opinion that it may be useful for the Ships that are to be sent out to you to be furnished with the private Signals you have made for the
Ships of your Squadron	ORGANIZATION	to know each other ; And I am to desire you will send me by the first safe conveyance a Copy of those Signals that their Lordships may distribute them as they see occasion & c P S By the

		COUNT DE GUINES TO COUNT DE
VERGENNES	ORGANIZATION	1 -LSB- Extract -RSB-
London	LOCATION	, 4 August 1775 The Spanish affair seems to have the most disturbing results here .

		The King of
England	LOCATION	had the courtesy to forbid that any reference to this matter be made in the Gazette of the Court .

		He did not speak of it to the Prince of
Masseran	LOCATION	; 2 but he conversed a long time about it with me trustingly and with pleasure .

		From the details which this Prince has received , it is obvious that the Walloon and Spanish Guards forming the vanguard went into action without awaiting the completion of the landing , an unfortunate result from the lack of discipline to which many people would still substitute the `` esprit de corps '' .

		The King of
England	LOCATION	can not conceive how the Admiral could land all his supplies in the thirty hours time which the troops spent on shore , putting himself into such a position that he could not shell
Algiers	LOCATION	.

		It seems that there was in this expedition a frightening intrigue which caused its failure .

		His British Majesty seemed to be convinced of that ; He even said so to me in the greatest secret , adding that it was intended for me alone ; those were his words .

		I must not keep any secrets from the King , and I throw myself on the caution which His Majesty will deem necessary to show in making use of this information ... Yesterday I saw
Milady Dunmore	PERSON	who just arrived from
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		She told me the dreadful story of all that goes on there .

		She was almost arrested as a hostage .

		Her husband hardly had the time to put her on board ship and himself take refuge on board a ship .

		However , at the time of his departure he had not yet taken the decision , which I mentioned to you in my preceding letters to free all the negroes .

		The position of this
Colony	ORGANIZATION	is all the more interesting because it is the most populated in all
Northern America	LOCATION	.

		I enclose a copy of the message she presented for Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	.

		It is remarkable , Sir , in as much as it shows : first , the well established claim to the freedom of trade , which is , as I always stated because it is so , an unsurmountable obstacle to any conciliation ; secondly , the opinion about
Mylord Chatham	LOCATION	which is still held in this part of the world and the effect it may have in the latter .

		Five Infantry Regiments from
Ireland	LOCATION	have received the order to embark on 10 September for
America	LOCATION	, as well as a detachment of Artillery with a complement of 200 men , and two to three thousand recruits .

		I was told by
Mylord Barrington	PERSON	, Secretary of War , that they would add two Cavalry Regiments to this expedition .

		The frigate Lizard has sailed for
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		Since the report I sent you on the 23rd of last month , two other frigates and a corvette have been ordered to sail for
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Thus , the number of troops now in
America	LOCATION	or under orders to go there comes to 17,796 men , the number of warships comes to 62 and the number of sailors to 10,410 .

		This is quite a number of people and ships .

		The expedition of Cavalry Regiments seems to deserve some attention for it is a fact that the dragoons , now in
Boston	LOCATION	, are of no use whatever ; the interior of the country is so interce -LSB- p -RSB- ted by walls and ditches that , should one be able to penetrate it , the cavalry would be most ill at ease .

		Besides , the precence of all these troops is not in agreement with what
Mylord Rochford	PERSON	always stated to me , the project of war by means of the sea .

		Truly , Sir , you can see from my last dispatches that this Minister is not very consistent .

		But he constantly refers to this plan by which war at sea and ruination of the trade are the only means to subdue the Americans unfailingly .

		Lately he even used in this matter a rather unusual comparison which he gave me as the basis for the decisions taken by the Council of the King of
England	LOCATION	.

		`` Sir , he said to me , we , at the Council , are convinced that it would be just as impossible to persuade the Americans to do without luxury as it would be to persuade ourselves and every one of us to do without clairet wine . ''

		This policy is neither noble , nor sober ; and I believe that it befits them more than the Americans .

		Be that as it may , it is their policy , and an
Army	ORGANIZATION	on land is absolutely useless for the purpose of ruining the American trade , purpose , however , which the said policy proclaims as the only principle governing the English operations and views .

		The affairs in
Canada	LOCATION	are becoming serious , and I do not doubt that
Mylord Rochford	PERSON	gave me a false piece of news when he positively said to me that he had good reason to rely entirely upon the Canadians ... .

		I know from someone who just arrived from
Quebec	LOCATION	and
Montreal	LOCATION	that public opinion there is anything but disposed to take the side of
England	LOCATION	.

		Apparently , the raising of the militia is encountering a great deal of difficulty .

		If it is to take place , it will only be by force .

		BRITISH INTELLIGENCE REPORT 1 -LSB- Extract -RSB- Received 6 August 1775 What I have been able to collect from the two French Officers , by employing evry art , and all the address I am master of , amounts to what follow 's ... 2 That during their stay in
America	LOCATION	, seven French Ships , marqued under English colors , came into Different ports with ammunition & ca , and that these Ships would have risqued an engagement rather than submit to be visited by a small ship of war , had they been met by one .

		That The Americans expected
French & Spanish Officers & Engineers	ORGANIZATION	, also Powder & ca , to be carried over from time to time , in small numbers , & in small quantitys , not only by ships directly from
England	LOCATION	& our
West Indies	LOCATION	, but by French & Spanish Ships from their
Islands	LOCATION	, such ships to appear to be American property , & to be mann 'd chiefly with American sailors , that the European courts may not be detected , should such ships be taken .

		COUNT DE
VERGENNES	LOCATION	, FRENCH MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS , TO COUNT DE GUINES , AMBASSADOR TO GREAT
BRITAIN	LOCATION	1 7 Augst 1775 ,
Versailles	LOCATION	I have shown the King , Sir , the proposition you made of bringing about the return to
America	LOCATION	of
M. -LSB- Achard -RSB- de Bonvouloir	PERSON	whose acquaintances in , and understanding of , that country are known to you .

		I do not doubt but what you are sure he is what he says he is , for I must warn you that there is nothing in the
Navy Bureau	ORGANIZATION	which proves that this Frenchman has been attached in any capacity to the
Cape	LOCATION	regiment .

		At any rate , His Majesty has arranged that
M. de Sartines	PERSON	at your request draw up a commission as Lieutenant on the staff of the regiment : you will find it enclosed .

		As for the annual payment of 200 Louis that you propose , the King will authorize it and you will draw on me for extra charges for quarters ; but the King in granting you this sum does not intend that you should give up what you proposed in procuring intelligence in the
Bureau of Plantations	ORGANIZATION	.

		If it is interesting to be instructed about what happens in
North America	LOCATION	, it is equally interesting to know what orders can be sent there and even into the other colonies ; this knowledge could only spread out some day over the existence of the project you suspect .

		The King strongly approves your resolution is sending
M. de Bonvoiloir	PERSON	, with enough precaution that in any case his mission can not compromise us .

		I believe we can allow him to take service among the rebels if his taste carries him there ; he is a soldier of fortune whose personal steps can never be of consequence .

		We must be sure our correspondence can not be intercepted .

		You should reduce his instructions , which can only be verbal , to two matters which seem to me to be the most essential : one , to render a faithful account of events and the general feeling of men 's minds ; the other , to reassure Americans against the fear which no doubt is being raised against us .


Canada	LOCATION	is the sore point for them and they must understand that we do not think about it at all and that rather than envying them their liberty and independence that they are working to acquire , we admire on the contrary the grandeur and nobility of their efforts and that , without interest in harming them , we shall with pleasure see those happy circumstances that allow them to frequent our ports ; the facilities that they will find there for their trade will soon prove to them the esteem we have for them .

		The King counts on your vigilance and your care in informing him promptly Sir about everything you deem interesting .

		We are sure Sir that you will not postpone until the time of your weekly dispatch sending us knowledge that is urgent that you send to us 1 .
