Abraham	PERSON	close to the city , wou 'd advance and enter the gates without resistance , for such was the consternation , that the gates were not shut , when the enemy was within a mile of them ー And the apprehensions of the Lieut Governor were such , that he thought it adviseable to send back the Store Ship , least she shou 'd fall into the hands of the Rebels ー She took her departure , but fortunately as the events afterwards turned up , was obliged to return , as the River was so much frozen up that it was impossible for her to proceed .
Hamilton	PERSON	, since created a Baronet , and his Officers endeavoured to animate and encourage the Inhabitants to take arms in their own defence , by Offering to lay up the Frigate , and disembark his men to do Garrison duty , and to give them every Assistance in their power , for His Majesty 's Service ー At this time ,
Lieut Col Maclean	PERSON	who had crossed the country arrived in the Town with about 100 Men ー His activity and exertions contributed to give spirits to the people , and rouse them from their despondency , and with so good an effect , that when Captain
Hamilton	PERSON	met the principal Inhabitants to know their final determination , they consented to act in their own defence .
Hamilton	PERSON	, laying an embargo upon all the Shipping in the
Starke	PERSON	being then second Lieutenant of the Lizard , served as a Captain therein , during the Seige ...

PHILLIP CALLBECK	PERSON	AND THOMAS WRIGHT The Case of
Phillip Callbeck	PERSON	late commander in Chief of the Island St
John	PERSON	and
Thomas Wright	PERSON	one of the Council , Justice of the peace , and Surveyor General of said Island : ー Addressed to His Excellency General
Broughton	PERSON	and
Selmon	PERSON	who commanded said Vessels landed with two parties under their command ; ー That Mr Call beck met Captain
Selmon	PERSON	on his landing , who notwithstanding a very Civil reception immediately order 'd him on board his Vessel without permitting him to return to his
Calbeck	PERSON	was conveyed on board he received a messuage from Captain
Salmon	PERSON	to send the
Callbeck	PERSON	instantly sent the Keys with one of his Clerks -LRB- who was detained a prisoner -RRB- that he might attend and opeh the doors of such places as the Captains choose to inspect , upon the Clerks informing him of Mr
Callbecks	PERSON	directions , the Captain told him he did not want his assistance , and desired him to deliver the Keys which he accordingly did .
Broughton	PERSON	and
Selmon	PERSON	with their party immediately proceeded to a Store in which were a large assortment of Goods all of which except some Earthenware they sent on board Captain 's Selmons Vessel after which -LRB- although they had the Keys of the doors -RRB- they broke open two other stores out of which they took the most Valuable articles together with the entire stock of provisions that Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	had provided for his Familys winter support and the Inhabitants immediately about him .
Callbeck	PERSON	's dwelling house where they examined all his private papers and broke the Bed chamber 's Closets and cellar doors open though they had all the Keys .
Mrs Callbeck	PERSON	's bed room they broke open her drawers and Trunks scatter 'd her Cloaths about read her Letters from her Mother and Sisters , took the Bed and window curtains , also the Bed & bedding , and they or some of the party took
Mrs Callbeck	PERSON	's Rings Bracelets Buckles and Trinkets , also some of their Cloaths .
Callbe	PERSON	-LSB- ck 's -RSB- cellar all his Wine , porter , Rum ,
Mrs Callbeck	PERSON	's little stores of
Bacon	PERSON	& c. ー Notwithstanding they having done what is here related , they next went to Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	's Office , from which they took two Trunks full of Goods .
Callbecks Cloaths	PERSON	, all his Shoes & c That after they had ravaged Mr
Callbecks	PERSON	house and out Houses , they broke into Governor
Patterson	PERSON	's
Wright	PERSON	into custody and brought him on board the Vessel where Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	was confined and to keep pace with their barbarity Captain
Selmon	PERSON	order 'd his party to go in to take Mr
Wright	PERSON	from the arms of his Wife and Sister , and insultingly smiled at the Tears and Lamentations of Women who were in the greatest distress , being seperated from their Husband and Brother .
Wright	PERSON	came on board he and Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	represented the treatment they had received , the confidence they had that the Captains had no orders to commit such outrag -LSB- es -RSB- and they in order to justify themselves read your Excellencys instructions by which it appear 'd they were not directed to go to the Island and that your Excellency had particularly cautioned them not to abuse private property ; upon which Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	wi -LSB- th -RSB- Mr
Wright	PERSON	labour 'd all in their power to convince them of their not having in any respect conformed to their instructions , they further represented the Cruelty of taking them away for tho ' it was probable they would be imediately dismissed , yet it would be almost impossible for them to get back to the
Callbeck	PERSON	-LRB- and his Effects -RRB- and Mr
Wright	PERSON	ー That Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	supposes they have in their custody of his property to the amount of two thousand pounds sterling ー to exaggerate the cruel treatment he has received is impossible and it is equally so even to give an exact detail of the injuries that have been offered to him and his property ー His papers all read some of which were of a very private nature ー Notwithstanding they had all his Keys , his Doors broke open , his Effects taken away the provisions and necessaries he had provided for his Families support taken away and , wantonly destroyed ー His Wife left destitute of every support , also between 70 and 80 people who were lately arrived on the
Callbeck	PERSON	for their support during the Winter will in all probabillity Starve .
Callbeck	PERSON	's being taken away he is debarred from assisting
Mrs Callbeck	PERSON	who is left without any support , not so much as a Candle to burn beside the necessity of taking the necessary care of what remains of a shatter 'd Fortune ; what has been left of his property on the
Callbeck	PERSON	open to these apprehensions for altho ' it was urged and requested by his Clerks that an Inventory should be taken of the Effects the Captains took away ー They would not permit it nor would they suffer the Clerks to stand by while they were taking the , things away , and to make the matter still more , doubtfull and to give the inhabitants an opportunity to plunder , the Captains after they apprehended Mr
Wright	PERSON	suffer 'd some of their people to remain on Shore -LRB- without an Officer -RRB- who broke a second time into Governor
Patterson	PERSON	and Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	's Houses and took out of them what they pleased , and finished what LiquGrs that had been left in both Houses .
Callbeck	PERSON	's property were found in the custody of some of the Marines , so that even upon a supposition that Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	should be order 'd his property , he will doubtless be a considerable looser .
Callbeck	PERSON	and
Wright	PERSON	thus wantonly torn from their Families have been brought in a state of
Lyne	PERSON	-RRB- they travelld without any Guard .
Lyne	PERSON	and was conducting them to your Excellency insisted that they should attend him as his Prisoners and if it was not for Colonel
Tompsons	PERSON	humane interposition , they suppose they would have been treated as Captives whose deserts merited the worst usage ー That Mr
Callbeck	PERSON	and
Wright	PERSON	have taken the Liberty to trouble your Excellency with the state of their Case , in order to be releived in such manner as to your Excellency shall appear reasonable which will confer a lasting obligation on them who are with respect ー Sir your Excellency 's -LSB- & c. -RSB-
