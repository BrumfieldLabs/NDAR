<                <p2>SIR,  A Number of fire-arms of British manufacture, legally imported, having been
<                   lately seized by yo{ir orders and conveyed on board the man of war, by which
<                   arbitrary step you have declared yourself an inveterate enemy to the liberties of
<                   North-America; in this light we view you, and from you we shall demand those arms
<                   whenever they are wanted, which is probable will be soon. You will therefore, if
<                   you have the least regard to the safety of yourself or your servants, who seized
<                   them, be careful to prevent their being sent away, as you may depend upon
<                   answering for a contrary conduct with a vengeance. ー We thought that your former
<                   genteel conduct in your department, intitled you to this notice, otherwise we
<                   should have been silent till a proper opportunity had offered, in which we might
<                   have done our country justice, by wreaking our resentment on you in a private
<                   manner: Do not slight this admonition or treat it as a vain menace, for we have
<                   most solemnly sworn to effect it sooner or later, and you know that our nation are
<                   implacable, we would not have you imagine that it is in the power of any set of
<                   men, either civil or military to protect or shield you from our just revenge,
<                   which will be soon done; and in such manner as not to be known till it is fatally
<                   experienced by you.</p2>
<                <sig>From the <ital>Mohawks and River Indians</ital>.</sig>
<             </ind>
<             <p>The above was immediately copied and sent to the Coffee-house, where it was pasted up
<                together with the Collectors answer, viz.</p>
<             <ind>
<                <p>The original, of which the above is a copy, Mr. [Andrew] Elliot this morning
<                   received from the Post-office; he is obliged to answer it in this public manner,
<                   being entirely unacquainted with the author.</p>
<                <p>Mr. Elliot calls upon the person to appear, that can in any instance accuse him of
<                   having acted either arbitrarily or illegally in his office, that he may have an
<                   opportunity of answering him properly.</p>
<                <p>If the letter is wrote with a view to deter an officer from his duty, Mr. Elliot
<                   assures the writer, that as long as he has the honour to act as Collector, of the
<                   port of New-York, he will exert the same attention and firmness, that has for ten
<                   years past, enabled him to give satisfaction to his superiors in office; and to
<                   live happily among the inhabitants of this city.</p>

<                <sal>My Dear Friends and Fellow Citizens,</sal>
<                <p>At a time when slavery is clanking her infernal chains, and tyranny stands ready
<                   with goads and whips to enforce obedience to her despotic and cruel mandates; when
<                   oppression, with gigantic strides is approaching your once happy retreats, and her
<                   tools and minions are eagerly grasping, to seize the cup from the lip of industry;
<                   will you supinely fold your arms; and calmly see your weapons of defence torn from
<                   you, by a band of ruffians? You, whose glorious and renowned ancestors, freely
<                   lavished their blood and treasure, to secure to you the full enjoyment of liberty,
<                   that greatest of all temporal blessings; forbid it, Heaven! forbid it gratitude
<                   and honour! ー How long will you patiently bear insult and wrong? Are you so
<                   callous and dead to every sense of honour, as to disregard your reputation; and
<                   the taunts and scoffs, of your fellow subjects in the neighbouring colonies? What
<                   is become of your former magnanimity and spirit; you who dared to degrade the
<                   Governor of the province, and exhibit his effigy, under the very muzzle of his
<                      cannon?<fn>2</fn> Are you dwindled to such dastards and poltroons, as to suffer
<                   yourselves to be insulted, and robbed of your arms, by a few petty Custom-house
<                   officers, with impunity? Methinks I hear you say, it cannot, it must not be: ー
<                   Rouze then, my friends and countrymen, rouze and play the men upon this occasion;
<                   convince the world that you are still possessed of the same noble spirit, by which
<                   you were actuated in former times, and that whoever injures you, shall not fail to
<                   feel the weight of your resentment; your country has been basely robbed (by the
<                   officers of the customs) of a considerable number of arms, which were legally
<                   exported from Great-Britain, and imported here, in the ship <ship><name>Lady
<                         Gage</name></ship>,<fn>3</fn> and therefore not liable to a seizure, upon
<                   any pretence whatsoever, as they are actually the manufacture of England: ー Those
<                   arms (I am credibly informed) are now on board the man of war, and are in a few
<                   days to be sent to General [Thomas] Gage, and of consequence are to be used for
<                   your destruction: Can you bear such a thought? especially when you have it in your

<             <p>Early next morning a number of the principal merchants assembled, waited on the

<             <p>They then accompanied him to the Coffee House, where he was met by numbers of the
<                inhabitants of all ranks (among whom was a number of Masters of ships, with their
<                men) who appeared, with readiness to shew how much they esteemed the Collector as a

<             <p>Some gentlemen then called upon the authors of the letter or hand-bill to appear, or

<                their duty, must be abhorred by all men that wish the support of civil government and
<                good order; that in the present case it appeared the Collector had done nothing but

<             <p>The justness of this proposal, and the inclination of the people present to adopt it,

>             merchants, masters of vessels, and ship-carpenters, was then handed into this Committee,
>             purporting that said vessel was unfit to go to sea until the goods were taken out, and
>             she thoroughly repaired, yet it appeared that Captain Coulson had not taken due care to
>             get said Sloop repaired, nor had endeavoured to procure another, in which to reship the
>             goods to Bristol, and would give the Committee no assurance that he would send them
>             back, in any other manner than he at first proposed. The Committee then adjourned to the

>          <ind>
>             <p>That if Captain Coulson will re-ship the aforesaid goods in some other vessel, and
>                send them back immediately, without breaking any of the packages, it will be
>                satisfactory to this Committee.</p>
>          </ind>
>          <p>To this Captain Coulson (who was again desired to attend, to hear the Committee's
>             determination) would not consent, though one of this Committee offered him a vessel
>             gratis, to carry them to Halifax or Newfoundland.</p>
>          <p>We, the said Committee of Inspection, do therefore, agreeable to the directions of the
>             said Continental Congress, as expressed in the said Eleventh Article of their

<                   formatted="Dashwood Bacon">Dashwood Bacon</name> and others (probably

<                That they should attempt to clear themselves, in the manner they have, is not much to
<                be admired, since it commonly happens that the most daring murderers plead "Not
<                guilty" but when those who are called men, are grown so callous as to be insensible
<                of the compunctions of conscience, and hardened as to deny the voice of truth, even
<                in the face of the Sun, it then becomes necessary more methodically to arraign them,
<                and investigate their conduct before the tribunal of the People, that so, if
<                possible, they may be subjected to the punishment and contempt which they justly
<                deserve; for which purpose the following depositions relative to the aforesaid abuse,
<                are here presented to the world, viz:</p>
<             <p2>Wilmington Borough, ss.</p2>
<             <p>Personally appeared before me <name formatted="John M'kinley">John M'Kinley</name>,
<                Esq; chief burgess of said borough, Nathan Wood, who being solemnly affirmed, doth
<                declare and say, that he was lately a passenger on board <name
<                   formatted="George Taylor">George Taylor</name>'s shallop, at the time when on her
<                passage from this borough to Philadelphia, she was brought to by a party belonging to
<                the Kings armed schooner <ship formatted="Diana">Diana</ship>, Captain Greaves
<                Commander, that on coming on board the shallop, an officer asked what was on board,
<                and being answered by Taylor, only rum and limes, and the officer demanding proper
<                papers, Taylor immediately produced them, The hatch was then opened and the hogsheads
<                counted and compared, which agreeing with the papers, the officer asked further,
<                whether Taylor had not something more on board, or in the cabin,and in a very
<                scoffing manner enquired whether he had not some teas, Taylor replied, he was welcome
<                to go into the cabin and see himself, assuring him at the same time that nothing was
<                on board besides the rum and limes: then the officer and two sailors went into the
<                cabin and stayed some time, on which Taylor went to the cabin door and looked in; the
<                Officer asked what he wanted, Taylor replied, I did not know there was any body in
<                the cabin but you ー the officer then got into a violent rage, cursing and swearing in
<                the most dreadful manner, and coming upon deck used many horrid imprecations and
<                threats against Taylor, that he would kick him over-board, &amp;c. for suspecting the
<                King's men, and still vaunting that he was a King's officer, at the same time
<                striking and wounding Taylor so that the deck was prodigiously besmeared with his
<                blood. ー And this affirmant farther saith, that Taylor gave not the least
<                provocation, but, on the contrary, both in his words and behavior shewed the greatest
<                respect and submission, and never resisted or attempted to touch the officer. The
<                shallop coming a breast the schooner, the Officer told Captain Graves, who was
<                walking on the quarter-deck of the schooner, that "this fellow has rum and limes on
<                board" whereupon the Capt. immediately got into the boat with several sailors, came
<                on board the shallop and without any examination highly approved of the conduct of
<                the officer in beating Taylor, (who at that time was leaning bleeding violently in
<                the cockpit) and said that if he had been on board he would have given him twice as
<                much, and threatened to kick his teeth down his throat, and to take him on board the
<                schooner, and there to tie him up and whip him. ー The Capt. then ordered four men
<                into the boat to tow the shallop along side the schooner, which had then drifted a
<                small distance a stern, but findings they could not tow her against the wind and
<                tide, the anchor was ordered out, and the Captain asking for the papers, they were
<                handed to him, and he having examined and found them authentick, ordered Taylor to go
<                about his business after having been detained nearly an hour and a half. ー And
<                further this affirmant saith not.</p>

<             <ind>
<                <p2>Sir  This Evening Intelligence hath been rec'd that about Twelve hundred of the
<                   Regulars have proceeded from Boston towards Concord, and having fired upon and
<                   killed a number of the Inhabitants of Lexington are now actually engaged in
<                   butchering and destroying our Brethern there in the most inhuman manner, that the
<                   Inhabitants oppose them with zeal and courage and numbers have already fallen on
<                   both sides ー Reinforcements were at Ten o'clock under Motion from Boston, and the
<                   Provincials were alarmed and mustering as fast as possible, it appears necessary
<                   therefore that we immediately make some provision for their assistance, and his
<                   Honor the Lieutenant General desires your immediate Attendance to advise and order
<                   in that behalf. His being very ill occasions my writing in his Behalf ー We shall
<                   impatiently wait your Arrival, as Numbers are ready and wait only Orders to
<                   proceedー</p2>
<                <p>The Countrys Friend and Yours</p>
<                <sig>S[tephen] Hopkins</sig>
<                <p2>Providence, Wednesday night Ten o'Clock</p2>
<                <p2>To Major General [Stephen] Potter.</p2>
<             </ind>
<             <p>Upon Receipt of this news the Town was thrown into Alarm, and all went into
<                preparation ー The Govr. issued Warrants for calling the Assembly to meet at
<                Providence next Saturday. Gen. Potter (who lives at Brtistol) set off this morning
<                with numbers from Bristol and Warren. None have marched from Newport to day, tho'
<                Col. Dayton tells me this afternoon that there are five hundred armed and ready to
<                march, waiting only the Governors Orders. The Tories have, in order to intimidate,
<                circulated thro' the Town that Capt. [James] Wallace of the <ship formatted="Rose"
<                   >Rose</ship> Man o' War, insolently says he will fire upon the Town, and lay it in
<                ashes, if any march from hence ー This intimidates some people. They are training,
<                exercising and preparing all day; It is said that the Regulars coming up with about
<                30 minute men exercising at Lexington, ordered them to lay down their arms ー that
<                upon Refusal, the Regulars dastardly fired upon them and killed six ー that the others
<                returned the fire and killed some of the Regulars ー But of this there is no certainty
<                ー Gov. Hopkins does not inform the basis of his Intelligence ー dont even date his
<                letter ー And it is not known whether the Troops marched to Lexington Yesterday
<                Morning, or before. It is probable the whole Country is thrown into the same alarm as
<                last September.<fn>2</fn> The good Lord direct and overrule all for his glory, and
<                the good of his Chosen ー It is happy that the Troops have given the first blow ー the
<                way is open and clear now for the Americans. If they will but tarry out of Boston a
<                few days, I doubt not the Americans will give a good Account of them. But I fear
<                their cowardice has made them instantly return to Boston. All that I rely upon in
<                this News is that they have marched to Lexington, and killed a few men. I am not a
<                little apprehensive that it may prove only another false alarm designedly excited by
<                our people to prevent the Troops from marching out of Boston into the Countryー</p>

>             ー The Govr. issued Warrants for calling the Assembly to meet at Providence next
>             Saturday. Gen. Potter (who lives at Brtistol) set off this morning with numbers from
>             Bristol and Warren. None have marched from Newport to day, tho' Col. Dayton tells me
>             this afternoon that there are five hundred armed and ready to march, waiting only the
>             Governors Orders. The Tories have, in order to intimidate, circulated thro' the Town

>             insolently says he will fire upon the Town, and lay it in ashes, if any march from hence
>             ー This intimidates some people. They are training, exercising and preparing all day; It

>             ordered them to lay down their arms ー that upon Refusal, the Regulars dastardly fired
>             upon them and killed six ー that the others returned the fire and killed some of the

<                   leave to represent to your Excellency, that the inhabitants of this city were this
<                   morning exceedingly alarmed by a report that a large quantity of gunpowder was in
<                   the preceding night, while they were sleeping in their beds, removed from the

<                   one of his Majesty's armed vessels lying at a ferry on James river.</p>
<                <p>We beg leave to represent to your Excellency, that as this magazine was erected at
<                   the public expence of this colony, and appropriated to the safe keeping of such
<                   munitions as should be there lodged from time to time, for the protection and
<                   security of the country, by arming thereout such of the militia as might be
<                   necessary in case of invasion and insurrections, they humbly conceive it to be the
<                   only proper repository to be resorted to in times of imminent danger.</p>
<                <p>We further beg leave to inform your Excellency, that, from various reports at
<                   present prevailing, in different parts of the country, we have too much reason to
<                   believe that some wicked and designing persons have instilled the most diabolical
<                   notions into the minds of our slaves, and that therefore the utmost attention to
<                   our internal security is become the more necessary.</p>
<                <p>The circumstances of this city, my Lord, we consider as peculiar and critical. The
<                   inhabitants, from the situation of the magazine, in the midst of the city, have,
<                   for a long tract of time, been exposed to all those dangers which have happened in
<                   many countries from explosions and other accidents. They have, from time to time
<                   thought it incumbent on them to guard the magazine. For their security they have,
<                   for some time past, judged it necessary to keep strong patrols on foot; in their
<                   present circumstance, they, to have the chief and necessary means of their defense
<                   removed, cannot but be extremely alarmed. Considering ourselves as guardians of
<                   the city we therefore humbly desire to be informed by your Excellency, upon what
<                   motives, and for what particular purpose, the powder has been carried off in such
<                   a manner; and we earnestly request your Excellency to order it to be immediately
<                   returned to the magazine.</p>
<             </ind>
<             <p>To which his Excellency returned this verbal answer: That, hearing of an insurrection
<                in a neighbouring county, 1 he had removed the powder from the magazine, where he did
<                not think it secure, to a place of perfect security; and that upon his word and
<                honour, whenever it was wanted in any insurrection, it should be delivered in half an
<                hour; that he had removed it in the night time to prevent any alarm, and that Captain
<                Collins had his express commands for the part he had acted; he was surprised to hear
<                the people were under arms on this occasion, and that he should not think it prudent

<                year Crops of Corn being cut short by the Drought &amp; so many of our People not
<                being Farmers but Lumbering Sailors &amp;ca togather with the Difficulty and Danger
<                there now is of getting any from the Southern Goverments, owing to their carefullness
<                to keep a sufficient supply for their own people in this day of Expence and the

<             <p2>Sir./  The Inhabitants of most of the Counties of this Colony are in Commotion, and
<                a Body of two Thousand Men are now Actually preparing to March to the Assault of my
<                House, defended only by my self and the Persons belonging to my Family, the Occasion
<                of which Insurrection is no greater than my having Conveyed from the Magazine in this
<                Town the Powder which was therein (and which I thought too much exposed there to the
<                Attempts of the People) to on Board a Man of War Stationed here, the only place of
<                Safety where it could be lodged.ー</p2>
<             <p>The Corporation of this place, have presented an Address to me under the Muskets of
<                their Independant Company which they left only at a little distance from my house
<                when they came to me to demand a restitution of the Powder which however I have not
<                Complied with, And their Armed Men thought proper unexpectedly to disperse, but I
<                have daily received fresh insults from other bodies of Armed Men appearing in Town
<                from the Country, and am now in expectation of the Arrival of the Above mentioned
<                People whose Numbers encourage them to persist in the Undertaking.</p>
<             <p>I have been Obliged to Send <name formatted="Lady Dunmore">Lady Dunmore</name> and my
<                Children on Board the <ship formatted="Fowey">Fowey</ship> Man of War, and with the
<                little though cheerfull Assistance given me by Captain [George] Montague and his

<                   >Magdalen</ship> Armed Schooner, Joined to the People of my own family I have put

<                expect to make any effectual resistance, if as is threatened the People make very
<                resolute efforts against us, and we shall theefore, probably be obliged to retire
<                towards the Ship, which I shall delay as long as is prudent: but these proceedings
<                already make the rebellious spirit of those people Sufficiently Manifest, and
<                therefore I think it Necessary to apply to you for such immediate Assistance, as the
<                Circumstances of the Affairs in which you are yourself engaged, and your Orders and
<                Instructions may permit you to Afford me. Two or Three Hundred Men or even one
<                Hundred would probably prevent my being driven out of the Government, and enable me
<                to Maintain an Entrenched Post on the Bank of one of the Rivers under the Protection
<                of the Guns of a Man of War, till I receive orders from Home, and by displaying the
<                Kings Standard perhaps our Numbers might be increased, by the well affected of the
<                Country, so as to be able to make head against the Insurgents, but without some
<                Appearance of force to protect the first who venture to me, I despair of receiving
<                any Assistance from the Country.</p>
<             <p>I write to the Admiral at the same time to request one of the large Ships to be sent
<                here which would have a very good effect, if the Service in which the Men of War are

<                <p>Friends and fellow soldiers: you have for a number of year past, been a scourge
<                   and terror to arbitrary power Your valor has been famed abroad, and acknowledged,
<                   as appears by the advice and orders to me, from the General Assembly of
<                   Connecticut, to surprise and take the garrison now before us. I now propose to
<                   advance before you, and, in person, conduct you through the wicket gate; for we
<                   must this morning either quit our pretensions to valor or possess ourselves of
<                   this fortress in a few minutes; and, inasmuch as it is a desparate attempt, which
<                   none but the bravest of men dare undertake, I do not urge it on any contrary to
<                   his will. You that will undertake voluntarily, poise your firelocks.</p>
<             </ind>
<             <p>The men being, at this time, drawn up in three ranks, each poised his firelock. I
<                ordered them to face to the right: and at the head of the centre file marched them
<                immediately to the wicket gate aforesaid, where I found a sentry posted, who
<                instantly snapped his fusee at me: I ran immediately towards him, and he retreated
<                through the covered way into the parade within the garrison, gave a halloo, and ran
<                under a bomb-proof. My party who followed me into the fort, I formed on the parade in
<                such a manner as to face the two barracks which faced each other.</p>
<             <p>The garrison being asleep, except the sentries, we gave three huzzas which greatly
<                surprised them. One of the sentries made a pass at one of my officers with a charged
<                bayonet, and slightly wounded him. my first thought was to kill him with my sword;
<                but, in an instant, I altered the design and fury of the blow to a slight cut on the
<                side of the head; upon which he dropped his gun, and asked quarter, which I readily
<                granted him, and demanded of him the place where the commanding officer kept; he
<                showed me a pair of stairs in the front of a barrack, on the west part of the
<                garrison, which led up to a second story in said barrack, to which I immediately
<                repaired, and ordered the commander, Captain Delaplace, to come forth instantly or I
<                would sacrifice the whole garrison; at which the Captain came immediately to the
<                door, with his breeches in his hand, when I ordered him to deliver me the fort
<                instantly:</p>
<             <p>He asked me by what authority I demanded it.</p>
<             <p>I answered him, "In the name of the great Jehovah, and the Continental Congress."</p>
<             <p>The authority of the Congress being very little known at that time, he began to speak
<                again; but I interrupted him, and, with my drawn sword over his head, again demanded
<                an immediate surrender of the garrison; with which he then complied, and ordered his
<                men to be forthwith paraded without arms, as he had given up the garrison: In the
<                mean time some of my officers had given orders, and in consequence thereof, sundry of
<                the barrack doors were beat down, and about one third of the garrison imprisoned,
<                which consisted of the said commander, a <name formatted="Lieutenat Feltham"
<                   >Lieutenat Feltham</name>, a conductor of artillery, a gunner, two serjeants, and
<                fortyfour rank and file; about one hundred pieces of cannon, one thirteen inch mortar
<                and a number of swivels. This surprise was carried out in the gray of the morning of
<                the tenth day of May 1775 . . .</p>
<             <p>Colonel Warner, with the rear guard, crossed the lake and joined me early in the

<                <p>You Cannot fail to Observe that Mr Arnold for the Defence of this Colony is

<                <p>this Step is taken in Consequence of Order given him by our Committee of Safety
<                   perhaps this may appear to You extraordinary; but we trust you will Candidly

<                   the least infraction upon or usurpation of the Jurisdiction of any of our Sister

<                   happen through the Exertions of Enterprising Spirits to be brought within the
<                   allowed Limits of this Colony and Come to our use we shall hold ourselves
<                   accountable for them to the Representation of the Continent; and whenever they

<                <p>As to the Expediency and policy of endeavouring to maintain those old Fortresses
<                   near lake Champlain, or abating them and erecting others in some other places upon
<                   the Same Lake or abandoning those Posts and bringing off all the ordnance and
<                   warlike Stores in those parts we Conceive that the advice of the Continental
<                   Congress ought to be obtained and we have therefore addressed them in the most
<                   pressing manner being of opinion that the maintaining a post there is absolutely

<                <p>Sir: The Congress have received yours of the 19th and 23d of May, ult., per
<                   Captain [Jonathan] Brown and Captain [Elisha] Phelps, a copy of which has been
<                   sent to New Hampshire. They highly approve of, and take great satisfaction in the
<                   acquisitions you have made at Ticonderoga, Crown Point, on the Lake, &amp;c. As to
<                   the state you are in respecting men, provisions, &amp;c. we have advices from
<                   Connecticut and New York, that ample preparation is making, with the greatest
<                   dispatch, in those two Colonies, from whence you may depend on being seasonably
<                   supplied. They are sorry to meet with repeated requests from you, that some
<                   Gentleman be sent to succeed you in command; they assure you, that they place the
<                   greatest confidence in your" fidelity, knowledge, courage and good conduct, and
<                   they desire that you at present dismiss the thoughts of quitting your important
<                   command at Ticonderoga, Crown Point, Lake Champlain, &amp;c.; and you are hereby
<                   requested to continue your command over the forces raised by this Colony, posted
<                   at those several places, at least until the Colony of <name>New York</name> or
<                   Connecticut shall take on them the maintaining and commanding the same agreeable
<                   to an order of the Continental Congress. To Colonel Benedict Arnold,
<                   Ticonderoga</p>
<                <p2>P.S. We have just received the intelligence by a Letter from Governour [Jonathan]
<                   Trumbull, that the General Assembly have ordered a thousand men to march
<                   immediately to re-enforce the Army now at Crown Point, Ticonderoga, &amp;c., as
<                   also five hundred pounds of powder, &amp;c. The Congress further advise that in
<                   case your present necessity requires it, you make use of the one hundred and sixty
<                   Pounds you found on board the Sloop, for the service of this Colony, you
<                   accounting for the same to this or some other Congress, or House of
<                   Representatives of this Colony; and they hereby assure you that this Colony will
<                   repay it whenever it shall be ordered by the Continental Congress, and that you
<                   also complete the raising the number of four hundred men, in the pay of this
<                   Colony, if you judge it necessary.</p2>
<                <ctr>To the House of Assembly of Connecticut</ctr>
<                <p>Gentlemen,  We gratefully acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 27th
<                   ultimo. We fully concur in opinion with you, that maintaining a post at
<                   Ticonderoga or Crown Point, is of the utmost importance; therefore take particular
<                   satisfaction that you have on this subject so early and repeatedly expressed your
<                   minds to the Continental Congress. By private intelligence of the 28th ultimo,
<                   sent to Captain Joseph Trumbull, we are informed that the Provincial Congress of
<                      <name>New York</name> do not understand the resolve of the Continental
<                   Congress, concerning said fortresses, to extend so far as to wholly dismantle
<                   them, but so far only as to supply any fortification that may be built at the
<                   south end of <name>Lake George</name>; which resolve, in this sense of it, they
<                   are with dispatch executing. Therefore, in our present distressing situation, we
<                   have postponed sending further assistance to Captain Arnold, especially since
<                      <name>New York</name> have not requested it.</p>
<                <p2>To the Hon. <name>William Williams</name>, Speaker of the House of Assembly of
<                   the Colony of Connecticut.</p2>
<                <ctr>To the Provincial Congress of New-Hampshire</ctr>
<                <p>Gentlemen,  We send you enclosed a copy of a letter from Colonel Arnold, commander
<                   of the Troops at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, together with a copy of a letter
<                   from the Speaker of the House of Representatives for the Colony of Connecticut, by
<                   which you will be acquainted with the present situation of those fortresses, and
<                   the measures necessary to be taken for securing and defending so valuable
<                   acquisitions. You will doubtless agree with us in sentiment, that it is a matter
<                   of the greatest importance that those places remain in our possession, in order to
<                   secure our frontiers from the depredations of our enemies, if they should attempt
<                   to attack it from that quarter, of which there appears to be great danger.</p>
<                <p>It was the agreement of this Colony, that four hundred men, and one hundred pounds
<                   in money, should be raised for the reduction of the place; and it is our
<                   determination to contribute our full proportion toward securing the acquisition.
<                   By the letter from the Speaker of the House of Representatives for Connecticut you
<                   will find that that Colony have voted to send immediately to their assistance four
<                   companies, and five hundred pounds weight of powder, and we suppose that the
<                   troops are upon the march there. And we most earnestly request that you would
<                   contribute your endeavburs likewise for the speedy and effective security of the
<                   aforementioned places, which, considering the importance of the affair, and the
<                   ready disposition which you have discovered for the defence of the common cause,
<                   leaves us no room to doubt of your compliance therewith.</p>
<                <p>To the Provincial Congress of New Hampshire.</p>

>                [Jonathan] Brown and Captain [Elisha] Phelps, a copy of which has been sent to New
>                Hampshire. They highly approve of, and take great satisfaction in the acquisitions
>                you have made at Ticonderoga, Crown Point, on the Lake, &amp;c. As to the state you
>                are in respecting men, provisions, &amp;c. we have advices from Connecticut and New
>                York, that ample preparation is making, with the greatest dispatch, in those two
>                Colonies, from whence you may depend on being seasonably supplied. They are sorry to
>                meet with repeated requests from you, that some Gentleman be sent to succeed you in
>                command; they assure you, that they place the greatest confidence in your" fidelity,
>                knowledge, courage and good conduct, and they desire that you at present dismiss the
>                thoughts of quitting your important command at Ticonderoga, Crown Point, Lake
>                Champlain, &amp;c.; and you are hereby requested to continue your command over the
>                forces raised by this Colony, posted at those several places, at least until the
>                Colony of <name>New York</name> or Connecticut shall take on them the maintaining and
>                commanding the same agreeable to an order of the Continental Congress. To Colonel
>                Benedict Arnold, Ticonderoga</p>
>             <p2>P.S. We have just received the intelligence by a Letter from Governour [Jonathan]
>                Trumbull, that the General Assembly have ordered a thousand men to march immediately
>                to re-enforce the Army now at Crown Point, Ticonderoga, &amp;c., as also five hundred
>                pounds of powder, &amp;c. The Congress further advise that in case your present
>                necessity requires it, you make use of the one hundred and sixty Pounds you found on
>                board the Sloop, for the service of this Colony, you accounting for the same to this
>                or some other Congress, or House of Representatives of this Colony; and they hereby
>                assure you that this Colony will repay it whenever it shall be ordered by the
>                Continental Congress, and that you also complete the raising the number of four
>                hundred men, in the pay of this Colony, if you judge it necessary.</p2>
>             <ctr>To the House of Assembly of Connecticut</ctr>
>             <p>Gentlemen,  We gratefully acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 27th ultimo.
>                We fully concur in opinion with you, that maintaining a post at Ticonderoga or Crown
>                Point, is of the utmost importance; therefore take particular satisfaction that you
>                have on this subject so early and repeatedly expressed your minds to the Continental
>                Congress. By private intelligence of the 28th ultimo, sent to Captain Joseph
>                Trumbull, we are informed that the Provincial Congress of <name>New York</name> do
>                not understand the resolve of the Continental Congress, concerning said fortresses,
>                to extend so far as to wholly dismantle them, but so far only as to supply any
>                fortification that may be built at the south end of <name>Lake George</name>; which
>                resolve, in this sense of it, they are with dispatch executing. Therefore, in our
>                present distressing situation, we have postponed sending further assistance to
>                Captain Arnold, especially since <name>New York</name> have not requested it.</p>
>             <p2>To the Hon. <name>William Williams</name>, Speaker of the House of Assembly of the

<                <sal>Gentlemen:</sal>
<                <p3>In Provincial Congress, New-York, June 7, 1775</p3>
<                <p>Upon receiving the resolutions of the Congress which relate to the fortifying
<                   King's Bridge, &amp;c., we appointed Committees to view those places. Our
<                   Committee from King's Bridge made a report the third instant, of which we send you
<                   a copy. We have only to add, that by reason of the easiness of approach, which
<                   will arise from the great irregularity of the ground on Manhattan's Island,
<                   especially to the northward, no fortification can be so constructed as to be
<                   tenable for any length of time; and even if such thing were practicable, yet if
<                   the enemy are superiour in the field, then, as they must necessarily command the
<                   rivers, such fortification might be reduced by famine, if not otherwise to be
<                   taken. It follows, therefore, that if the post is to be fortified, with a view to
<                   render it a magazine or place of arms, that no part of the island is properly
<                   adapted to that purpose.</p>
<                <p>Considering it in the light of a post for preserving the communication between the
<                   city and the country, upon a supposition that the rivers are occupied by
<                   ships-of-war, then if the place marked A were strong and capable of sustaining a
<                   regular siege, still a body of forces on the island could as effectually cut off
<                   the communication in many other places. On the other hand, if the enemy should
<                   possess themselves of the post A, besides that it is commanded by the two heights
<                   marked B, particularly Tippett's Hill, yet it would by no means serve to cut off
<                   the communication, because it would be easy to cross Harlem River in boats, with a
<                   body of forces, in several places, where no vessel-of-war could lay without being
<                   exposed to fire from such very high grounds as to be quite out of reach of her
<                   artillery; and also because that river is fordable in places which are covered
<                   from any fire which can be made from the said post. And not only would the enemy's
<                   possession be ineffectual for their purposes, it would also bring on them certain
<                   destruction; for that it would be very easy to cut off their retreat to the Town,
<                   and, from the great elevation of ground above the river, to prevent any relief
<                   which they would receive from vessels-of-war; wherefore, if we have the
<                   superiority in the field, they would be with great ease driven from that post, or
<                   starved in it.</p>
<                <p>This place, therefore (the only one which can secure the bridges,) being of little
<                   consequence to us, and of still less to them, we are of opinion that it would be
<                   very imprudent to fortify it at present, because the expense will be much greater
<                   than after we have troops embodied, who can perform much of the labour, and also
<                   for a reason mentioned in the report of our Committee.</p>
<                <p>You will take notice, gentlemen, that we have no ammunition, nor any Engineer ー
<                   two most necessary implements of war, you will certainly acknowledge; the first we
<                   hope for from the endeavours of our merchants, the last you will take some care to

<                <p>Be assured that we have the greatest willingness to obey the resolutions of the
<                   Grand Congress; and if in their wisdom they shall think fit to overrule the
<                   reasons which we have offered, doubt not that we shall use our utmost efforts to

<             <ind>
<                <p>The Report above mentioned is in the words following, to wit:</p>
<                <p>We, your Committee appointed to view the ground in the environs of King's Bridge,
<                   do most humbly report:</p>
<                <p>That in obedience to your commands we have examined the heights in that
<                   neighbourhood, taking such assistance as the shortness of the notice permitted us
<                   to procure, and are of opinion that a post (capable of containing three hundred
<                   men) erected on the high ground adjoining Mr. Hyatt's house, marked A in the
<                   annexed map, will answer the purpose proposed by the Continental Congress in their
<                   requisition, so far as the occupying that bridge can contribute to the keeping up
<                   a communication between the country and this city; for we beg leave to observe,
<                   that an enemy may land and seize on several posts in this island capable of
<                   interrupting, though not totally cutting off that communication held up as a point
<                   of so much importance by the Continental Congress. We are farther of opinion that
<                   this work should be constructed by troops when embodied and ready to ー occupy it,
<                   your Committee being humbly of opinion it would be the highest imprudence to erect
<                   a fortification before we have the means of defending it. By this mode of
<                   proceeding the expense will also be very much reduced. We believe that though
<                   there be no water immediately on the spot proposed for this post, yet means may be
<                   fallen upon to cover those who go to a well sunk in the adjoining low ground, near
<                   Mr. Hyatt's house, especially as we conceive this post is not supposed to sustain
<                   any regular attack, or of many hours' duration, without relief. We think fascines
<                   the cheapest and best materials to face this work, and that an abattis of fallen
<                   wood will contribute much to the security of the post. With respect to the
<                   particular form and dimensions, your Committee dare not venture (without the
<                   assistance of an Engineer) to recommend any particular plan to your consideration,
<                   and therefore pray your attention to provide a person _ of experience in this line
<                   of military science. All which is most humbly submitted.</p>

<                <p>That you make and give to the said Arnold, and any men whom he shall, by virtue of

<                   the money, ammunition, and other things, which he received at his setting out upon

<                   number which you shall find so retained shall be much short of the number which

<                   to be enlisted, and give the necessary orders for raising, enlisting, and
<                   maintaining them, for such term as you shall judge necessary for defence of said
<                   posts, and also appoint some sufficient and faithful man as Muster-Master and
<                   Paymaster of such men, and leave sufficient moneys in his hands for that purpose,
<                   taking proper receipts and his security that the money so left shall be applied to

<                   as you shall judge needful, in the best and most expeditious way you can, on the

<                <p2>Gentlemen:  In consequence of one of your Resolves, we appointed a Committee to
<                   view the Post in the Highlands, whose report, with a map thereto annexed, you have
<                   inclosed, which is all as yet we have been able to do respecting that matter. As
<                   soon as the proper measures on that head are concluded we will transmit them to
<                   you.</p2>
<                <p>We are, Gentlemen [&amp;c.]</p>
<             </ind>
<             <p2>To the New-York Delegates in the Continental Congress</p2>
<             <p>The Report mentioned in the above letter, is in the words following, to wit:</p>
<             <ind>
<                <p>Your committee in obedience to your order of the 10th ultimo,<fn>2</fn> do most
<                   humbly report, that taking to their assistance Capt, <name>Samuel Bayard</name>
<                   and Captain <name>Erasmus Williams</name>, they proceeded to the Highlands, and
<                   made a survey of the ground adjoining to Hudson River, for the purposes mentioned
<                   in the said order, and do report it as their opinion, that a post (capable of
<                   containing three hundred men) erected on the east bank of Hudson's river, marked
<                   A, and another on the west side of the said river, to contain 200 men, marked B in
<                   the annexed map, will answer the purpose proposed and directed by the Continental
<                   Congress. As it is not only the narrowest part of the said river, but best
<                   situated on account of the high hills contiguous it, as well on the west as east
<                   side of the river, which cover those parts, so that without a strong easterly
<                   wind, or the tide no vessel can pass it; and the tide in said part of the river is
<                   generally so reverse, that a vessel is usually thrown on one side of the river or
<                   the other, by means whereof such vessels lay fair and exposed to the places your
<                   committee have fixed on. Your committee are further of opinion, that the cheapest
<                   and best materials to face these works, would be stone and lime, as there are
<                   plenty of stone on the same, and adjoining to it, and lime can be had from a
<                   little distance up the river.</p>
<                <p>Your committee beg leave to observe, that they are informed that by means of four
<                   or five booms chained together on one side of the river ready to be drawn across,
<                   the passage can be closed up to prevent any vessel passing or repassing. Your
<                   committee are further of opinion, that if the last measure should be adopted, it
<                   would be requisite and highly prudent to place one or two cannon at the mouth of
<                   the Highlands, under the care and inspection of a faithful man, to alarm the
<                   troops to be embodied at the places proposed, in time of danger. Your committee
<                   are also further informed, and are of opinion that there is on the east side of
<                   the said river, near the place fixed on in the said annexed map, marked A, a good
<                   and convenient place to build a magazine for the lodgment of gunpowder and other
<                   stores. We believe that though there is no fresh water on the spot proposed for
<                   the east post, yet a good spring is near it, so that it can be conveyed thereto
<                   with a very small expense. We think it would be also necessary to build a number
<                   of small boats for maintaining a communication between the two posts.</p>
<                <p>Your committee are unable to make a true estimate of the expense that will attend
<                   the erecting the said fortifications, but from the best computation they are able
<                   to make, it will at least amount to £ 1500.</p>
<                <p>All of which is most humbly submitted by your committee</p>

<             <p>As the above account of the reduction of Ticonderoga, which from its complexion, I
<                suppose originated from that very <ital>modest</ital> gentleman, Col. [James] Easton
<                himself, is so replete with falshood, and is so great an imposition on the public,
<                that I think it my duty, in order to undeceive the public, and to do justice to
<                modest merit, to give you a candid detail of the whole matter, for the truth of which
<                I appeal to every officer and private who were present, which is as follows:</p>
<             <p>Some gentlemen arrived in the New-Hampshire grants from Connecticut, with a design of
<                seizing on the fortress of Ticonderoga, were there joined by a number of men, among
<                whom were Col. [Ethan] Allen and Easton, the former, with the assistance of Captain
<                [Seth] Warner, collected about 150 men, with whom they marched to Castletown, 20
<                miles from Ticonderoga, where they left Col. Easton, and proceeded 10 miles towards
<                Shoreham, the next day Col. [Benedict] Arnold, arrived at Castleton, from Cambridge,
<                having concerted in similar plan, and being commissioned by the Massachusetts
<                Congress to raise a regiment, he proceeded on to the party under the command of
<                Colonel Allen, <flag>----</flag> when Col. Arnold made known his commission, &amp;c
<                   <flag>----</flag> it was voted by the officers present, that he should take a
<                joint command with Col. Allen (Col. Easton not presuming to take any command)
<                   <flag>----</flag> When the party had marched to Shoreham, two miles on the Lake
<                below Ticonderoga, where they waited for batteaus to cross the Lake, until midnight,
<                and none arriving, Col. Arnold, with much difficulty, persuaded about 40 men to
<                embark with him in a batteau accidentally taken there, and landed half a mile from
<                the fort, and immediately sent back the batteau, which by reason of a violent storm
<                of wind and rain did not return until break of day with a small boat, and near 50 men
<                in both, <flag>----</flag> It was then proposed by some gentlemen to wait open day,
<                and the arrival of the remainder of the men which amounted at that time to near 100;
<                this Col. Arnold strenuously opposed, and urged to storm the fort immediately,
<                declaring he would enter it alone, if no man had courage to follow him
<                   <flag>----</flag> this had the desired effect, he with Col. Allen headed the party
<                and proceeded directly to the fort <flag>----</flag> when they came within about 10
<                yards of the gate, the centry discovered them and made a precipitate retreat, he was
<                pursued closely by Col. Arnold, who was the first person that entered the fort, and
<                Col. Allen about 5 yards behind him <flag>----</flag> this I was an eye witness of
<                being only a few yards distant. <flag>----</flag> Col. Arnold immediately order'd the
<                men to secure the doors of the barracks, and went himself with Col. Allen to the
<                commanding officer, Captain De la Place, and desired him to deliver up his arms, and
<                he might expect to be treated like a gentleman, which he immediately complied with,
<                as did the whole garrison.</p>
<             <p>I do not recollect seeing Col. Easton until 9 o'clock, and was told he was the last
<                man that entered the fort, and that, not till the soldiers and their arms were
<                secured, he having concealed himself in an old barrack near the redoubt, under the
<                pretence of wiping and drying his gun, which he said had got wet in crossing the
<                Lake. Since which I have often heard Col. Easton, in a base and cowardly manner abuse
<                Col. Arnold behind his back, though always very complaisant before his face
<                   <flag>----</flag> Col. Arnold was soon made acquainted with the liberty he had
<                taken with his character, and upon his refusing to give proper satisfaction, I had
<                the pleasure of seeing him heartily kicked by Colonel Arnold, to the great
<                satisfaction of a number of gentlemen present, although he (Easton) was armed with a
<                cutlass, and a pair of loaded pistols in his pocket.</p>

<                <p3>Boston 17 May 1775</p3>
<                <p>The Stoppage of Provisions from the Southern Governments for the use of his

<                   Cannot a Vessell be Freighted with Flour for the West Indies, commanded by a

<                   up a Vessell as large as 200 Tons and give her a full Freight. I shoud send you
<                   Bills on the Contractors to execute this plan, or advise you to draw on them for
<                   the Amount of what you may ship to me in this way, but the Negotiation of such
<                   Bills might discover your Plan and defeat it, so that I should be glad you would
<                   advise me of some Friend of yours, and when I am made acquainted with his Name,
<                   and that Sum you shall draw for, will send to him from hence my Bills on the
<                   Contractors for the Amount you advise me of; you will plan likewise to give the
<                   Contractors timely Notice, that they may insure their Interest if they think
<                   proper, and inform me of the Name of the Vessel and Master you engage, that I may
<                   lodge a Permit at the Lighthouse in this Harbour, for Admission to come up to the
<                   Town, and discharge her Cargo here ー Pray let the Flour you purchase be such as
<                   will keep the Summer, and let the Casks be good, well hooped, and the Heads well
<                   secured with Lining Hoops ー You will be careful to write me by a safe Conveyance,
<                   that your Letter may not fall into the Hands of the Provincials.</p>

<             <p>That as to the effects brought to his camp last night, he had ordered them to be

<                there by some persons without his knowledge or directions; that one Brasher informed
<                him that Col. [Rudolphus] Ritzema had desired him to receive and protect those
<                effects; and, therefore, he had set a guard over them, and they were ready to be

<             <p>The Army and remaining Inhabitants in the Town of Boston are in great want of Fuel
<                and Provisions.</p>
<             <p>The Officers of the Customs stationed at Marblehead for the purpose of carrying into
<                execution the Boston Port Bill have been obliged to remove from thence, &amp; that

<             <p3>In Provincial Congress, August 2, 1775</p3>
<             <p>Whereas it appeared to the Committee of Safety, appointed by this Congress during
<                their late recess, that a Boat belonging to <name formatted="His Majesty">His
<                   Majesty</name>'s Ship <ship formatted="Asia">Asia</ship>, was with- out any
<                provocation attacked, and most wantonly destroyed: And whereas, the Corporation of
<                this City had, under the sanction of the said Committee, ordered another Barge to be
<                built, in order to replace the Barge so destroyed as aforesaid: And whereas, this

<                some disorderly and evil disposed persons did, in the night, destroy and render
<                useless the said Barge, so ordered to be built as aforesaid, by sawing it in pieces:
<                And whereas, the Corporation have since formally applied to this Congress for their
<                direction in the premises:</p>
<             <p><ital>Resolved</ital>, That the perpetrators of the said act are guilty of a high
<                offense and insult against this Congress and the Colony they represent, as
<                endeavouring to contravene the true intent and meaning of their appointment. That

<             <ctr>Proposal Concerning Bermuda</ctr>
<             <p>In order to continue the Exports from America to foreign Markets, it is proposed that
<                all non-enumerated Goods be permitted to be imported into Bermuda from the Continent
<                upon proper and sufficient Assurances from the Inhabitants of that Island that they
<                will not infringe that part of the Continental Association which relates to
<                Exports.</p>
<             <p>For this purpose the Cargoes must be discharged in Bermuda in order to obtain a
<                certificate to cancel the Bond given at the Custom Houses in America in obedience to
<                the restraining Bill.</p>
<             <p>In order to give a Colour to the Trade being carried on by the Inhabitants of Bermuda
<                (since it might possibly endanger the success should it be carried on in the name of
<                the Americans, as Hostilities have commenced between Great Britain and the
<                Continent,) the Invoices, Bills of Lading &amp;c. should be made out there and
<                executed in the Name of the Inhabitants of that Island.</p>
<             <p>Perhaps it might not be amiss to appoint Committees of Inspection, whose Business it
<                should be to see that no Vessel should sail from any port on the Continent untill
<                Charter Parties, or other Engagements be entered into for the landing such
<                Commodities as should be taken on board, in Bermuda without Fraud or Covin.</p>
<             <p>A Committee should likewise be appointed in Bermuda to prevent the re-exportation of
<                any Commodities imported from the Continent, to any place except what the Congress
<                shall allow. And the same Precautions should there be taken as on the Continent.</p>
<             <p>For the same Reasons that the Invoices and Bills of Lading should be made out in the
<                name of the Agents in Bermuda, the Charter parties should also be executed in the

<                <p>Whereas, the Arbitrary and Tyrannical proceedings of the British Ministry, in
<                   attempting to reduce the good people of America into a state of abject Slavery and
<                   Vassalage, has met with a righteous and Spirited Opposition from the twelve united
<                   Colonies by their Delegates in Congress, who, by their resolves of the 18th July,
<                   recommended to the Assemblies or Conventions, or in their recess, to the
<                   Committees of Safety, to devise and provide such means for defending the Lives,
<                   Liberties, and properties of their respective inhabitants, as may to them seem
<                   best in compliance with this recommendation; and in consequence of the powers
<                   vested in this Committee by Resolve of the Assenlbly of this Province, they have
<                   caused Sundry Boats to be Built and Armed for the defence of the Same, and the

<                   that they be immediately manned and equiped: <ital>Therefore</ital>, to encourage
